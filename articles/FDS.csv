Especially that high level of defensibility and resilience is important as it usually creates a wide moat around the business making it an investment one can hold for several decades. One of these companies might be the financial services company FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS), that is providing financial data, index services or portfolio data management.Referring to my last two articles about the two luxury goods companies LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE (OTCPK:LVMHF) and The Estee Lauder Companies (EL), we once again can mention a more or less stable operating margin for FactSet, stable growing revenues and an impressive performance during past recessions as well as an average RoIC of 34.82% over the last ten years as strong hints for a high-quality business.(Source: Pixabay)However, I already want to anticipate my conclusion. Looking at the fundamental business is a very important part of any analysis, but we also have to look at the price we have to pay for a business. Despite being a great business with the potential to grow at a high pace, the current stock price is not reflecting the true intrinsic value of the business anymore. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves and start with a brief business description.FactSet Research Systems Inc. is a financial data and software company and a global provider of integrated financial information as well as analytical applications and is offering services for the investment and corporate communities. The company is providing research, portfolio construction, trade execution, risk management, reporting and portfolio analysis. It was founded in 1978 and had its IPO in 1996.(Source: FactSet Investor Presentation)For the full year 2019, FactSet reported a revenue of $1,435 million, but aside from reported revenue, the annual subscription value (ASV) is an extremely important metric. ASV is representing the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently supplied to clients. It includes those fees billed in the last 12 months that are not subscription-based. As of February 29, 2020, and based on the last twelve months, the organic growth rate was 5.0% and the total ASV and professional services (revenues derived from project-based consulting and implementation) was $1.52 billion. In the third quarter of 2020, 84.1% of the ASV came from buy-side clients and 15.9% came from sell-side clients. The growth rate from buy-side clients was 4.5% and from sell-side clients, it was 5.6%.FactSet is reporting in four different segments – research solutions, analytics and trading solutions, wealth solutions as well as content and technology solutions:When looking at FactSet and its position within the industry, we first have to point out that the financial information services industry is very competitive with many major players like Bloomberg, Morningstar Inc. (MORN), MSCI Inc. (MSCI) or S&P Global Inc. (SPGI). And although I have written countless times in the past, that being an industry leader is not enough to create a wide economic moat, FactSet doesn’t even have the advantage of size compared to its peers. But especially when looking at return on invested capital (a very important metric in my opinion), FactSet seems to be able to outperform its peers. And it seems hard to dispute that FactSet has a wide economic moat around its business and this competitive advantage is mostly based on switching costs.(Source: FactSet Investor Presentation)These switching costs are illustrated by some key operational metrics in the chart above. FactSet had a client retention rate of 89% (clients retained over the last twelve months) and more than 95% of the annual subscription value retained from clients over the last twelve months.These switching costs mostly stem from steep learning costs, that most companies and clients are trying to avoid. A company might have to train its staff to use another platform and the knowledge how to use FactSet’s tools and programs that many employees might have gained over the years suddenly is lost. To understand the whole functionality of a platform takes a lot of time. Especially smaller companies don’t have the time and/or financial resources to double these investments they already made (considering money as well as time).Additionally, these systems and the provided data might also be embedded in other applications or software the company uses and this embeddedness is creating high switching costs as it would take a lot of time to “fix” this. So even if another company comes along with a slightly better or cheaper product many customers won’t switch as the process of switching costs a lot more than the company would save and this is creating pricing power for FactSet.FactSet not only has a wide economic moat based on switching costs, it also seems to have a pretty recession-proof business – at least when looking at the performance during the last two recessions. And this might also be a reason why FactSet is trading at such high multiples. When looking at the performance during the recession after the Dotcom bubble, we see strong growth numbers for the years between 2000 and 2004. Aside from revenue, which increased with a high pace every year, FactSet could also increase its net income and diluted earnings per share. In these four years between 2000 and 2004, revenue could increase with a CAGR of 18.80% and earnings per share increased with a CAGR of even 23.47% - these are extremely impressive numbers, especially in a time where many other companies struggled.(Source: FactSet Annual Report 2004)When looking at the years during the Financial Crisis (between 2007 and 2011), the picture is similar although the growth rates are not so impressive anymore (but we have to remember how countless companies suffered in the years 2008 and 2009). Revenue increased with a CAGR of 11.16% between 2007 and 2011 and earnings per share increased with a CAGR of 13.97%.(Source: FactSet Annual Report 2011)This is a really strong performance and when a company can report such strong growth numbers during two recessions it is pretty impressive.The important question now is, if FactSet can grow with a similar pace in the years to come. When looking at the growth rates of the last two and a half decades, it seems pretty obvious that growth is slowing down for FactSet (although there are some huge fluctuations, the overall trend seems to be pretty clear).Although FactSet performed impressively during the last two recessions, we might expect that a potentially declining stock market as well as the recession might have a negative impact on FactSet’s business. When markets decline and the economy tanks, people usually don’t invest as much money as before and withdraw funds which means that there might be less institutions that need FactSet’s services. And those institutions left (including the big banks) might cut their staff, which will also decrease the number of employees using FactSet’s services and also decreases the annual subscription revenue.In the last eight quarters, year-over year growth was only in the low-to-mid-single digits. We can assume, that growth rates might improve again after the recession, but for the next few quarters, we have to assume rather low growth. In the last 10 years, FactSet profited from a long-lasting bull market as well as a trend towards automation and data-driven investment, that is heavily relying on the services companies like FactSet provide. However, it is hard to say if this trend will last. I would assume so, but we can’t deny that growth was slowing down for FactSet (as mentioned above) and without a catalyst I am skeptical if FactSet can report consistent double-digit revenue growth again. When looking at the earnings estimates, analysts are also expecting a growth slowdown in the next few years and are assuming EPS and revenue only to grow in the mid-to-high single digits. As we will see below, management is a little more optimistic and assumes double-digit EPS growth in the next few years (at least it did before COVID-19).When trying to balance the positive and negative aspects, revenue growth in the high single digits still seems realistic, but I don’t think FactSet can return to the growth rates it reported 10 or 15 years ago.Dividend and Share Repurchase ProgramFactSet is also trying to reward its shareholders by distributing money via dividend and share buybacks. The company is actually spending a lot of money on share repurchases and considering the high share price (we will get to that aspect later), we have to question that strategy. Nevertheless, FactSet has very low capital spending (over the last few years only 11.5% of operating cash flow had to be spent on capital expenditures) which leads to high amounts of free cash flow and FactSet is using a lot of that free cash to buy back shares. Since 2008, the company decreased the number of outstanding shares about 23%.(Source: FactSet Investor Presentation)Aside from share buybacks, FactSet is also paying a dividend and according to Seeking Alpha, it increased its dividend for 21 consecutive years. Currently, FactSet is paying an annual dividend of $3.08 resulting in a payout ratio of 30% (it was also in that range in the last few years). Over the last 10 years, the dividend increased with a CAGR of 13.63%, but the current dividend yield is only 0.91%.I already mentioned at the beginning that FactSet is a great business (with a wide economic moat and impressive performance during recessions), but it is not a great investment as the current stock price (and market capitalization) is not justified by the cash the business can generate in the years to come (at least not when the expected return should be higher than only a low single-digit yield).When trying to make assumptions about growth rates in the years to come, we can look at management’s own guidance and mid-term growth rates. And although these projected growth rates are from September 2019 (and several months before COVID-19 was an issue), I would still consider these numbers as realistic mid-term targets.(Source: FactSet Investor Presentation)We already mentioned above that growth rates slowed down over time, but since 2000, FactSet could increase its revenue with a CAGR of 13.66%. In the last ten years, the CAGR was only 9.37%. Since 2000, net income increased with a CAGR of 14.89%, but in the last ten years, the CAGR also declined to 9.98%. And especially in the last few quarters, growth numbers were only in the mid-single digits. In the second quarter of 2020, revenue increased 4.2% while diluted earnings per share increased 5.0%.But let’s be optimistic and assume that FactSet can grow with a similar pace as in the last two decades and free cash flow will continue to grow with a CAGR of 13% over the next ten years (with growth stemming from a combination of revenue growth, improved margins and share buybacks) and following that we assume a 7% growth rate till perpetuity (I never use a higher number than 6% till perpetuity, but let’s be optimistic for FactSet as it has performed in an impressive manner during the last 20 years). Using these numbers (and a 10% discount rate), would lead to an intrinsic value of $118.23 and would make the stock still extremely overvalued.One could now argue that 7% growth till perpetuity is too pessimistic. While that might be true, we have to put the numbers in perspective to other companies and several other intrinsic value calculations. For several other companies, that performed similar to FactSet and also grew in the double digits, I assumed “only” 6% growth till perpetuity (as we never know what might happen) and we got stocks that sometimes are fairly valued, in some cases are overvalued 30% or in some rare cases are even 100% overvalued.But I can’t remember any intrinsic value calculation – optimistic intrinsic value calculation! – where the stock was still trading for three times its intrinsic value. There are many other companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO), Mastercard (MA) or Visa (V) which report similar numbers as FactSet and that have an even better business model, but I never used such optimistic growth assumptions and these stocks appeared not nearly as overvalued as FactSet. Mastercard would be the most expensive of the three mentioned stocks as it is trading with a premium of 45% right now. Twist it how you will, FactSet is extremely expensive and there are many other stocks trading at much more reasonable valuations with a similar good business model.FactSet had been a great investment in the past two and a half decades. If you had bought the stock on the day of the IPO, it would have returned 7,520% (without dividends). The S&P 500 (SPY) returned only 375% in the same time frame. And although FactSet has a good business model, I can’t justify an investment in FactSet. Maybe other investors know something I missed, but I don’t know where the optimism about FactSet stems from and right now a rating has to be bearish – although that does not mean that the stock has to fall in the coming weeks or months or that you should short the stock."
4374756,20715,2020-09-16T15:52:19-04:00,FactSet Research Systems is set to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings on September 24.The company's fundamental indicators and sentiment indicators seem to be at odds.The stock has been trending steadily higher over the last few years with a trend channel defining the various cycles in the overall trend.,"Each week I sit down and look at the earnings calendar for the following week. I look at several factors to determine whether a company is worth writing about or not-how heavily followed is the stock, the fundamental ratings from Investor's Business Daily, and the sentiment indicators. The stocks I choose to write about vary based on what I find. When I was doing my preliminary research for the week of September 21-25, FactSet Research Systems (FDS) jumped out at me and wasn't because the stock was heavily followed. The reason FactSet jumped out at me was how opposed the fundamentals and the sentiment seem to be.First off, FactSet is a financial firm that provides information, analytical applications, and trading tools to the investment industry. The company is based in Norwalk, Connecticut and was founded in 1978.The company is set to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings results on Thursday, September 24 before the market opens. The company has scheduled a conference call for 11:00 Eastern Time to discuss the results.Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2.54 per share for the fourth quarter and that is down slightly from the $2.61 the company reported in the fourth quarter of 2019.Seeing earnings shrink instead of grow would be out of the ordinary for FactSet as the company has seen earnings grow by an average of 15% per year over the last three years and the company saw earnings increase by 9% in the third quarter. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 5% for 2020 as a whole.Revenue for the company has increased at a rate of 7% per year over the last three years and it increased by 3% in the third quarter. Revenue is expected to increase by 3.9% for the fourth quarter and by 3.8% for the year.The earnings and revenue growth are good, but not great. Something that is great for FactSet is the management efficiency measurements. The return on equity is extremely high at 64.9% and the profit margin is well above average at 32.1%.Overall, I would say that the fundamental indicators for the company are above average and they are given a boost by the ROE and the profit margin. That's why I was very surprised by the readings for the sentiment indicators.Before we get into the actual readings for the sentiment indicators, you should know that I view the sentiment in a contrarian manner. If analysts are too bearish, that is good for the stock because it means there is a better chance for upgrades than downgrades. If the short interest ratio is too high, that can help the stock rally as short sellers can add buying pressure if they are forced to cover their positions.Analysts are indeed extremely bearish toward the stock. There are currently 16 analysts covering the stock with nine ""hold"" ratings and seven ""sell"" ratings. I usually view these ratings in terms of the number of ""buy"" ratings as a percentage of the total ratings, but in the case of FactSet there aren't any buy ratings. This means the buy percentage is 0%. The average stock's buy percentage falls in the 65% to 75% range. Given the solid fundamental indicators for the company, these analysts' ratings are hard to believe.The short interest ratio is also extremely bearish with a current reading of 6.2. The average short interest ratio falls in the 3.0 level, so FactSet's ratio is much higher and that is indicative of a more bearish stance toward the stock. There are 1.36 million shares sold short and that reading increased from 1.28 million in the second half of August. The stock only sees around 220K shares change hands each day.A third sentiment indicator that I like to look at is the put/call ratio. The ratio for FactSet isn't all that relevant because there isn't a great deal of options traded on the stock. There are only 574 puts open at this time and 516 calls. As far as the ratio, that would be 1.11, but the total number of shares represented by the total open interest is only 109K shares.Seeing all three of these sentiment indicators skewed to the bearish side is very surprising for a company with good fundamental indicators. I have seen companies with far more bullish sentiment indicators with terrible fundamental indicators. But like I said in the beginning of this section, extreme bearish sentiment is good.Turning our attention to the weekly chart for FactSet, we see that the stock was in overbought territory at the end of August, but the quick bout of selling that hit the market in the first few weeks of September caused the stock to dip. The dip brought the oscillators down out of overbought territory.The 10-week RSI was hovering right at 70, but the quick pullback brought the indicator down to the 50 area over the last few weeks. The weekly stochastic indicators were in overbought territory and they have now turned lower.I drew the trend channel to reflect the rally that has happened for the stock over the last few years. The lower rail connects the lows from December '18 and September '19. The stock did drop below the lower rail in March, but I did take note that the low from the quick pullback in early May hit the lower rail also. The stock appears to have reversed course at this time, but it is only one week so far.As far as trying to time an entry to buy the stock, ideally the stock would pull back to the lower rail when the lower rail gets in the $300 area. The stock struggled to get through $300 in the middle of 2019 and again in February of this year. The 52-week moving average is just below $300 and climbing. This could mean the convergence of the lower rail of the channel and the 52-week all occurring at a key point of resistance from the past. The problem with trying to wait for such a setup is that it might not happen, given the current sentiment outlook for the stock.My overall stance on FactSet is a bullish one. The fundamentals are pretty solid and the sentiment toward the stock is far more bearish than it should be. The chart shows how the stock has been trending higher for the last few years. The rally hasn't been a fast one, but rather a slow steady ascent.As for the earnings report, FactSet has beaten estimates in each of the last eight quarters, so it would be surprising to see them miss now. Even though investors love to track whether a company beats estimates or not, the only thing that really matters is how investors react to the news. The stock has rallied after each of the last three earnings reports and if the sentiment was as bearish in those instances as it is now, that is understandable. When the sentiment is as bearish as FactSet's is, the odds of an upward move are much greater than a downward move. At least that has been my experience.The stock gapped 7.5% higher after the earnings report in June and continued to rally for a few months. The earnings report in March didn't produce a big gap higher, but the stock rallied for a couple of months after that report as well. The same thing happened in December where the stock didn't gap higher, but it trended higher for a few months and gained 15% along the way.The one time in the last year that the stock gapped lower after earnings was last September. The company beat its EPS estimate by 5.7%, but the stock dropped by 7.7% that morning. The stock would move lower for a few more days and would then rally.Overall, I would say the odds favor a move higher after earnings rather than a move lower. That outlook is based on the bearish sentiment indicators and the past moves after earnings. If you own the stock already, I would suggest holding on to it. If you are looking to buy it, I think you can buy it ahead of the report, but if you want to play it safe, you can wait 'til after the report. The stock has been higher 60 days after each of the last four earnings reports. The gains have ranged greatly, but there have been gains in each case.I think as long as the fundamentals remain strong and as long as the stock remains above its 52-week moving average, I will remain bullish on FactSet."
4356179,104952,2020-06-29T11:39:48-04:00,FactSet expects more adoptions of its Analytics and CTS offerings in Q4.The combination of price increase and rebound momentum in APAC should also help drive higher ASV growth.FactSet beat the Q3 guidance and paid the dividend despite the crisis. It also raised the lower end of its organic growth guidance from $50 million to $60 million.,"We maintain our overweight rating on FactSet (NYSE:FDS), which has been outperforming despite the pandemic. The share price has also been up ~18% since our first coverage last August, where we discussed FactSet’s strong and steady qualities, characterized by the earnings growth and sticky client base. In Q3, FactSet beat its guidance and also raised the lower end of its organic ASV and professional services growth from $50 million to $60 million. Going into Q4, we believe that FactSet will continue to benefit from its price increase initiatives and the strong demand for its Wealth, CTS (Content and Technology Solutions), and Analytics offerings from new as well as existing clients.Deep sector content across financials, insurance, and real estate should allow FactSet to strengthen its CTS offering and gain traction in the corporates, expanding its TAM and increasing vertical penetration. A highlight in Q3 was FactSet’s 55 new client wins, which reportedly came from corporates and wealth management segments.(Alternative data sets. Source: Open.factset.com)As FactSet continues to partner with content providers and invest in enriching its alternative data sets across sectors such as financials, insurance, or real estate, we think that it is in a good position to leverage its CTS offering to expand its buyer demographics within the corporate segments longer term. A quick look at FactSet's homepage also reveals the breadth and depth of its alternative data sets and content so far.In the meantime, the effect of price increase, strong sales execution, continuing market share gains for Wealth, and growth in Analytics and CTS into Q4 should help drive ASV growth and margin expansions. Wealth will continue to be a key segment for FactSet, and given its 10% share of the overall business, it presents continuous cross-sell and upsell opportunities. In Q3, FactSet secured a seven-figure Wealth win at an existing client. Along with Research, the Wealth segment drove the overall 5% growth in Q1. While Research was largely popular in the Americas, the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in APAC means the rebound in the region should continue driving market share gains of Wealth offering. Besides, the international price increase should also drive ASV growth in the region. APAC is the fastest-growing region, with a 9% growth in Q1. Based on our experience as an APAC-based investor, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, which were the regions FactSet saw most of the growth, present attractive opportunities for Wealth expansion, given the large concentration of family offices in the regions.(FY 2020 guidance. Source: company’s earnings call slide)As indicated by the company’s 10-K, Wealth, Analytics, and CTS were driving the ASV growth in almost all regions. In the Q3 earnings call, however, the management indicated that it should expect Analytics and CTS to drive growth in Q4. In our view, given the increasing trend of a rebound in APAC, FactSet can potentially generate more than 2% growth coming from new businesses in Q4, considering that Q4 tends to be the biggest quarter. As we also consider the effect of price increase, FactSet can possibly beat its revenue and margin guidance for the full year. In Q3, the company already raised its growth guidance from a more conservative $50 million-$75 million provided in March to a narrower range of $60 million-$75 million.As indicated by its filings, there is some modest concentration of revenue around some of FactSet’s large clients, which we think can present a challenge if the concentration continues to increase and also move in lockstep with the company's client retention, which trended down YoY from 91% to 89% in Q3:FactSet is a blended income and growth opportunity that proves to be resilient amid the crisis, in which it has continued beating its guidance and paying the dividend. The differentiated offering in Wealth, along with the continuing investment into deeper and sector-specific content, should also strengthen its open ecosystem play, which will drive it closer to its high-single-digit ASV growth longer term.(EPS source: Seeking Alpha)When it comes to profitability, FactSet has always been outperforming. Amid the pandemic in Q3, FactSet even had a meaningful EPS beat and is on track to deliver a +$10 diluted EPS for the full year.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)FactSet also continues to pay a $0.72 dividend per share and exercise its share repurchases program. As of March 24, the company had authorized over $300 million worth of share repurchases. The company has already exercised $173 million YTD. The stock is currently trading at ~33x P/S, though over the last two years, its P/E has been relatively steady between 30x and 35x. We think that the shares can potentially trade at the higher end of the range upon the earnings surprise in Q4, driven by the catalysts and more positive outlook for Q1 2021."
4355896,50602,2020-06-29T07:00:00-04:00,"FactSet stock popped after a huge fiscal Q3 earnings beat, surprising bulls, the Street, and bears - myself included.The positive results revolve around lower COVID-related expenses and a debatable non-GAAP adjustment worth highlighting.FactSet's customers are still struggling and uncertain amid the pandemic - FactSet has said nothing about 2021 expectations.I'm continuing to avoid the stock at ~32x 2021 earnings.","On May 18, I published an article titled ""The Active Gold Rush Is Over, And FactSet Is Stuck With The Shovels"", where I shed some light on the business model and argued that FactSet was facing a challenging operating environment in the wake of COVID-19 and the rapid shift toward passive investing. I want to revisit this thesis and update my thoughts after FactSet reported fiscal Q3 earnings on June 25, and talk about the impact of the results on competitors and the market data industry as a whole.FactSet reported fiscal Q2 earnings in late March at the height of the COVID-19 panic for both markets and the economy. 2020 guidance that already reflected a tepid outlook for revenue and EPS growth was lowered, reflecting uncertainty among FactSet's customers on market data spend and investment for the remainder of the year:(Source: Seeking Alpha)As fiscal Q3 wore on, revenue and earnings estimates came down to reflect the updated guidance, and a stock that had outperformed the market pre-COVID began to move in-line with the broader averages:Data by YChartsThen, on June 25, FactSet reported an impressive EPS beat with revenue largely in-line, signaling substantial margin expansion and causing the stock to jump 15% in one day:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Data by YChartsWith the stock now modestly higher than the day my pessimistic article published, it's time to take a hard look at the anti-bullish thesis and check whether the negative outlook still holds true.Below shows a high level summary of FactSet's results and YoY growth vs. Q3 2019:(Source: FactSet)FactSet's subscription model flexed its muscles in Q3 - while most of the company's revenue is largely locked-in for the year, variable expenses can be scaled back quickly when the need arises. With COVID-19 forcing employees to work from home, discretionary costs like travel, entertainment and some facilities costs came down precipitously. The company also pointed to lower health insurance costs as employees had less hospital and doctor's visits. The better than expected expense story certainly contributed to the upside surprise and the positive stock reaction.The other driver comes from guidance - because of the expense savings and a lower tax rate, FDS was able to raise 2020 EPS guidance above its original range at the start of 2020 - now projecting 5% EPS growth at the midpoint vs. original guidance of flat growth:(Source: FactSet)With all the positive news out today, where did the negative thesis go? I'll explain my thoughts below:FactSet's upbeat story is built on non-GAAP results and forward guidance, which involve adjusting out certain financial items management believes are one-time in nature and not relevant to the focus of most investors. In Q3, FactSet made 2 important non-GAAP adjustments I think are worth highlighting. The first adjustment was to the tax rate:(Source: FactSet)This makes sense; FactSet had certain one-time tax expenses in Q3 2019 that did not repeat in Q3 2020, so the company took this out of the comparison to make results more apples-to-apples.The second adjustment is less straightforward, and more important:(Source: FactSet)To untangle: in Q3 2020, FactSet incurred $5.5 million of expenses related to their 3 year investment plan, in the form of legal/consulting fees and facilities costs (like double rent on multiple leases, etc..) that they argue are one-time in nature and should be excluded from the results investors should focus on.Let's look at these two adjustments in the context of FactSet's broader results - below compares GAAP growth rates to non-GAAP growth rates for Q3:(Source: FactSet)While the ~$5 million tax adjustment generally offsets the expense adjustment to make EPS growth look similar GAAP vs. non-GAAP, the adjustments change the story from ""growth driven by 1x tax items"" to ""growth driven by expense management and expanding operating margins"". Certainly a key change in the minds of investors and worth understanding.Whether the consulting & facilities costs are worth non-GAAPing are up for debate, but I personally don't think they should be excluded from expenses. FactSet is spending this money as part of their 3 year investment plan and will in theory realize revenue in the future from these investments - revenue they most likely will take credit for. Shouldn't management be responsible for the initial investment spending?During the earnings conference call, UBS analyst Alex Kramm made a similar call out:(Source: Seeking Alpha)While non-GAAP results look good on first glance, closer examination reveals a muddied picture that is worth understanding fully before buying the headline positivity.With a highly visible and stable revenue model at FactSet, analysts and investors pay close attention to annual subscription value (NASDAQ:ASV) as the critical indicator of the sales pipeline and long-term revenue growth. 2019 ending ASV growth was 5.1%; 2020 guidance going into Q3 earnings was ~4%. Among the company's Q3 guidance changes was an upward change to ASV projections for 2020, tweaking their outlook up to ~4.5% - part of the positive story met with glee by the market. When asked about 2021 expectations, however, management was silent. No guidance has been given to the market on what FactSet thinks growth will look like past fiscal Q4 of this year, ending in August. The only commentary management gave was that they're talking with their biggest customers - large banks and buy-side institutions - and will know more in August during their next earnings call.Meanwhile, FactSet's customers have been dealing with problems of their own amid the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic fallout. Originally planning to enact layoffs throughout 2020, banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, and others decided to put these plans on hold during the pandemic as a show of goodwill amid massive uncertainty:(Source: CNBC, Reuters, American Banker)The message we're starting to see more clearly as the pandemic wears on, however, is that these layoffs are paused, not cancelled - we're already starting to see banks revive some layoff plans and give more clear signals of what's to come in 2021:(Source: Bloomberg, Forbes, ABC)What's more, the Federal Reserve chose to restrict buybacks and limit dividend payments at the large banks after stress test results showed some banks would drop to minimum capital thresholds in the event of a double-dip recession due to coronavirus:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Whether it be pressure from regulators, economic shocks due to coronavirus, or the long-term threat of low interest rates, banks are facing multiple headwinds right now and are reacting with plans for lower headcount in 2021.This bleak outlook for FactSet's customer base reverberates back to the company in the form of a smaller paying user base for its services and lower client counts. I think it will be very difficult for FactSet to sidestep the challenging omens coming from its largest customers, which will reveal itself when FDS gives 2021 guidance in three months' time.On top of this, we saw an 8-K filing by FactSet in early June that it had parted ways with its global head of sales, Franck A.R. Gossieaux, after only 1 year in the role. While not on its own indicative of underlying weakness, it does add to potential concerns about the sales pipeline when the company's head of sales role is vacant.It is difficult to maintain a negative view of a company whose shares have just blasted through all-time highs after beating earnings estimates. However, after looking through the numbers and considering the forward outlook, I think a substantial amount of risk remains with FactSet and urge investors to be cautious. Earnings beat estimates on lower expenses due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, along with a large non-GAAP adjustment I think is debatable. The company hasn't given sales guidance for 2021 against the backdrop of large potential layoffs at its top clients, which I think carries meaningful risk.At the end of the day, an incredible amount of uncertainty remains among FactSet's management team, client base, and in the macro environment as a whole. No one truly knows what 2021 will look like in the wake of an unprecedented pandemic and a deep recession - including me. Could banks decide to cancel layoffs? Absolutely. Could FactSet's sales team succeed without a head of sales? 100%. I'm not willing to take the risk, however, of owning FactSet at all-time high prices and at ~33x 2020 EPS and ~32x 2021 EPS. Too much has to go right from here for the stock to have meaningful upside, and I'm looking elsewhere for a better place to put my money.Data by YChartsIf you liked this article and want more analysis of the market data & exchange industry, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button at the top of this page.

The company aggregates various market data, financial statement information, and relevant news sources into its platform that is used for portfolio management analytics targeted at institutional clients. The stock is up over 360% in the past decade on a total return basis supported by a consolidating market share and an evolving product offering. This year, FDS has exhibited more volatility with concerns over operational momentum and a weaker earnings outlook. This article takes a look at the latest quarterly report and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: Finviz.com)FactSet Research Systems reported its 2020 Q1 earnings on December 19th with non-GAAP EPS of $2.58 and GAAP EPS of $2.43 which both beat estimates by $0.16 and $0.24 each respectively. Revenue of $366.66 million was up 4.3% year over year, but slightly below estimates.The story this quarter was a continuation of the trend for the past year which has been more muted top-line growth, while earnings have accelerated. GAAP EPS this quarter increased by 12% y/y compared to organic revenue growth of 4.2%. An effort at cost controls coupled with the benefit of higher pricing and revenue-mix has driven an expansion of the adjusted operating margin to 33.9% from 31.5% in the period last year, a positive improvement of 240 basis points. Free cash flow of $69.0 million in the quarter was up from $36.7 million in Q1 2019.(Source: Company IR/ highlights by author)In terms of operating metrics, the company noted a growth in total user count at 126,785, up 10% year over year. Client count of 5,601, including those with revenues over $10,000 per year, increased by 5.8% from the period in fiscal 2019, although the overall client retention ratio at 89% dipped by 200 basis points compared to 2019.Highlights from the conference call include what the company sees as positive momentum in trading products and services with the integration ""OMS"" and ""EMS"" on its platform. Essentially, ""order"" and ""execution management systems"" are now integrated with portfolio management tools. These efforts go towards the direction of what market leader and privately held Bloomberg L.P. offers with the industry-leading Bloomberg terminal implying the FactSet is targeting a greater share of that market.For the full year, management sees revenues right around $1.5 billion, an increase of 4.5% compared to the 2019 result. Adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $9.85 and $10.15, essentially flat compared to the fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS result of $10.00. Adjusted operating margin in a range between 31.5% and 32.5% is below the latest Q1 result. FactSet signed a major contract with Bank of America Merrill Lynch for wealth management products back in 2018 which the company sees may create some difficult comps for the upcoming quarter compared to the ramp up period in 2019. The expectation is that investments in content and technology could pressure earnings in the near term, while there would be upside longer term.(Source: Company IR)Looking ahead, the market remains bullish on share seeing 2020 EPS at $10.02 at the upper range of management target. For 2021, the market estimates FactSet can reach EPS of $10.56 and $11.49. This implies a 5.4% increase in EPS for fiscal 2021, which could rebound to 8.8% in fiscal 2022. Revenue is expected to remain under 5% per year through fiscal 2022.Data by YChartsWe are familiar with the FactSet platform and have an overall positive opinion of the product as a tool for investment research. The company's strong growth over the past decade can be attributed to the constant evolution of its offering, constantly evolving to meet the needs of the market. In this regard, we expect FactSet to be a major player in the industry and continue to consolidate its market share for the foreseeable future.That being said, our concern here turns to the stock's current valuation that remains relatively expensive or pricey in our view. We're looking at a current forward P/E multiple of 26.6x based on full-year 2020 consensus estimates compared to a 10-year average P/E of 25.8x. This is in the context of what is a more muted earnings growth outlook in the near-term considering management guidance for flat EPS growth in 2020.Data by YChartsOften times, it's justifiable for a stock to command a higher growth premium with an acceleration of the top line or margin expansion, but in this case FactSet's operating and financial momentum is moderating compared what the company achieved over in recent years. By this measure, we'd like to see the P/E ratio lower implying the stock price would need to be lower to present a compelling buying opportunity. Free cash flow has been strong point for the company reaching $69 million in fiscal Q1, or ~$400 million over the past year. The stock's price to free cash flow ratio at 25.8x, as with the P/E ratio, is also slightly higher than the long-term ratio average.Data by YChartsRecognizing what is a solid company with a leadership position in financial market data services, we believe the business and market has matured to the point where the company will be challenged to significantly improve growth rates from current levels. We rate shares of FDS as a hold, without a clear catalyst for upside beyond what is already priced into the stock and the weaker trends. While there is no reason to expect a major sell-off in shares, risks include exposure to global cyclical trends while investors should continue to monitor financial margins."

The company operates with high margins. The profit margin is 24% with a return on equity of over 50%. However, in recent years FactSet’s debt has shown an increasing trend. Prior to the 2015/08 fiscal year, the company’s total liabilities represented only 20% of its total asset value. Since 2015 this has steadily increased to 60%. While this is level not excessive, I personally don’t like increasing debt trends as they can cause financial problems if they continue to escalate.FactSet’s 2021 forward PE multiple is 24.5x with a stock price of $260 and its trailing PE multiple is 28.7x. The company’s book value multiple is 14.7x.The chart below visually shows FactSet’s revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts.FactSet data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, FactSet’s revenue has steadily increased and the company’s earnings have also shown a strong increasing trend. The forecasts indicate that the company’s revenue and earnings are expected to continue higher through to the 2021/08 fiscal year.Over the last decade, FactSet’s revenue has increased at an average rate of 9.4% per year and its earnings have increased at an average rate of 12.2% per year. The forecasts indicate that the company’s growth is expected to slow considerably with revenue growth of 4% and earnings growth of 6%.FactSet provides financial information and analytical applications to investment professionals like portfolio managers, research analysts and investment professionals. The company provides its services across the United States, Europe and Asia. Based on the 2019 fiscal year, FactSet’s derived most of its revenue from the United States with 62%. Europe generated 29% and Asia the remaining 9%. As a provider of investment services, this means that FactSet’s growth is heavily dependant on the performance of the United States stock markets like the NYSE and NASDAQ.FactSet’s growth has been boosted with several acquisitions in recent years.In September 2016, FactSet completed the acquisition of CYMBA Technologies, a U.K. company with a core order management system.In November 2016, FactSet acquired Vermilion Software, a global provider of client reporting and communications software.In March 2016, FactSet acquired BISAM, a global provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications.In April 2017, FactSet completed its acquisition of Interactive Data Managed Solutions. The acquisition expanded FactSet’s solutions for the wealth management industry.FactSet has a solid history of growth as is evident with the above revenue and earnings chart. FactSet’s CEO Phil Snow has made a point of this on the company’s website and in their latest earnings call,The CEO further commented,FactSet’s business operations are split into four categories - Research Solutions, Analytics Solutions, Wealth Solutions, and Content and Technology Solutions.The CEO stated that all four businesses grew year-over-year, with Analytics Solutions being the largest growth contributor.For the most part I think that the company is well managed. The profit margins are high and so is the return on equity. While these high returns are partially due to FactSet operating in a service industry (which tend to operate with higher margins), the growth over the past decade has nevertheless been strong and consistent.The raising debt level in recent years is something that I don’t like to see. For the five years prior to 2015, the company was conservatively financed with its total liabilities averaging only 20% of its asset value, but this has steadily increased to the present 60%. While 60% is not that high, if management allows this trend to continue the debt could approach 100% in a few years and this is something that investors don’t like to see.FactSet operates in the financial information industry which includes some large competitors such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Some of the other competitors with competitive products include Morningstar and BlackRock Solutions.While competition is normal for businesses, it can also set up pricing wars as competitors attempt to increase their market share. This naturally leads to lower profits, but for FactSet’s raising debt trend this could cause problems as it reduces cash flow which negatively impacts on it short-term finances (working capital). The risk here is that FactSet might not be able to sustain a prolonged price war.Even though FactSet’s debt continues to increase, the company continues with its share repurchase program. For the 2019 fiscal year the company repurchased shares worth $220. In 2018 the company repurchased $304 million and in 2017 repurchased $261 million worth of shares.FactSet also continues with its dividend program (much to the delight of shareholders). The company paid $100 million in dividends for the 2019 fiscal year with a yield of around 1.0%. FactSet also paid dividends of $89 million in 2018 and $81 million in 2017.Personally, I think that the company should pay down its debt first before paying dividends and repurchasing shares, but the reality is that this could make investors unhappy which could see the stock price plunge.FactSet has a history of strong growth with its earnings increasing at 12.2% per year over the last decade. The company’s growth is expected to slow to 6% which gives a forward PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) of 4.1 with a 2021/08 PE multiple of 24.5x.A forward PEG of 4.1 is well above the 1.5 to 2.5 range that’s typical for growth stocks. Considering the company’s increasing debt trend and the lower excepted future growth, I think this makes the stock very expensive at current prices.As an active investor I personally like to view stock charts so that I can see whether the stock has been responding to its fundamentals.FactSet Warehouse chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade FactSet’s stock price has trended higher with a sequence of rallies and minor pullbacks with the upward trend essentially following the company's growth. The stock even managed to hold its ground during the 2018 market decline and produced a strong rally this year, having almost reached $300 before pulling back.FactSet’s certainly appears to be a market favorite, but I suspect that the stock’s strength has more to do with speculative investors and traders fueling the strong uptrend. Over the last decade FactSet’s earnings increased 180%, but its stock price has increased 350%.The stock is becoming very expensive with a forward PEG of 4.1 and to make things worse the company’s debt continues to increase while its growth is expected to slow.Investors may be able to justify the fairly PE ratio while earnings grow at 12%, but if the earnings growth rate does drop to the expected 6% then this will make the stock price very expensive.Raising debt and slowing growth is not a good combination for investor confidence and this would likely see investors’ bailout and traders lose interest in the stock. I think these two factors combined with a high valuation makes the stock vulnerable to a significant price correction.In the short term the stock will probably continue along with its decade long uptrend, but over the longer term I would be cautious if I owned the stock.FactSet has a solid track record of revenue and earnings growth. FactSet operates profitably with high profits margins and high returns on equity, but its debt continues to increase.Despite the rising debt, the company has chosen to continue paying dividends and repurchase shares instead of using this money to help pay down its debt. I think this is a tactic by management to keep investors happy so they don't bailout, which will help the stock sustain its strong share price gains.Considering the company’s forecast growth is expected to slow considerably, I think that the stock is a very expensive with a forward PEG of 4.1 and a forward PE of 24.5x. While I think that FactSet’s strong stock price trend would likely continue in the short-term, in the longer term I think the stock is vulnerable to a significant price correction, so I’m on the sidelines."
4283607,104952,2019-08-08T22:11:17-04:00,"FactSet's solid product, fundamentals, and financial performance provide a strong investment opportunity for both technology and income investors.In Q3, FactSet's EPS grew by almost 24% YoY, making its full 2019 fiscal year EPS guidance of $9.8 - $9.9 seem conservative.With a retention rate of 95%+, 12.5% DPS growth, and average net profit margin of 20%, FactSet is a strong and steady business.","Being the smaller one among its competitors such as Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters (TRI), we think that FactSet (FDS) presents a very interesting investment opportunity given its very strong product, business fundamentals, and financial performance to-date. One thing that we like in particular about FactSet is its core product, where its flexibility and specialty has allowed FactSet to both cross-sell and provide a stronger niche offering for a more specialized type of users such as wealth manager and data scientists, outside the traditional users such as portfolio managers or equity researchers.(Source: Seeking Alpha. FactSet’s EPS estimation vs actual)So far, FactSet has had a very strong year. After 3 quarters of solid EPS beats combined with a very exceptional Q3 2019 performance where its EPS grew by 24% YoY, we think that it would be quite likely for FactSet to outdo the analysts’ projected annual revenue of $1.43 billion at the end of August, which is the end of its fiscal year for 2019. The relatively more conservative performance guidance would bring its annual revenue growth rate to 5.9% YoY, slightly lower than its 6.4% Trailing Annual.(Source: Stockrow. FactSet Dividend per share)Another reason why a lot of mainstream and income investors choose FactSet is due to its dividend and shares buyback policy. Over the last few years, FactSet has maintained a steady 12.5% DPS YoY growth, which in its case creates further confidence in the stock resulting in a strong price per share performance.As we have mentioned briefly, we think that FactSet’s strength is in the modularity of its product. Compared to an older generation financial data provider such as Bloomberg, FactSet’s array of products and services can cater to different audiences such as wealth managers, risk analysts, or investment researchers separately as standalone products. Indeed, learning from its superior Q3 performance report, 5.6% of its ASV (Annual Subscription Value) was driven primarily by a strong sales performance of its wealth and analytics products. A stronger ASV means a stronger future revenue, given ASV records the value of the total subscription amount for the next twelve months of its users.(Source: Seeking Alpha. FDS Q3 2019 Earnings Call)We think that its ability to gradually improve its product offerings across each particular use case has contributed a lot to its very strong retention rate in terms of ASV. From the first time we researched FactSet in 2016 until today, we found that its retention rate has never fallen below 95% - 97%. The modularity, as it turns out, also helps in generating marginal ASV through cross-selling within any particular user's organization and providing strategic options when penetrating a new market.The greatest risk for a company like FactSet is a systemic disruption where, for instance, the cost of real-time financial data becomes much cheaper and there exist more services with a greater value proposition for some users that FactSet caters to. In that context, we have seen up-and-coming niche competitors such as Intrinio or Quandl catering to developers with better API (Application Programming Interface) services which are getting increasingly popular. That being said, it would actually have been a greater risk for FactSet’s older competitors like Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters, whose terminals cost around $2,000 per month.Given the fact that financial data business is quite a concentrated market with a relatively high barrier to entry due to the client relationships, we think that FactSet’s controlled growth strategy by focusing on organic cross-selling and products/services diversification also limits its risk. In addition, having a relatively smaller size and a more modular business model further ultimately allows FactSet to react faster to any potential disruption which could result in a major change in any of its markets.FactSet has a P/E ratio that is twice as high as its peers'. We believe that much of the premium is driven by its recurring and sticky income stream, product strength, and its dividend and share buyback policies.(Source: Seeking Alpha. P/E ratios of FactSet vs. Sector median)For the FY 2019 fiscal period, we can expect that FactSet will finish the year with an EPS of $9.8 - $9.9, which roughly means that it can target a 27.87 P/E ratio after a solid Q3 beat. The EPS guidance has been raised from previously $9.50-9.65 with an EPS estimate of $9.61. For the long term, we feel that FactSet's strong fundamentals and optimistic outlook provide a conviction that the stock will maintain its performance in the future. In shorter term, there is a high possibility that with its strong EPS guidance for the rest of FY 2019, we will probably see FactSet trading close to its all-time-high again at $301 per share, which is a 9.5% premium to its current price per share of $274. In both cases, we feel that FactSet is a great addition to any portfolio today.From a financial perspective, we think that FactSet is a very interesting opportunity for technology investors. Its careful growth strategy has allowed FactSet to invest wisely across its product offerings and to maintain a solid profitability and liquidity. In the process, it also allows FactSet to return some of its earnings to the shareholders, creating a broader appeal for the stock.(Source: Seeking Alpha. FactSet Q3 2019 earnings slide)In addition to technology investors, we think that income investors would also be very keen to tap into the steady stream of YoY 29% to 30% payout ratio, $0.72 DPS, and over $250 million to $300 million total share repurchases annually that FactSet offers. Given its shareholder-friendly policies and its solid income growth through flexible product offerings, we think that FactSet provides a unique upside for investors looking for the best of both worlds."
4255806,50662,2019-04-27T11:10:00-04:00,"Factset's low capex business is generating a lot of free cash flow.Further growth inside the niche is difficult, so the majority of the free cash flow is spent on dividends and share buybacks.The share count decreases slowly due to employees exercising their in-the-money stock options.","In an article I wrote about FactSet Data Research (FDS) in July 2016, I was in awe of the performance of the company as its capital allocation was mainly focusing on dividends and share repurchases. As Factset was (and still is) operating in a low capex sector, the majority of its incoming cash flow could easily be deployed toward shareholder-friendly measures.Factset seems to be on track for another great year as its revenue (and net income) just continues to increase. In the second quarter of its financial year (which ends in August), Factset’s revenue increased by almost 6% to $355M, and what’s really impressive is to see pretty much the entire revenue growth was driven by organic growth.The good performance in the second quarter pushed the total revenue in the first semester to almost $707M, a 6.3% increase. Unfortunately Factset also had to deal with higher operating expenses (which is just normal), but these expenses increased at a much slower pace than revenue: During the first six months of the financial year, those expenses increased at just half the pace of the revenue increase. That’s the main reason why Factset’s operating income increased by a very robust 13.3%.As the company has been buying back more stock (which is its preferred way of spending the incoming free cash flow – see later), the higher interest rates had a negative impact on Factset as its interest expenses increased in excess of 40% to almost $9M. That’s still fine, as this indicates the cost of debt is still lower than 3% (which is an important parameter to determine whether a company is better off buying back stock or reducing its net debt).Source: SEC filingsThe new US corporate tax rates are also now kicking in (although the new tax law was established at the end of 2017, Factset was still ""phasing in"" the adjusted corporate tax rates and did report an average tax pressure of 30.8% in the first half of last year). This has now dropped to just below 16% as the average tax rate on pre-tax income in the first half of the current financial year. This very likely is a one-off event, and Factset refers to R&D tax benefits as well as additional tax breaks related to the share-based payments to its staff.The bottom line? Net income of $169M, or $4.44 per share. Keep in mind this is based on an average share count of 38.08M shares, but as of the end of March, the share count had increased to 38.24 million shares (very likely on the back of option exercises or the vesting of share-based payments in the form of restricted share units).The excellent performance was also clearly visible in Factset’s cash flow statements: The reported operating cash flow was a very respectable $145.6M, but after taking the relatively high investments in the working capital position into consideration, the adjusted operating cash flow in the first semester was approximately $215M.Source: SEC filingsThe total capex in the first semester was $21.5M, and although this is almost twice as much as in the comparable period in the preceding year, the capex level is still at a ratio of just 75% of the depreciation charges (which exceeded $29M in H1 2019). The calculation is pretty simple: $215M - $21.5M = $193.5M in adjusted free cash flow. Divided by the 38.24M outstanding shares results in a free cash flow of just over $5.05 per share. Factset should be on track to report a full-year free cash flow of $6 per share.A very healthy amount of free cash flow, and Factset lets its shareholders participate in its success. The dividend is relatively low (the dividend was set at $0.64 at the February board meeting, which means Factset’s annual dividend is $2.56/share for a dividend yield of approximately 1%), so the cash outflow related to the dividend remains relatively low ($2.56 X 38.24M shares = $98M).Considering Factset will generate approximately four times as much in free cash flow during the year, it has approximately $250-300M of cash to spend on other things than the dividend.Unfortunately Factset is operating in a niche market (perhaps that’s actually a positive feature as the barriers to entry for potential new entrants are relatively high due to the established positions of the current players), so spending the money on acquiring other companies isn’t a realistic option. And as I’d prefer Factset to not ""wander off"" into other sectors by pursuing ambitious targets ""to diversify,"" the best option is to spend the excess cash flow on share buybacks which also compensates for the share based payments.Source: SEC filingsIn the first half of the current financial year, Factset has spent $110.7M on share repurchases (a net amount of $67M after taking the proceeds from option exercises into account). Despite this relatively sizable investment, Factset only repurchased a net amount of 92,000 shares as it repurchased 518,000 shares but also had to issue 426,000 new shares due to the option exercises (indicating the average exercise price of the employee options was around $100/share). So in a way, the share repurchases are necessary to avoid the share count spiraling out of control. And Factset is doing a good job by keeping an eye on the total net dilution.Factset has always been a robust and resilient performer and the company seems to be on track to report a full-year free cash flow result of in excess of $10 per share. This means I probably wouldn’t want to buy the stock at in excess of $260/share (indicating a free cash flow yield of less than 4%), but not having a position is my own fault. Back in December 2018, the entire world economy appeared to go downhill and we encountered a massive correction on the stock markets. I did focus on other companies whose share prices also got hit and lost track of Factset.Rien à faire, as the French would say, but I will most definitely consider a long position at the next correction to take advantage of the opportunity."

The California Gold Rush of 1849 is one of those turning points – thousands of prospective gold miners traveled west in search of riches, more than 750,000 lbs of gold was discovered in the ensuing years, and the mass-migration helped expedite California’s entry to the Union amid rising political and cultural tensions leading up to the Civil War.People took advantage of the gold rush in multiple ways, prompting the above famous quote from Mark Twain; while many miners became rich discovering gold, others grew profitable businesses supporting the miners in their search for treasure, like selling shovels, land and other needed tools for exploration and mining.In today’s markets, I like to think of Factset as a modern day shovel business. FDS is a market data & analytics provider to the asset management and broader financial services industry (the “49ers” of our time), serving over 5,500 clients and 128,000 users globally as of February 2020. Factset operates a subscription business model with annual subscription value (NASDAQ:ASV) of ~$1.5 billion, split among 4 distinct product groups:(Source: FDS Q4 2019 Earnings Presentation)Research (43% of ASV): Factset’s core business revolves around collecting, consolidating, and distributing valuable financial data from over 1,000 sources through its platform, allowing customers to discover and act on trading & investing opportunities. Client mix skews towards the buy side as those with actively-focused funds and AUM rely more on market data to pursue alpha (more on this later):(Source: FDS 10-K Filings)Analytics (35% of ASV): Factset also provides middle and back-office solutions for portfolio managers, including advanced portfolio analytics, risk management services, and integrated order execution. FDS management describes this business as simply reducing the busy-work & low-complexity tasks a PM and trader need to focus on throughout the trading day, allowing funds to give more time to investing strategy and the more complex aspects of portfolio management.Content and Tech Solutions (NYSE:CTS) (11% of ASV): This segment comprises Factsets’ growing feeds services, allowing customers to receive data in custom formats tailored to their trading & investing strategies. As more institutional traders adopt algorithmic trading and automate more of their business, Factset’s API feeds allow these clients to integrate data into their strategies with much greater speed and efficiency.Wealth (10% of ASV): In addition to the products above built for the institutional asset management industry, Factset has also tailored its market data & portfolio analytics products for the wealth advisory industry. As competition in this business heats up, wealth managers are increasingly looking to advanced analytics & automation to pitch a better value proposition to clients and add efficiency to their operations.Below shows the ASV growth rates for Factset’s 4 product groups over the last few years – Research’s slow growth boosted by the other segments:(Source: FDS Investor Relations)Factset’s unique product combinations and growing salesforce has allowed it to capitalize on an buy side gold rush since the financial crisis – as more funds embraced technology change and demand for market data and automation increased, Factset was able to sell more and more shovels to eager gold miners.

Management highlighted a difficult operating environment among its customer base and a greater focus on cost-cutting, including market data spend.

Below is a chart from S&P Global showing just how intense the active management outflows have been:(Source: S&P Global 2019 Investor Factbook)The above chart has a rather straightforward impact for Factset – if there are less active funds and AUM in the marketplace today, Factset’s addressable market shrinks. Because passive funds follow a pre-defined set of rules and index to external benchmarks, there is no need to search for investment opportunities and execute complex trades every day, reducing the attractiveness of Factset’s offerings. Factset even calls this risk out in its 10-K:(Source: FDS 2019 10-K Filing)All signs point to this active-to-passive risk clearly playing out over the last few years, with expectations that it will continue to play out – if not accelerate – in the future.The above says it all – Factset revealed a 2020 slowdown to the market amid the passive boom and cost-cutting among buy side clients, before COVID-19 hit. Fast-forward to Factset’s quarter ending February 2020, and management had additional commentary around changes to the outlook as a result of the virus:(Source: FDS Q2 2020 Earnings Transcript)Along with this new language warning investors about the rest of 2020 and 2021, the company also lowered its guidance for ASV growth in 2020, from $65M - $85M of growth (~5% growth at the midpoint) down to $50M - $75M of growth (~4% growth at the midpoint).What’s interesting to me about this guidance change is the company did not lower overall revenue guidance, despite the forecasted slowdown in ASV. While Factset does have a recurring, subscription-based model that protects against wild short-term swings in revenue, there is a direct relationship between ASV growth and revenue growth over time. This leads me to believe there is a heightened chance the company comes in at the lower end of its revenue guidance or misses it altogether, and if expenses aren’t cut in tandem with revenue, EPS ranges could be impacted as well. The buy side environment has not improved amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and global deflationary pressures almost certainly equate to continued cost-cutting measures enacted by these funds, hurting Factset further.While I believe a compelling bearish (or at least anti-bullish) thesis exists for Factset today, there are factors that could cause the story to improve. One such factor is the “V-shaped recovery” many are betting on and hoping for; if the economy snaps back once coronavirus is behind us, buy side investment spending should see some recovery as well, meaning Factset sales will improve with it. There are also increasingly louder rumblings of a “passive bubble” in stocks, with markets being pushed higher by 401Ks and index funds that hold close to 0% cash and buy stocks with new inflows no matter the price or valuation. If the passive-investing craze reverses itself or changes in the future, Factset could capitalize on a new buy side gold rush in the coming years as active management rebounds in popularity.However, I don’t think these events are likely to happen in the near future, if at all. COVID-19 is sure to hang over the markets & economy at least through 2020, and passive investing inflows are showing no sign of slowing down anytime soon.When taking all the data points above into account, it becomes increasingly difficult for a bullish Factset thesis to pass muster. The company is benefitting from increased demand for market data & automation, but those benefits are being overshadowed by massive transition into passive investing and coronavirus-induced cost cutting by many of its buy & sell side clients. At the end of 2019, FDS guided to flat EPS growth in 2020, but did not adjust this down further even after taking ASV guidance down in March. If coronavirus keeps the global economy locked down through Q2 and into Q3, I think this guidance could come down further, and we could see more pressure on the stock. Factset is currently trading at ~28x 2020’s EPS estimate of $10 per share, which I think is too high a multiple for 0% growth in earnings this year. I think money would be better served elsewhere at this time, or in cash waiting for better opportunities.If you liked this article and want more analysis of the market data & exchange industry, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button at the top of this page.

At 27x trailing PE, Mr. Market isn't offering FDS cheaply on earnings. Furthermore, we think competitive products are catching up, and FDS could be at risk of either share loss or pricing pressures. The recent market downturn has also heightened the threat of budget cuts which could weigh quite heavily on FDS going forward.

4258389,95006,2019-05-01T04:55:19-04:00,"This analysis of FactSet stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It analyzes expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean, earnings growth, and business returns that weight returns to shareholders more heavily.The analysis also examines the potential opportunity cost of waiting for a better price for the stock.","SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of highly cyclical stocks. When dealing with highly cyclical stocks, it's usually a good idea to evaluate potential returns over a relatively short 5-year time frame, because the stock prices can move dramatically over short periods of time. Investing in these types of stocks requires techniques that are different from the standard analysis most investors use to evaluate a stock. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical"", they are still usually subject to the short-term debt cycle (or business cycle) and to changes in sentiment (which can sometimes also have a cyclical quality about it). More recently, I have been adapting some of the techniques I've used with ""classic cyclicals"" so that I can apply them to less-cyclical stocks. And today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions that I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two, unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes. It just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest, I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main difference you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual rate of growth (CARG) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I weight shareholder yields from dividends (and potentially from buybacks) more heavily because that is money actually being returned to shareholders; 5) I provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is not currently a ""buy"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is the stock will trade low enough to become a ""buy"" over the next 4-5 years if we have a recession.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the three main drivers of future total returns: 1) Market Sentiment Returns, 2) Full-Cycle Organic Earnings Growth Returns, and 3) Shareholder-Weighted Business Returns. Then, I combine all three 10-year CARG estimates together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CARG estimate. Currently, I consider an expected CARG > 15% a ""buy"", 12-15% an ""outperform"", 8-12% a ""market perform"", 4-8% an ""underperform"", and < 4% a ""sell"".With that, let's get into the analysis.When dealing with stocks whose earnings are not very cyclical or economically sensitive, using long-term P/E ratios can be useful for gauging market sentiment. Let's take a look at FactSet Research Systems (FDS) using a F.A.S.T. Graph (which is a great tool for this sort of analysis) to see how cyclical earnings have historically been:In order to guide which sort of analysis I'll perform, I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth"". This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low"", ""moderate"", and ""high"". ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much farther than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last, but not least, are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns, but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical"".For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.In terms of earnings cyclicality, FactSet falls in the ""secular growth"" category. It hasn't had a single year of earnings declines over the past two decades. That's very impressive. For stocks with this sort of history, it is appropriate to use a 10-year time frame to estimate future returns, because under most circumstances, the stock price is unlikely to have big drawdowns of -30% or more, unless we are in an economic recession - and those typically occur once a decade.Now, I want to take a look at what sort of returns we might expect 10 years from now if FactSet's P/E ratio were to trade at its average from the last cycle. I roughly estimate the point we are in the current cycle to be similar to where we were in 2006 during the last cycle, so that's the time frame I'm going to examine in the next F.A.S.T. Graph:We can see that currently, FactSet trades at a blended P/E ratio of 29.4, and the normal P/E ratio this cycle has been about 25.1. If FactSet were to revert to a 25.1 P/E ratio 10 years from now, it would produce a CARG of about -1.57%.If we begin our measurement around the same point we were at last cycle, which I estimate to be about 2006, and we adjust the annually compounded EPS growth for the amount of stock that was repurchased over this time period, we can estimate how much CARG we can expect over the next 10 years if the next cycle is similar to the previous one.Data by YChartsOver the past cycle, FactSet has steadily bought back about 21.44% of the outstanding shares of the company. I will take the effects of these buybacks out when calculating the expected earnings growth over the next 10 years, and I will also assume that we will have a recession at some point over the next 10 years as well.When I run the numbers on that, if the next cycle is similar to the previous one, we would expect an organic earnings CARG of about +7.16% over the next 10 years from earnings growth.These return estimates are more complicated than the first two, but the idea behind this is to figure out how much the company is making in cash and/or earnings per share while taking into account debt and cash levels, how much of a dividend yield it is paying to shareholders, what percentage of shares it is buying back annually, and how much cash the company is keeping for itself, all on a per share basis. Once that is complete, I assume any money the business keeps for itself will accrue over a 10-year time period, but I don't assume that it will compound (since I estimated the earnings growth in the last section). For buybacks, if the company is buying back shares when sentiment is below average, I will assume the value of the buybacks will compound over time. If they are buying back when sentiment is higher than average, I will assume the buybacks accrue but do not compound value over the 10-year time period. (This is just a way to weight the value of buybacks over time for the estimate, it isn't intended to be mathematically precise - which is fine for me, because we never know exactly what price the buybacks will be made over time anyway, so there's no sense in pretending we do.) I will assume that dividends paid to shareholders compound their value over time, because shareholders can immediately reinvest the dividends in the best investment available.As I noted, this process is intended to estimate how much money the business is likely to make and how much of that money will likely be returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I limit the expectation of shareholder returns by how much cash is currently being generated and the company's apparent intention of investing that cash itself or returning it to shareholders. If buybacks and dividends are more than cash flows and earnings, I will assume they are unsustainable through a full cycle that includes a recession, and I limit the shareholder return expectations to actual cash flows and/or earnings estimates I think are reasonable.First, let's revisit those buybacks and see what sort of returns we might expect from them in the future. I'll look at both the 1-year and 3-year time frames.Data by YChartsData by YChartsLooking at the 1-, 3-, and 12-year buyback trend, I'm going to assume FactSet will buy back about 1.75% of shares per year over the next 10 years.Data by YChartsCurrently, we can expect a +0.94% dividend yield going forward.In order to see if buybacks and dividends are sustainable over the next cycle, I like to take a look at both earnings yield and free cash flow-to-equity/enterprise value yield to make sure the company has the income to sustain the buybacks and dividends, and also to see how much is left for the company to invest in its business.Data by YChartsThe earnings yield looks like it is enough to cover both the dividends and expected buybacks.Data by YChartsFCFE/EV yield is about 3.6% right now, and that is also enough to cover buyback and dividend expectations.When I run the numbers on this, with buybacks accruing, but not compounding over the next 10 years (along with the excess cash the business keeps for itself), and assume that the dividends will compound over the next 10 years, I get a 10-year expected business return of+2.92% CARG over the next 10 years.Putting all three - market sentiment returns (-1.57%), earnings growth returns (+7.16%), and business/shareholder returns (+2.92%) - together, I estimate a full-cycle 10-year CARG return of +8.51%. That falls in the ""market perform"" category for me. During the trough of the December correction, FactSet would have just gotten into the ""outperform"" category. I think there is a good chance this stock could trade at attractive levels if we have a correction that is a little deeper, and I would be very interested in buying this one if the price were right.Next, let's examine what my chances are of purchasing the stock at a lower price if we are to have a recession within the next 5 years.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graph's forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. Then, I assume we will have a recession after that point. What I want to know is if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy FactSet at a significantly lower price than it trades today, or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.If we hold FactSet's current P/E ratio steady over the next 2-3 years, analysts are currently projecting that, including dividends, we will see a price of $346.32. During the past two recessions, we saw price declines of about -50% off the highs. If that same decline begins in about 2-3 years, we could ultimately see a price of $173.16. That is quite a bit lower than the $271.12 we have today. At the peak before the last recession, FactSet traded at a little bit higher P/E of around 33 (about 10% higher than today), so it's possible if the stock goes into the next recession with a lower P/E than last time, it might fall a little less than -50% off its highs - but it looks like there is little risk in missing out on a good price for FactSet if we see an economic slowdown within the next 3 years.With very consistent earnings and growth, and just enough price cyclicality to provide good buying opportunities, FactSet looks like a quality opportunity during periods of economic weakness. I'll be placing this stock on my watchlist and take another look at it if the price declines more than -30% off its highs at some point in the future. For current shareholders, I see no reason to sell the stock right now, but they should be aware that a potential drawdown during a recession could be fairly deep relative to FactSet's remarkably consistent earnings."

As of the latest quarter, the company served, in total, 122k+ users (i.e., individuals accessing FactSet services across all client sites) and 5.4k+ clients (i.e., companies subscribing to FactSet services with an Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, greater than $10,000).FactSet primarily derives its revenue from subscriptions to products and professional services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data, research management, and trade execution. This business model is attractive from multiple perspectives - it provides highly predictable sales streams, strong cash generation, economic moat, and high scalability. The management appears to focus a lot on the ASV number, which represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients, and hence, could be a good indicator of generated business value and near-term growth momentum. Thanks to the 95% client retention rate, ASV also sheds the light on long-term visibility for investors. As you can see below, the total ASV climbed steadily YoY for the past few years.Source: 2018 Annual ReportThe recurring revenue model at FactSet enables the company to grow its revenue and cash flow smoothly even during the Financial Crisis (see below).Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/26/2019.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/26/2019.At the same time, the solid business model also supported the dividend growth at a consistent pace since the payout started (see below).Source: YCharts; data as of 9/26/2019.It is worth noting that, per the chart below, FactSet generated more FCF than net profits in most of the years for the past decade, thanks to, again, the subscription business model that requires prepayment. Such strong cash generation has earned the company additional capability and flexibility to invest for the long run.Source: YCharts; data as of 9/26/2019.The financial information services industry is highly competitive, with big players, such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv (being acquired by London Stock Exchange Group (OTCPK:LDNXF) (OTCPK:LNSTY)), Morningstar (MORN), MSCI (MSCI), S&P Global (SPGI).Source: Owler, data as of 9/26/2019.While FactSet does not possess the ""size advantage"" compared to its peers, the business did consistently outperform in terms of returns on invested capital and FCF returns on total assets, per the charts below.Source: YCharts; data as of 9/26/2019.Source: YCharts; data as of 9/26/2019.In the meantime, the annual returns on tangible assets improved steadily from 20% in 2003 to almost 50% this year.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/26/2019.As a result, it is highly suggested that the economic moat exists for FactSet to protect its cash-rich and capital-efficient business.In our opinion, the company's sustainable competitive advantages largely come from its growing installed base with high switching cost as well as the scale in an industry with some barriers to entry.The breadth and depth of FactSet's applications with flexible modularity and high specialty would make the clients unwilling to spend time on system integration and staff training even if a slightly better and cheaper solution emerges. It is common to see FactSet's data/service integration with various financial models in the investment community.As mentioned earlier, the industry is concentrated with a bunch of major platforms with a comprehensive spectrum of functions and data. It would take enormous capital and time for a new entrant to build a comparable platform.Although FactSet has a solid business model to generate reliable cash flow and fend off competition, it should be realized that it may be hard for most offerings in this space to significantly differentiate from each other. This could clog organic growth and/or lead to margin pressure.Typically, the company retains two-thirds of its annual earnings to widen its economic moat and drive long-term growth.In terms of the latest quarter, the majority of FactSet's sales were generated in the Americas. Only less than 10% of its organic ASV is from the APAC but with double-digit YoY growth (see below). The region is expected to see a 9% annual increase through 2025 in the buy-side space, which could be another long-term driver for FactSet's international expansion.Source: Earnings Call Presentation, Q3 2019.Relying on organic growth only, we would expect the company to increase its EPS by a mid-to-high-single-digit CAGR for the foreseeable future. FactSet also conducts M&A from time to time. Some of the recent deals are listed below:Source: Owler; data as of 9/26/2019.It happens quite often that acquisitions deteriorate capital efficiency, and therefore, shareholder value because of overpaying for the deals. Investors should particularly watch out for such ratios as free cash flow margin and asset turnover. From the tables below, the M&A deals appear to us to have worked fine at FactSet so far.Source: Morningstar; data as of 9/26/2019.Source: Morningstar; data as of 9/26/2019.We think that FactSet is facing two major secular risks, which value/quality investors should concentrate on.It is worth mentioning that approximately 83.9% of FactSet's ASV is derived from buy-side clients.Over the shorter term, the business may face additional risks, which value/quality investors should keep in mind, as follows,Despite the attractiveness of the business model, the share price of FDS looks discouraging to us. Even if we assume a low-teens long-term growth rate, the P/E and P/FCF of around 30x should be by no means reasonable.If comparing the current price multiples to their respective historical averages, we consider the stock 10-20% overpriced at this point.Source: Morningstar; data as of 9/26/2019.Per the charts below, you can see the valuation (measured by P/FCF and EV/EBIT) climbed sharply over the past couple of years.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/26/2019.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/26/2019.We believe that FDS is worth a seat on long-term buy-and-hold investors' watch list. The business model is attractive but not the price, unfortunately, at the moment. We would wait patiently for pullbacks and may accumulate shares at the free cash flow yield close to or even above 5%."

The firm has featured 9.24% sales growth in past five years, along with substantial bottom line margins and free cash flow. The United States accounts for a majority of its revenue, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific.The firm generates substantial portion (84%+) of its revenue from buy-side (investment management) clients, and the remainder comes from sell-side clients. In its latest quarter, FactSet has posted revenue increase of over 3%, reaching $2.1 billion, along with a 40 basis points margin expansion in EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth of 33%.In order to value FactSet, I have used a DCF model and relative value analysis. My DCF model suggests that FactSet is slightly overvalued, relative value suggests the same.(Source: Data from Stockrow, data processed by author)FactSet has maintained strong fundamentals over the years. It has outperformed many of its peers along the way, demonstrating higher profitability and cash flow generation. Some of its peers include Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), Fidelity (NYSE:FIS), Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) and Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK). FactSet’s sales growth and profitability margins have been above industry-average for last five years. On the other hand, the firm’s leverage position is higher than that of its peers. Dividend growth has also been substantial: 13% in 5-year CAGR. It is clear that the firm has both growth and value factors in it, which is why the market has been paying premiums, as reflected in its valuation multiples.(Source: Data from Stockrow, data processed by author)Let’s start with user count growth, which is a fundamental driver of the company's business model. If the investment management industry shifts from an active to a passive approach, there’s a high probability that user count will decline. This is more of a systematic risk in the sense that if such situations emerge, then managing it might not be possible. There are a number of systematic risks in this sense, some of which includes declining returns in capital markets and increasing industry consolidation. More than 84% of its revenue comes from the investment management industry, so the impact of declining returns is directly related. On the other hand, consolidation in the industry may result in significant loss of market share for FactSet.Now let’s shift our focus towards company-specific risks, some of which include currency risks, failure to add new products and enhancements and higher leverage than peers. Approximately 36% of FactSet’s revenue comes from outside of United States, and 73% of its employees and 54% of its leased office space are located outside of the U.S., exposing the firm to currency risk. As of August 31, 2017, it maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its Indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase Indian rupees with U.S. dollars was Rs. 3.8 billion. Currently, it has a net foreign currency exposure of approximately $210 million per year.The firm estimates that if the U.S. dollar had been 10% weaker, the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by $5.4 million, which would have had an immaterial impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. On the other hand, a hypothetical 10% weaker U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies at August 31, 2017, would increase the fair value of total assets by $69.5 million and equity by $61.9 million. Because the financial analytics industry is highly dependent on technological advancement, product innovation and enhancement remains a key challenge for the firm. As for the leverage, currently it has an above-industry debt-to-asset ratio, the presence of which could expose FactSet to higher expenses for interest and principal payments.DCF modelMy DCF model indicates that the intrinsic value of FactSet is $219, implying a slight overvaluation of roughly $5 per share. In order to find its intrinsic value, I have made a number of assumptions. Initial revenue growth assumption is 6.5%, which increases by 50 bps for the next two years and then declines by 50 bps for the last two years, reaching the initial growth rate of 6.5% in the terminal year (2022). Cost of services, SG&A expenses, depreciation and tax rates are assumed to be close to their long-term averages and stay constant. Capex-to-sales is assumed to be constant at 5% for the full valuation period. I have calculated the weighted average cost of capital to be 10.34% and assumed an exit multiple (EV/EBITDA) of 22x.(Source: Based on author's projections and calculations; a table showing the forecast inputs can be found at the notes section)Relative ValueFactSet's relative value suggests that the company is overpriced. However, given its stronger margins and growth, it is fair for the market to pay a premium. Considering these factors, a DCF model might reflect underlying economics better than relative value.(Source: Seeking Alpha)FactSet has demonstrated strong fundamentals over the years. Besides its significant price returns for the period, dividend growth has been nice too. Together, this reflects that the company has both growth and value factors embedded into it. Although it has an above-industry leverage position, substantial cash flow generation and solid top line growth make up for it. Combining all the factors, FactSet is a solid analytics firm but looks just slightly overvalued in my valuation. As a result, FactSet is a hold.The following table outlines various input assumptions and implied margins as results of those inputs.

I'm glad you asked. No, it's not a new diabolical plot hatched by Dr. Evil. It's like a Dividend Aristocrat... only smaller. These are small- and mid-cap companies that have raised their dividend for at least 10 years.The information and delivery service business is a small market sector: there are only 7 companies. The combined market capitalization of all seven is $91 billion. The sector was performing well until the sell-off:This group is up 8.69% for the last year. But, the performance drops off over the last week (-1.4%), month (-7.06%), quarter (-4.58%), and six-months (-.27%).Dun and Bradstreet (DNB) is the 4th smallest issue with a market capitalization of $4.54 billion. They are the cheapest on a PE basis (22.74), the 3rd cheapest on a forward PE basis (16.10) while having the 5th best dividend (1.72%), which they've increased for 11 consecutive years.DNB delivers information to businesses, in two forms: credit (59% of revenue) and sales (41% of sales). Their credit services are designed to help companies make informed decisions about who they extend credit to while the sales and marketing services enable clients to better market and sell their respective services.Let's take a look at their financials, starting with their balance sheet (data from Morningstar.com; author's calculations):I was disappointed after calculating these numbers. With a service company, you'd expect a higher current ratio. There's nothing inherently wrong with a number fluctuating around 1, but considering this company is long-term asset light, a higher number is more likely. And they have a fair amount of debt relative to their assets. Again, this isn't inherently bad, but it's also not encouraging. On the plus side, they've lowered their accounts receivable percentage out of total assets.Here are the relevant numbers from their income statement:Revenue has declined modestly in two of the last four years. SGA expenses have increased substantially. This wouldn't be a problem if they resulted in meaningful income growth. But, that didn't happen. And their interest expense is growing relative to their operating income. All of these factors add up to a declining net margin.FactSet (FDS) is the third smallest member of the information delivery group. You're probably familiar with their earnings data, which is cited by several SA contributors (including me). They are the 5th most expensive on a current and forward PE basis while having the second lowest dividend (1.15%) which they've raised for 12 consecutive years.Their income statement is much better than DNBs.Revenue has increased each of the last five years. Net income did decline in the latest year, but for mostly one-time reasons. From their latest 10-K:The high net income figure for 2016 it was also influenced by a 1-time $81 million dollar event.FactSet's income is growing in tandem with their customer base (from their latest 10-K):And they have a better balance sheet (from their latest 10-K):Their current ratio is slightly over 2 while their debt/assets ratio is 30%.While they are developing a good history of dividend increases, their dividend yield is low, meaning we need to be more aware of the technical environment when looking for an entry point. The daily chart says we're at such a point:They're bouncing off a short-term low in the upper 180s. Assuming they continue to move higher, they won't hit resistance until ~210, about 12% from current levels. And the MACD is low, implying topside room.FactSet has a better balance sheet and earnings history than Dun and Bradstreet. They're clearly the better choice among the ""mini-crats"" that focus on information delivery.This post is not an offer to buy or sell this security.

If you work at a bank or on the buy-side, you're probably familiar with their products. FactSet's core desktop platform is used widely by analysts to pull data for research purposes or to monitor a portfolio. While recent SeekingAlpha articles have been positive, sentiment among the Wall Street investors has declined significantly; among the major brokers, there's 1 buy, 10 holds, and 5 sells. The stock has held in relatively well, but has had significant drops around earnings as the company has missed revenue expectations. While the company fundamentals and its stock has performed well on an absolute basis, there is growing evidence supporting the bear-case around the stock. Source: Google FinanceFactSet Pressure Driven by Exposure to Pressured CustomersFactSet's key financials are slowing. FactSet's revenue and ASV (annual subscription value) trends have decelerated for numerous quarters. ASV is important as it is a leading indicator of revenue trends for FactSet, which bills customers on long-term contracts. Revenue only recognizes a portion of these contracts at a time, whereas ASV is a better indicator of real-time trends in their billings. FactSet's most recent quarter saw organic revenue growth decelerate to 7.0% and organic ASV growth decelerate to 6.5%.Source: Company filingsSource: Company filingsImportantly, these figures have fallen short of investor expectations each time, disappointing investors and sending the stock down abruptly.Source: Company filings, SeekingAlphaThere are a number of factors related to this slowdown, but the primary reason is FactSet's exposure to the financial services sector. FactSet's client base is composed primarily of buy-side clients (83% of revenue), with a bit of sell-side banks sprinkled in (17% of revenue). Both clients have been pressured significantly over the last several years from several major factors.Source: Morningstar 2016 Analyst DayThe result of these major shifts has been a reduction in headcount among the financial services sector. Investors closely watch data from BLS to see how employment has shifted in these areas as pricing and revenue is determined largely by the number of users on FactSet's products. Since mid-2016, headcount growth in portfolio management has been decelerating, and now sits in the low-single digits.Source: BLSThis might not seem so drastic. But the headlines and anecdotes suggest that the underlying deceleration may be steeper:- BlackRock will be cutting active managers and replacing them with tech-driven strategies- Eton Park, a well-known and respected hedge fund, is shutting down- Caxton, Och-Ziff, and Tudor have all reduced investor fees to remain competitive. Average fees have now dropped from 1.7% a decade ago to 1.4%.- Pension funds are reducing hedge fund exposure given their high fees and underperformance. The trend was kicked off by Calpers and has continued with several other large pension funds.- Anecdotally, my peers in the finance community have all been affected, and believe it will continueThese pressures have been felt by the financial services sector for multiple years now, but has decelerated further in recent quarters. As it relates to FactSet's revenues, the prevailing thought was that headwinds were largely cyclical factors affecting the industry, but that they would likely bottom at some point. FactSet has received numerous questions about this, including the following question from their F1Q earnings in December:Source: F1Q17 Earnings Conference CallAs shown in the trends above, the deceleration has continued, putting into question whether the issues are cyclical, temporary factors, or more permanent structural issues. Such structural issues would carry heavy implications:Source: Company filingsSource: Capital IQAs management's response indicated in the quote above, FactSet is focused on providing an entire enterprise offering to offset headwinds. The company has been fairly active in the M&A market, purchasing software outside of their core desktop market. These acquisitions have outperformed and have been good drivers of their performance, but it has not fully offset the core slowdown in their key desktop product (which many banks estimate make up roughly 60-80% of FactSet's revenue). Management has likely recognized the importance of diversifying revenue streams and being less dependent on active equity investors. To be clear, management's actions are a positive for the company and it demonstrates that they've recognized the importance of what's happening to their clients. However, it is also a clear recognition of the changing industry landscape.Source: Company press releasesAnother a potential headwind is clients' ongoing consolidation of data vendors. On the last conference call, management noted that they have seen clients consolidating their data vendor usage in certain circumstances. From the client's perspective, as they consolidate vendors, it becomes more economical to go with one vendor that offers lower bundled pricing as opposed to having many products from different vendors. FactSet noted that they are losing customers in some instances as their product offering does not cover client's entire workflows.In sum, a key pillar of the bear thesis is that FactSet revenue and margin trends will continue to decelerate as the buy-side consolidates and succumbs to ongoing secular issues. As revenue and margin fall short, earnings will fall short as well, thereby putting pressure on the multiple and the stock. Going forward, investors will be closely watching the organic ASV and revenue growth rates to see if they will continue to decelerate or if they will stabilize and reaccelerate (as consensus revenue estimates currently suggest).Source: Brokerage estimatesBull Case - Solid Product with Significant Room for Share GainsThe bull case is that clients are undergoing temporary cyclical issues, but once they subside, FactSet's core product strength and expanded offerings will become more apparent.Solid product: Even with those issues, the company still owns a solid product that is widely used by clients. And while the product has grown significantly from a $250 million business in 2004 to $1.1 billion in 2016, the company estimates that their products own just 10% of its entire addressable market, suggesting much more potential upside for the company.Cross-selling: As management expands its product offering, each product presents an additional cross-selling opportunity as they fill in each customer's workflow needs. Non-desktop offerings have grown in the double digits, supporting the company's overall growth rate. The company has also begun to gain further penetration into new markets such as wealth management, which has been the primary driver of user growth (although these customers have lower ACV values associated with them).Margins currently loaded with up-front costs from acquisitions: As stated above, management believes that margins will grow over the long-term. Currently, margins have been depressed in part by higher company investments, and in part by those acquisitions mentioned above. These acquisitions brought along a significant cost base. And while FactSet may need to invest further to fully integrate these products into their suite of offerings, at some point, they will begin to gain more scale, which should generate margin expansion over time."
4133202,36431,2017-12-21T09:13:25-05:00,"Volatility in FDS shares after recovering some of the losses from what was initially received as a poor Q1.Business remains strong, but exposed to potential market corrections.Valuations appear stretched.","As I write this, FactSet Research Systems (FDS) is recovering a sizable chunk of the losses it incurred on Tuesday.Shares fell after what was initially seen as a poor first quarter to start 2018. The company also provided guidance for EPS of $8.25 to $8.45 versus previous consensus of $8.19, and organic annual subscription value, or ASV, growth of 5.1%. Despite the light top-line, I didn't really think the company's Q1 was really that bad.FactSet earned roughly 27% return on invested capital in fiscal 2017, which is impressive and likely far above its cost of capital. I'd say it remains an above average operation, therefore. This is lower than last year's ROIC, however, which clocked in at roughly 37%. This was largely a result of a significant increase in debt, as well as an increase in equity - which combined greatly expanded the firm's capital base (the denominator in the ROIC equation). The firm also earned higher operating profit during 2017, but it didn't increase fast enough to outpace the growth in debt and equity, hence the lower ROIC. Despite the weakening ROIC and balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio now past 1x), FDS shares are now pricier than they were the last time I wrote about the company, now trading at almost 27 times 2017's adjusted earnings per share. There are other mounting risks going forward that could also negatively affect the firm's business as well. A decline in overall equity and/or fixed income returns could cause a significantly negative impact on business (due to declining buying power of investment management clients), as 84.1% of ASV is related to buy-side clients. 15.9% of ASV is also related to sell-side clients.We're currently in a very long bull market, and if (or when) it ends, this could mean less business for FactSet overall, but on the flip-side, its business also appears to be relatively ""sticky"". Annual client retention was more than 95% of ASV in fiscal 2017, or 91% if expressing it as a percentage of clients. It's also still growing:Source: FactSet 10-KThe total number of clients increased by 12.8% in 2017, with ASV growth up 5.7%. That's slightly better ASV growth than what occurred in Q1, so it's a number to watch closely going forward for the rest of fiscal 2018.FactSet's underlying return on equity increased year-over-year, but largely because of the magnifying effects of leverage. The firm's asset turnover ratio continued to sink, which indicates weakening efficiency as the growth of its assets outstrips the growth in sales. Operating margins also continued their descent. Looking at the company's 2016 income statement, there was a ""gain on sale of business"" wedged between operating profit and pretax profit - which amounted to $112,453 (in thousands). If we decide to back this out, then ROE for 2016 looks much different.Backing out the gain from EBT (now adjusted to $348,540 in thousands), then used the two year average tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (where there were no abnormal gains, equaling roughly 29.04%) we can arrive at an adjusted net income. This puts the company's ROE only slightly higher in 2016 from 2015, likely because of the slight uptick in leverage. As previously noted, leverage also increased in 2017, so it appears this trend (along with a weakening asset turnover ratio and sinking margins) is here to stay.It appears that FactSet's fundamentals are deteriorating on most measurable fronts, and the possibility of declining equity and/or fixed income markets remains a looming threat. Despite this, FDS shares trade above their five-year average multiple of 25.6 and the thirteen-year median multiple of roughly 24.5 times earnings.Analysts now expect the company to earn roughly $8.29 in EPS for fiscal 2018 and $9.06 in fiscal 2019, which translates to growth of 13.4% in 2018, and another 9.3% from 2018 through 2019. Putting valuations into context with growth paints a different picture.Utilizing a conservative 10% to 12% discount rate range implies about 6% to 8% of growth currently baked into the share price, which is a decent amount less than what analysts are expecting, indicating undervaluation on a growth basis.I think FDS shares could be slightly undervalued here if the company is able to hit earnings estimates over the next two years, but I also think that's a big if. We could be facing the end of multiple bull markets (in bonds and equities) over that period, so I think there's a higher amount of risk to FactSet's business than usual here. I also think the quality of the business slightly decreased year-over-year, coupled with a weakening of the balance sheet. Despite the sliding quality metrics, I still think it remains an above-average company, though. I'll continue to avoid shares at this level, largely due to the inherent (and rising) risks to its business and the overall valuation levels that have risen past historical multiples on a relative basis.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page next to the author's name."

BISAM has developed a unified risk and performance approach to providing asset managers with investment analytics and management solutions. The acquisition promises to provide meaningful new capabilities to FactSet’s asset management offerings.Target CompanyParis, France-based BISAM was founded in 2000 by co-founders Alexandre Harkous, CTO Xavier Chaude and Christophe Volard to provide a suite of analytics software, reporting and data management solutions to the asset investment and management industry.The firm is headed by CEO William Haney, who has been with the firm since late 2014 and was previously a global head and general manager for various units within Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI).BISAM’s offerings include:Notable customers included Fiduciary Trust Company International, Acadian Asset Management and Kames Capital.Below is a brief explainer video about the company's ""Unification of Performance & Risk"" approach:(Source: BISAM)In March 2016, BISAM acquired FinAnalytica for an undisclosed sum.FinAnalytica had developed its Cognity Risk Analytics Platform, a system that provides greater visibility into the trade-offs between performance and risk that investment managers are increasingly demanding in a volatile investment environment.Cognity has become a major piece in BISAM’s offerings to asset managers as part of its ""Unification of Performance & Risk"" mantra.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryFactSet is paying $205.2 million to acquire BISAM from its private equity owner Aquiline Capital Partners and insiders. Management says the deal is expected to be ""dilutive by $0.06 to GAAP diluted EPS for the remainder of fiscal 2017.""BISAM’s 2016 annual revenues were ""over $28 million,"" so it appears FactSet paid a multiple of 7.3x trailing 12-month revenues. Aquiline had acquired a majority stake in BISAM in 2012 for an undisclosed amount. The stated aim of the Aquiline investment was to increase BISAM’s penetration into North America and APAC geographies.Since that majority stake acquisition, the company partnered with integrator Stradegi in Singapore, where Stradegi provides local business development, implementation and customer support for BISAM in multiple APAC regions.FactSet said in the transaction announcement that concurrent with the deal, it has ""borrowed $575 million under a new revolving credit facility to fund the transaction and repay existing debt.""As of its most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2016, FactSet had long-term debt of $365 million, cash and equivalents of $173 million, and cash flow from operations of $51 million, so it appears the company has ample facility to accomplish the transaction without undue financial stress.FactSet aims to combine BISAM’s offerings with its suite of portfolio analytics and client reporting solutions that it sells to asset management firms worldwide. In addition, the Cognity system acquired through BISAM’s acquisition of FinAnalytica promises to add capabilities to ""FactSet’s risk analysis for derivative and quantitative portfolio construction.""As the environment for asset management continues with elevated risk levels and the need for high performance, demand for a unified and consistent risk and performance data in a single suite of offering is something that FactSet clients and prospects may find more compelling.The rationale for the deal is logical, and I expect to see positive results over the medium term as FactSet begins to roll out its increased capabilities to the asset management industry.I write about IPOs and M&A deals.

4042830,36431,2017-02-06T05:25:44-05:00,"I like FDS's business.Capital allocation metrics are stellar, but some adjustments need to be made.The price of FDS shares looks steep, is it justified?","FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) on the surface looks like a great business that benefits from size-and-scale and is able to generate abnormal amounts of economic profits. Its client retention ratio is around 95%, and a high amount of recurring revenues indicates that not only are profits good, but the ""stickiness"" of its business is as well. To top things off, it's also developing a reputation as a reliable dividend payer, with over a decade of increases now under its belt.Economic profits are stellarBelow I built a model in Excel to calculate FactSet's economic profit spread, or said differently, the amount that its return on invested capital, or ROIC, exceeds its weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. I used data from the firm's financial statements.We could argue that FactSet is running a top-notch operation here, and likely earning wide economic profits. This is the moat around its economic castle, spilling into the numbers.FactSet also utilizes a sizable amount of off-balance sheet financing in the form of operating leases, so for those curious, I also decided to add these back into the capital structure and see the results.Back onto the balance sheet...The first step involves determining a value for the operating leases so that we can theoretically capitalize them. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any traces of capital leases on the books, and the pretax cost of debt looked a little low as a discount rate, so I decided to use an estimate of 5.50% for the firms leases. Below are the results.Next, I decided to add them back into the mix and estimate an adjusted capital structure.I'd say that the firm's debt-to-equity ratio is likely notably higher if we consider its off-balance sheet leases, which also affects ROIC. I will address this issue in the next section.Adjusting EBIT and ROICNow that we have some more information regarding the company's leases, we can also account for them when recalculating return on invested capital. First we need to adjust the numerator in the ROIC-equation - net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT.Now that we have adjusted operating profit, we can take taxes into account and divide this number by the adjusted capital base.Assuming a 5.50% rate for the company's leases (probably not a 100% accurate number, but rather an estimate to get a rough idea of the leases' impact), we can see that ROIC is around 11% to 12% lower than advertised before adjustments. This number is still quite impressive, though.The equity slice comes nextNow that we've established there's a good chance that FDS earns wide economic profits, we can single out the equity portion of the capital structure and analyze return on equity, or ROE, next.I broke down its ROE into five pieces with the above DuPont analysis using data from its financial statements. From this, we can see that the company maintains enviable operating margins, despite a slight dip in fiscal 2016. ROE has sequentially increased over the last three years, with annual increases in leverage to magnify it along the way.The abnormal pop in ROE in 2016 stood out like a sore thumb, however, as both margins and asset turnover decreased, but ROE increased by almost 20% year-over-year. The first thing I noticed was the interest burden.Looking at the company's 2016 income statement, I found out that there was a ""gain on sale of business"" wedged between operating profit, aka EBIT, and pretax profit, aka EBT, which amounted to $112,453 (in thousands). If we decide to back this out, then ROE for 2016 looks decidedly different.I backed the gain out of EBT (now adjusted to $348,540 in thousands), then used the two year average tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 (where there were no abnormal gains, equaling roughly 29.04%) to arrive at net income. Then I created the below chart in Excel to arrive at a more normalized ROE number.This puts the company's ROE only slightly higher year-over-year, likely because of the slight uptick in leverage. This is still an impressive number, however.ConclusionFactSet appears to be an above average operation, earning economic profits, which likely explains why it's been able to continue to raise its dividend annually for over ten years now. Sometimes higher capital allocation metrics in younger businesses attracts competitors. These competitors then drive down economic profits and eroded the once abnormally-excellent business' economic profit spread back down to its cost of capital. This might not be the immediate case with FDS, as I think that as long as its business model relies on a large amount of recurring revenue streams amongst a ""sticky"" user base, this abnormal level of profitability can continue going forward.The flip-side to this bullish scenario involves the elevated level of the overall market. If the market dives (not saying it will, not saying it won't), I think there will be far less demand for research. This is why I'm not really comfortable paying a premium multiple for a fractional ownership position in FactSet just yet.I don't think the company is grossly overvalued per say at a tad over 24 times this year's expected earnings, since it traditionally trades at a multiple north of 20, but I'm slightly concerned about the ""E"" in the P/E equation if things go south on a macroeconomic level. This is why I'm still on the sidelines, planning to revisit shares if there's a more notable disconnect between price and value.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page next to the author's name."

An investor is left to research competitors of known companies, allocate a budget among stock selection services, and browse through online articles of new investment ideas. Considering the amount of time and effort that one dedicates to the process, it's a wonder how certain companies manage to slip completely under the radar despite being in plain view.Among the plethora of quarterly earnings reports, a phrase similar to the following one is usually found: ""Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) reports earnings of $0.30 per share, below FactSet consensus estimate of $0.37."" After innumerable readings, the question inevitably arose: ""What is FactSet anyway?"" The answer reveals an intriguing opportunity. FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) provides data aggregation software to the financial services industry, including the portfolio managers, analysts, investment bankers, and researchers that make up that marketplace.Since its founding 39 years ago, the company has nestled into a solid niche, achieving revenue growth in 36 consecutive years and earnings growth in 20 consecutive years. The advent of the 401(k) in the 1980s, exponential growth of mutual funds, the emergence of the internet, and the growing needs of institutional investors have clearly done wonders for FactSet's business over the last thirty-plus years.The Virtuous CycleWithin the investment community, there is a myriad of data providers offering financial data, economic statistics, earnings estimates, and other information vital to the operation of investment firms. While the data from any single provider may be inadequate on its own, acquiring this information from all relevant providers could prove to be time-consuming and prohibitively costly for a standalone firm.That is precisely where FactSet finds its niche. The company contracts with more than 220 data suppliers, 115 news sources, and 85 securities exchanges on behalf of its clients. From there, it delivers this information through proprietary software which aggregates data from the various sources. Clients benefit through superior data mining capabilities and improved research and analytical outcomes.A targeted analysis of FactSet's primary stakeholder groups provides further insight into the business, including the company values and some of the key factors of its past success:Management - Three of the top executives have twenty years of history with FactSet. Although they have only recently been appointed to their current positions, this prior experience gives them a thorough understanding of the business, including the organizational knowledge and values needed to sustain the superior company culture, which is so vital to its success.Employees - This cultural advantage enables FactSet to benefit from a highly engaged workforce. Employees enjoy being involved in a company that has been named to Fortune's ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" eight times in the past nine years. In addition, 78% would recommend it to a friend and 91% approve of the company CEO, according to surveys on Glassdoor.Customers - Most employees begin work as consultants, who are assigned to specific clients to gain familiarity with users' needs and assist them in using the system more productively. Clients total 3,092, with 66,000 users worldwide. FactSet consultants made 45,000 client visits last year. This averages out to nearly 15 visits per client, ensuring that each one receives lots of hands-on service. The results of this client-focused business strategy are clear: 97% of clients have indicated they are satisfied with the service, and the current customer retention rate is 94%.Shareholders - Investors have benefited through 169% share price appreciation in ten years, plus eleven consecutive years of dividend increases in excess of 10%. The total and annualized stock price appreciation for the past 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods are presented in the following table:In summary, a management team with vast experience in the business sets objectives and maintains the values and strategic focus that have made the company so successful. And the superior work culture motivates its employees to perpetuate the quality customer service valued by clients - a cycle which has repeated itself over time for 36 years.While clients enjoy the superior service of FactSet, the primary reason they do business is to gain access to the valuable analytical and decision making tools made available through the company's online, subscription-based platform. The compilation of data from various sources all available at a single point of access provides clients a highly useful tool for market intelligence, investment selection, and risk management.While it hasn't reached the level of ERP systems, robust software like FactSet's does come with inherent customer switching costs. That's because changing systems is a costly and risky proposition for customers, particularly after a current system has become embedded in existing work processes.In its premium service, Morningstar has pointed out that FactSet's relationship with data providers and its proprietary software also make for an imposing defense against would-be challengers who likely will find it difficult to obtain the same volume of information in a cost-effective manner and organize it in a way that is useful for clients.The company achieves a virtuous cycle through the culmination of the natural customer switching costs and barriers against new market entrants. Both of these provide the firm with a self-reinforcing competitive advantage in its industry. The business has multiple hallmarks of outstanding long-term stock selections which provide valuable services, sustain quality business practices, and compound its intrinsic value over a long time horizon. The question prospective investors must ask themselves is whether such an increase in the intrinsic value of the business will translate to an increase in the market value and, therefore, a satisfactory return.Sensitivity Analysis of Expected ReturnsNow that we have a solid understanding of the business, let's begin to construct a future expected rate of return that FDS stock will provide under various scenarios. We'll develop a five-year forecast using the stock's current valuation and assumptions for its annual earnings growth and future price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.Analysts project FactSet's fiscal-year earnings to total $7.28 per share, which puts its forward earnings multiple at 24.4 based on Friday's closing price. We'll project earnings growth during the period anywhere from negative 2% to 16%, which will give us a bull and bear case, with analysts' five-year expected earnings growth ranging from 7.3% to 10.7% according to Zacks, Morningstar, and Yahoo Finance. Applying a P/E ratio of 10 to 26 at the end of this period and tacking on 1% per year for the dividend yield, we can see the following possible results for an investment in FDS stock.FDS 5-Year Annualized Return Under Various ScenariosSince FactSet trades at a moderate premium to the broader market, the worst-case scenario of negative earnings growth and a rerating to a lower multiple would have dire consequences for holders of the stock, as can be seen from the 17% annualized loss in the top left-hand corner of the chart.Alternatively, if the company achieves its projected 10% earnings growth and also maintains its P/E of 24, it will return 11% annually to shareholders in the next five years. The most optimistic scenario presented is an 18% annualized return assuming 16% earnings growth and a 26 P/E multiple, as shown in the bottom right-hand corner.Initiation Price TargetWith those scenarios in mind, let's refine the method to determine the price at which we would need to purchase FDS stock in order to achieve a target rate of return from capital appreciation under a given set of assumptions. We'll assume an earnings growth rate of 10% and a P/E ratio of 18 to make our base initiation price target more conservative than the present valuation and to account for future uncertainty. We'll throw in 5% and 15% growth scenarios for good measure, with the earnings multiple valuation reflecting the lower or higher growth rate under each assumption. The results of this analysis are summarized below:We can see that to achieve stock price appreciation of 12%, FactSet would have to decline from its current market price by 32% before it reaches a price where new buyers would achieve a 12% annualized return under the assumptions presented in the middle column. Under the most optimistic assumption presented, with 15% growth and a 22 P/E, FactSet stock remains undervalued by 3% based on the 12% return rate targeted for this analysis.Decision TimeAs with any stock, the analysis is a helpful one and can enable an investor to replace tendencies toward emotional trading with a sound decision making process. After developing an understanding of the company, current valuation, future prospects, and expected return under various scenarios, my own decision is that an investment in FDS stock is a risk not worth taking at the present time. This decision is due to some of the risks facing the company, while also taking into account current valuation.Some of the primary risks affecting a decision whether to invest in the stock include the secular shift to passive investing, the prospect of a decline in equity markets in the case of a recession or bear market, and the moderate premium for which it currently trades. Despite the fact that the most optimistic scenario indicates FactSet to be mildly undervalued, that scenario assumes two key factors: earnings growth will be robust, and each of the primary risk factors will resolve favorably. Such a set of assumptions does not offer much margin of safety to the investment thesis.In contrast, the other scenarios indicate significant downside risk. Reducing or eliminating such risks would seem to be a prudent and wise decision for investors under current market conditions. Although not on my buy list right now, FDS makes for an excellent watchlist addition. And by evaluating the underlying business and potential return under a given set of assumptions, investors can know with confidence the price which they should pay to initiate a position in the stock, should the market offer us such an opportunity in the future.Author's Note: Investors who valued this analysis and wish to receive future articles and ideas from The Virtuous Cycle can do so by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of the article and selecting real-time alerts."
4009169,83156,2016-09-29T09:15:06-04:00,"FactSet missed on the top and bottom line in the latest quarter.
        The news wasn't all bad though. Customer retention was still strong and ASV was up high-single digits.
        There are two major risks to the outlook.
        The stock is still too expensive after the latest decline, and investors should require a much higher risk premium.","FactSet (NYSE:FDS) latest quarter was strong in some areas, but overall it disappointed. Sales increased 9.7% y/y but missed estimates, and EPS came up short as well. The stock is down 5% but we still think it's too expensive based on some major risks to the outlook.Higher cancellations from buy-side and hedge fund clients were the main reason why sales missed estimates. However FDS still kept its client retention rate above 95%. Client renewal rates rarely drop below 95%, and this is the key strength of FDS's business model. FDS bundles a broad range of services, data, and information onto a single platform, which makes the product an attractive one-stop shop for clients. Once its services are installed, it makes little sense for customers to switch to another information provider, thus switch costs are high, customer loyalty is strong, and FDS has pricing power. In the latest quarter, annual subscription value (an indicator of demand for the next 12 months) grew 8.8%. The buy side, which accounts for 82.6% of ASV growth, increased 9%, and the sell side ASV increased 7.6%.Operating expenses in the latest quarter grew at a faster pace than revenues due to a sizeable increase in headcount and costs related to the Portware acquisition. Adjusted operating margin declined from 34.6% to 33.4%, but the decline in profitability shouldn't be a big concern for investors. As Morningstar points out, FDS experienced post-acquisition margin dips in prior years, but margins subsequently expanded thanks to higher leverage of technology fixed costs. And, thanks to its subscription-based revenue model, FDS doesn't have to invest much in order to generate incremental revenues and profits. This keeps margins and returns on invested capital high: over the past five years, FDS has averaged a five year median operating margin of 32.9% and a ROIC in the mid-to-high 30s.Despite these strengths there are major risks to the outlook and investors should avoid FactSet. Financial markets around the world are in a bubble. Thanks to low interest rates and quantitative easing valuation ratios continue to expand even though the underlying economic growth is absent. FactSet's business is highly exposed to a market correction, and we think one is likely to occur within the next couple years. During crashes or periods of high volatility, customers trim their budgets and it becomes more difficult to raise prices. The second major risk stems from the secular shift from active to passive investing. Active investors attempt to generate alpha by analyzing financial data and selecting specific stocks that they expect will outperform the market, while passive investors simply purchase ETFs that mimic broad market indices. Studies have shown that active investors actually underperform the market after fees, and ETFs are proving to be a more efficient and cost-effective way to invest. Passive investment doesn't require extensive research or access to financial data, and while the shift to passive investing will be gradual, it poses a huge threat to FactSet's business.Conclusion:Investors should avoid FactSet even after the selloff. The company may possess some strong advantages and a capital-efficient revenue model, but FDS is exposed to significant short term and secular risks that pose a real threat to the business."
3813436,99116,2016-01-15T13:21:20-05:00,"We are nearing the 1-year anniversary of FactSet's acquisition of ETF.com.ETF.com is still free. This is great for ETF investors, bad for FactSet investors.FactSet stock is down approximately 7.4% since the announcement approximately 9 months ago.FactSet recently announced a partnership with Best Credit Data, Inc for muni bond data distribution - potential acquisition target?The SPDR Innovative Technology ETF just launched based on the FactSet Innovative Technology Index.","Why We Love FactSetThere is one overwhelming reason why we love FactSet Research Systems Inc (NYSE:FDS). Going back to April 2, 2015, FDS had just announced that it would be acquiring one of our favorite ETF data websites, ETF.com, for an undisclosed amount.ETF.com assured its readers that there would be ""Nothing Changing1"" in their website post announcing the acquisition. They further promised: ""All of the data and information you've come to rely on from ETF.com will continue to be available to you, free of charge, on our website."" We love ETF.com, and find its database highly useful. However, just because FX Metrix loves ETF.com, does not mean that the markets love FDS for acquiring it.No Love From the MarketsOn April 2, 2015 FDS opened at $159.85 per share, and closed higher at $159.99 per share that day having announced the acquisition of ETF.com's data and analytics businesses. Fast-forward approximately 9 months to today, and we find FDS stock down $11.81 per share since then as of today's close at $148.18 per share (it has fallen lower in after-hours trading). That represents a roughly 7.4% drop from the date of the acquisition announcement.It is difficult to blame the negative stock performance on a poorly timed acquisition, especially since EPS has risen since then along with the dividend. However, it is important to note that the market rewards acquisitions that provide a return! FDS data by YChartsBest Credit Data, Inc. in FactSet's Acquisition Cross-Hairs?This is important to note only a few hours after FDS announced a partnership to distribute municipal bond data from Best Credit Data, Inc. While this partnership is positive news for now, it is important for FDS investors to keep an eye on. Reading all the way to the bottom of the press release3, we see an interesting line in Best Credit Data's company description: ""Best Credit Data expects to close its next round of funding in Q1 2016."" It seems like a prime acquisition target for FDS, especially following the recent partnership announcement.When the Street Comes KnockingIf and when FDS investors start to demand more of a return from the company's ETF.com acquisition, a 'freemium' or pay to play model may arise.Currently, FactSet sells proprietary ETF data feeds to its data subscribers2, however as mentioned they have kept all website data free to access. This could be eating into potential revenue streams for the data provider that has yet to be tapped.FactSet's New ""Innovative"" ETFsETF.com is not the only way that FactSet stands to make money from the booming ETF industry. Just launched on NYSEARCA, is the SPDR Innovative Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:XITK) which is based on the equal weight FactSet Innovative Technology Index4,5. This ETF is unique because despite being labeled as a Technology ETF, it also has exposure to the electronic media sector through positions like WebMD Health Corp. (NASDAQ:WBMD) in its holdings.Additionally, the ETF is labeled as ""Innovative."" This leaves potential investors questioning: how is innovation measured? Its impossible to perfectly quantify things like innovation, so instead the minds behind XITK used revenue growth as the determining metric for index membership.XITK marks the first of a series of 3 ETFs to be launched by State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) based on FactSet's indices7. Upcoming FactSet Index benchmarked ETFs include:These new products should provide steady licensing revenue streams for FactSet as those funds launch and gain in popularity. For now FactSet gets to sit back, rebalance quarterly, and collect. FactSet stands to make good money off of the index licensing fees mentioned in the fund's prospectus6. The success of this will determine how active FactSet will be going forward in the ETF world. It is important to note, that these ""Innovative"" funds will be competing against some similar funds already selling innovation exposure to investors such as the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), and the ARK Industrial Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKQ). Below is a comparison of XITK vs. ARKK and ARKQ:First, this comparison shows that the new ""innovative"" offering from SPDR is a far cheaper fund for investors to gain exposure to innovation based on current expense ratios. This is presumably due to the efficiencies gained from being an affiliated index ETF vs. an actively managed ETF. Additionally, based on AUM we see that XITK has almost caught up ARKK, with just over $2 million worth of inflows needed to tie. Given the lower fees, it would not be surprising if more ARKK investors jumped ship for the SPDR counterpart.ConclusionAs ETF investing becomes more and more popular, it will be important that data and information regarding ETFs is easily accessible. ETFs are of growing popularity not just in the United States, but also in countries like Canada, South Korea, and more. If this or other similar sites were to become private or paid only, it could be a substantial threat to retail ETF market participants. While investors could always fall back on trusty fund prospectuses and annual reports, there is something far easier about being able to compare investment opportunities side-by-side.Additionally, stock price performance since the FDS acquisition of ETF.com should be heeded as a warning regarding recent developments with Best Credit Data, Inc. If FactSet makes another acquisition in current market conditions, it may not be well received on Wall street.The positive about FDS, is the recent and upcoming push into providing ETF benchmarks starting with the launch of XITK. We look forward to the two upcoming launches of SPDR's ""Innovative"" family of funds focusing on the health care and manufacturing sectors. We are curious to see if XITK takes marketshare from existing ETFs that sell innovation as time goes on and more become privy to the alternative available. Factset will certainly be on our radar in the months to come, and we will be on the lookout for more details regarding the next funds to launch.References:"
3264305,50662,2015-06-18T07:31:30-04:00,"Factset reports once again a very nice revenue, cash flow and net profit growth.The company is trading at a free cash flow yield of less than 4% so it's quite expensive.On the positive side, all of its free cash flow (and more) is being spent on treating its shareholders through a dividend and share buybacks.Factset is a bit too expensive for me up here, but I have put the company on my watchlist as it's a cash flow generator.","IntroductionFactset Research (NYSE:FDS) has been on my watch-list as a non-mining diversification, but unfortunately I didn't buy any stock last year below the $105-110 threshold. That's a pity, as the company's share price has increased by more than 50% to $160+.In this article I will dig a bit deeper into the company's recent financial statements to determine if I should chase the stock price and buy shares at $160, or if I should wait for a dip before initiating a position.The Q3 results and the YTD cash flowsIn the third quarter of its financial year 2015, Factset generated a total revenue of almost $255M, a very nice increase of 10% compared to the same quarter last year. As its operating expenses increased at a slower rate, the operating income increased by a stunning 17% to $85M, resulting in a net income of $61.4M, an increase of almost 20%. That's quite nice and once again shows Factset's very impressive growth trajectory as the company's revenue has increased every year since the Global Financial Crisis, and is widely expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future.Source: financial statementsI probably bore my loyal readers, but I would once again like to emphasize the importance of the cash flow statements over the income statement. It's definitely more difficult to apply accounting tricks on the cash flow statements, so that's what I usually focus on.Factset reported an operating cash flow of $222.8M for the first three quarters of its FY 2015, a 15% increase compared to the first nine months of last year. When you look at the capital expenditures (and you obviously need to exclude the money spent on acquiring new businesses), it increased at a faster pace to $29M (assuming the purchase of 'investments' are related to the normal course of doing business).Source: financial statementsThis means that Factset had a positive free cash flow of $194M in the first nine months of the year, resulting in an annualized free cash flow of $260M. The majority of the free cash flow was spent on share buybacks [to the tune of $177M, or 2.5% of the company's total amount of outstanding shares (in just 9 months)], and a small dividend which currently stands at a 1.1% dividend yield but costs the company approximately $75M per year.This means that Factset is spending more money on its buybacks and dividend than its annualized free cashflow, and that's something the company will have to keep in mind. Okay, the balance sheet still looks extremely strong (see later), but I prefer it if companies don't spend more than the real cash inflow. Additionally, I'm not sure spending money to buy back shares when the share price is trading at 26 times the free cash flow is a good thing to do. If there's nothing else the money could be spent on, sure, then it's better than hoarding cash.The balance sheet is still robustThere's no need to worry about Factset's 'overspending' pattern as 1) the difference between cash inflow and outflow isn't huge and 2) the balance sheet is extremely robust so Factset doesn't have to worry about the near-term future at all.Source: financial statementsThe company's working capital position is almost $170M and as the current assets are sufficient to cover the TOTAL liabilities of Factset, this is the text book example of a clean and robust balance sheet. Long story short, nothing to worry about here!Investment thesisThe annualized free cash flow yield is just below 4%, so Factset is currently quite expensive. I'm also not sure it's a good idea to repurchase shares when those are trading this high, but if the cash can't be spend on something else then those repurchases are the best way to move forward.At a FCF yield of 4%, I'm not interested in Factset at all and it looks like the train has left the station. In such situations, I usually write put options to try to get paid whilst I wait for the share price to come down a bit. For Factset I'm looking at the P120 with an expiry date in December for an option premium of $1.00. That's not much (an annualized return of just below 1.7%) but I don't want to pay $160 per share right now, and at a share price of $120 and 41 million outstanding shares (which I expect to be the number in FY 2017) and a 3% annual increase in free cash flow, I'd be happy to pick some shares up as the FCF yield in this scenario would be approximately 5.6%."
3989063,50662,2016-07-18T08:44:26-04:00,"Factset continues to generate a robust and predictable amount of free cash flow.Despite having hiked the dividend by 25% in the past 18 months, less than 1/3 of the free cash flow is being spent on dividends.Factset continues to buy back stock, and will now even accelerate its buyback program after having sold a subsidiary.I'm not sure buying back stock at a free cash flow yield of 4% is a good move, but given the limited capital allocation possibilities, it's an acceptable strategy.I still don't have a long position but will continue to (try to) write put options to try to pick up stock at a lower price.","IntroductionFactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) (hereafter 'Factset' or 'FDS') is one of the most consistent performers in terms of revenue, income and cash flows as its business model is capex-light and the company can rely on a loyal client base, using its databases of financial information. The userbase continued to grow, and Factset now has in excess of 3,000 clients and a user count of in excess of 63,000.FDS data by YChartsA high P/E ratio doesn't mean the company is overpricedFactset is quite happy with the results of the third quarter of its financial year 2016, as its client count increased by almost 0.5% whilst the user count increased by in excess of 7.7% to 63,500 users. It seems like when you treat your employees well (Factset has been named one of the 'best companies to work for' based on a Fortune-investigation), their happiness will reflect on how business is being done.FDS Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe total revenue in the quarter increased by approximately 13%, but unfortunately the total operating expenses increased by almost 17% to $198M and that's the main reason why the operating income increased at a slower rate (4.5% to $89M). Notwithstanding the higher pre-tax income, Factset's tax bill in the second quarter was actually lower, and this allowed the company to boost its net income by 8.9% to $66.7M. As Factset continues to repurchase its own stock, the impact of the higher net income was even more noticeable in the EPS-results, as the per-share result was boosted by 11%.Source: SEC filingsThat's definitely not bad, and it doesn't look like Factset just had a 'lucky' quarter, as the performance in the third quarter seems to be pretty consistent with the H1 results. The 9M revenue increased by 12.7% and the EPS was boosted by approximately 10% and this actually indicates the third (and second) quarter was better than the first quarter, on the back of the company's new acquisition (so this shouldn't really surprise you).Factset's balance sheet remains quite strong as its net cash position (here defined as cash + investments - debt) remains very reasonable at just over $90M, despite having paid in excess of a quarter of a billion for Portware, a provider of 'multi-asset trade automation solutions'. This acquisition was paid for with debt, and that's also the reason why Factset had to pay $424,000 in interest expenses versus earning $534,000 in the second quarter of the previous financial year.After three quarters of the financial year, a clearer picture is emerging - and an accelerated share repurchase program will continue to support the bottom lineIn the first nine months of the financial year, Factset generated a total operating cash flow of $261.1M, which was reduced to $235M after taking the changes in its working capital position into consideration. The total capex was $34.7M but this did contain some non-recurring expenses such as the payments associated with the acquisition of Portware and the 'fit-out' of office space in New York, Chicago and Connecticut. The sustaining capex was very likely quite a bit lower than that, but for the sake of simplicity I will take the company's official $35M, which brings the free cash flow at exactly $200M in the first nine months of the year.Source: SEC filingsThe dividend has been hiked again (by more than 10%) to a quarterly payout of $0.50. The $2 per year will result in a net cash outflow of approximately $80M (taking the accelerated buyback program - see later - into consideration) per year, or roughly $60M for three quarters. Based on these facts, Factset had approximately $140M in sustaining post-dividend free cash flow it could use to repurchase stock, and that's exactly what the company did, as it spent $193M on share repurchases. Yes, that's a bit higher than the sustaining free cash flow (after the dividend payment), but as Factset was able to create additional cash inflow by converting non-cash working capital into hard dollars, I don't particularly mind the 'overspending' on share repurchases.FDS Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThe company's board of directors has approved an increase of the existing buyback program by $165M. This means Factset is now authorized to spend $360M on share repurchases and the company doesn't seem to be hesitant to use this buyback allowance. Now the $165M sale of its market research business has been completed, Factset has entered into an agreement with the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for an accelerated share repurchase for a total consideration of US$120M. According to Factset's statement, it expects to receive a minimum of 0.6 million shares (which seems quite low as this would indicate an average repurchase price of up to $200M, so I do hope Factset will be able to cancel more shares…).Investment thesisI'm always a little bit concerned when a company is (A) overspending on share buybacks and (B) repurchasing shares at a relatively high valuation. Based on the adjusted free cash flow in the first nine months of the financial year, I would expect Factset to generate $270M in free cash flow for FY 2016. As the company will have a share count of approximately 40 million shares by the end of this year, this would result in a FCF/share of $6.75, for a FCF yield of 4.05%.So, no, Factset is not a bargain, but I think it says a lot about Factset's possibilities to allocate its capital in a value-creating way. Even though Factset's business model is very robust, I'm not too keen on buying stock of a company with a free cash flow yield of just 4%. In my previous article I discussed the potential to write some out of the money put options to 'harvest' the option premium whilst waiting for the company's valuation to become cheaper, and I think I will stick with that plan. The P120 September I recommended to write will very likely expire worthless, allowing me to repeat this strategy - depending on the option premiums."

        Recent performance has been solid and should continue, but the firm's valuation is not as attractive as we would like. Shares are trading at high multiples.
        Though value investors may be turned off, Factset has robust free cash flow generation and low financial leverage, giving it excellent dividend prospects.
        Let's take a look at the company's investment considerations and determine a fair value estimate for shares.","By Brandon UtesThe securities research industry is increasingly competitive, but FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS) has effectively made a name for itself. Recent performance has been solid, and FactSet is among the best in our coverage universe in terms of generating economic value for shareholders.FactSet Research recently reported 2015 third-quarter results, reporting robust growth in key areas of the business including an ASV growth rate of ~9%, the highest ASV growth rate in 3 years. The firm's 14% increase in earnings per share marked its 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted growth. That's incredible!With a new CEO ready to step in on July 1, the firm is looking to continue its pace of expansion. The firm has excellent free cash flow and low financial leverage, resulting in a Dividend Cushion ratio of 3.8 or an EXCELLENT dividend safety rating. Dividend investors have benefited from consistent dividend increases, and we rate its dividend growth potential as EXCELLENT.The future for Factset Research looks promising. Overall growth is strong, and shareholders benefit from increasing capital returns. But with any investment, price matters, and shares aren't cheap at the moment. Let's dig deeper into what we're talking about and determine a fair value estimate for shares.Factset Research's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Factset Research's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.• FactSet provides financial information and analytical applications to the investment community. The firm combines content about securities from markets all over the globe into a single online platform of information and analytics. Buy-side clients account for ~80% of 'Annual Subscription Value' (NASDAQ:ASV).• Factset Research has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 28.3% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter. The company's capital commitments are minimal.• Though we like Factset's research product, the market for providing financial information and software solutions to the global investment community is highly competitive. Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) are two competitors, for example. The market appears rational, however, as operating margins remain robust.• Recent performance has been solid. ASV continues to advance at a mid-single-digit organic pace, and recent quarterly results have revealed the best growth since 2006 as the number of buy-side users expand at a pace not seen since 2004.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisFrom our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Factset Research's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 224.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Economic profit creation is simply fantastic.Cash Flow AnalysisFree cash flow has been outstanding at Factset Research. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Factset Research's free cash flow margin has averaged about 35.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Factset Research, cash flow from operations decreased about 37% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 21% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe ""facts are set"" -- now we move to the assumptions that drive our valuation analysis. Let's walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Factset Research's shares are worth between $103-$155 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$164, well above our fair value estimate. In our eyes, upside potential associated with shares is essentially nonexistent, and downside risk is material. The market loves its shares, meaning any slip-up could send them tumbling.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $129 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 26.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 16.1 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 8.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 38.6%, which is above Factset Research's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Factset Research, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide is flanked by a margin of safety, within which we feel shares are fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $129 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Factset Research. We think the firm is attractive below $103 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $155 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Factset Research's fair value at this point in time to be about $129 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Factset Research's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $171 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $129 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpRecent performance has been solid at Factset Research. The firm has an excellent combination of low financial leverage and robust free cash flow generation, resulting in its outstanding dividend prospects. Earnings-per-share growth has been impressive, posting 20 consecutive quarters of double digit growth. We like the firm's research product, but its industry remains highly competitive.Though the company has performed well of late, we are not drawn in by Factset's investment considerations. We feel Mr. Market has overvalued the business. The firm is trading at high earnings multiples and is overvalued on a discounted cash flow basis. At this time, the company registers a 4 on the Valuentum Buying Index.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

3963385,50662,2016-04-05T18:02:41-04:00,"FactSet is meeting my free cash flow expectations and will very likely slightly exceed them on a full-year basis.The entire free cash flow is being spent on the dividend as well as the share repurchases, boosting the FCF/share.Thanks to the recent weakness in the share price, the free cash flow yield has increased to 4%.","Sometimes boring companies can be the best investments, as they aren't subject to huge volatility at the top or bottom line. In the past, I was a little bit underwhelmed by FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS) because the company's free cash flow yield was pretty low. As the company has now released its financial results of the second quarter and the first semester of the financial year 2016, I think it's a good time to revisit the company and to find out if I need to update my expectations.FDS data by YChartsThe organic growth rate in the second quarter was impressiveFactSet Research had an excellent second quarter of the year as its revenue increased by 13.7% to $281.8 million. An increase of almost 14% is very remarkable, but what's even more important is that the organic revenue increased by 9.5%, indicating that the growth rate by external factors like the foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions only contributed 4% to the top line increase. This is an excellent result and it allowed the company to boost its total six-month revenue by in excess of 10% to $552 million.Source: SEC filingsLet's focus on the most recent quarter for a minute. It was nice to see the revenue increase by almost 14%, but shareholders and investors should keep in mind that the total operating expenses also increased sharply to almost $197 million resulting in an operating income of $85 million. That's still an excellent result but the effect of the high revenue on the operating income was less outspoken as the operating income increased by just 6% (vs. 13.7%). This caused the operating margin to decrease from 32.5% to a little bit in excess of 30% in the second quarter of the financial year 2016. The total net income increased by approximately 10% to $67.8 million bringing the net income for the first half of the year to almost $128 million. Thanks to the reduced share count due to the ongoing share buyback program, the EPS increased by approximately 10% to $3.06 per share.In my most recent article about FactSet Research, I said I was expecting the company to generate a positive free cash flow of approximately $250 million in the financial year 2016. That's a pretty decent amount of money, but as the company was trading at a market capitalization of approximately $7 billion, I wasn't really too impressed. However, as market cap has now decreased to just a little bit over $6 billion, I wanted to revisit my free cash flow targets to find out if the company has become more appealing.Source: SEC filingsAt first sight, the operating cash flow has improved tremendously considering it increased from $121 million to $164 million. However, this does take some changes in the company's working capital position into account, and if you would isolate these changes from the equation, the adjusted operating cash flow would have been approximately $151 million. Considering the company's capital expenditures remained relatively low at $26 million (which is just 5% of the total revenue in the corresponding period), the company generated an adjusted free cash flow of approximately $125 million in the first half of the year which basically means the company is on track to generate a quarter of a billion in free cash flow in the current financial year.The company has increased its buyback rateGenerating $250 million on an annualized basis in free cash flow is a great achievement for a company, but the main question investors and shareholders should always ask themselves is whether or not the company is spending its cash wisely.FDS Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YChartsAfter having increased the quarterly dividend by 11% last years, the total cost of the dividend increased to just in excess of $36 million. This would mean FactSet had approximately $90 million left to spend on share buybacks in the first semester of this year, but it looks like the company has spent almost $116 million on buying back its own shares. In the second quarter of the current financial year, the company has repurchased almost half a million shares at an average price of approximately $153 per share, reducing the share count by an additional 1%.FDS Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThis also means the company will very likely end its financial year with less than 41 million shares outstanding. Based on my expectation to see a positive free cash flow of approximately $250 million this year, the company will be generating a free cash flow per share of approximately six dollars. Based on the current share price of just a little bit over $150, FactSet is trading at a free cash flow yield of roughly 4%.Investment thesisAs the company's cash flows have definitely been increasing and the share price has lost approximately 10% since my previous article, FactSet does look a little bit more appealing right now than it used to be half a year ago. However, I'm still not too impressed with the free cash flow yield of approximately 4%. A solution for this could be to write a put option, but due to the relatively low volatility in the company's share price, the option premiums aren't very high either.In order to achieve a minimum free cash flow yield of 5%, one would need to look at writing a put option with a strike price of $120, and it looks like the options expiring in September might be the best choice. You would receive option premium of approximately $1.7, which would result in an annualized return of 2.75% in case you do not get assigned by the shares at the $120."
3666466,50662,2015-11-09T11:45:05-05:00,"Factset reported excellent financial results for FY 2015 with another revenue, net profit and cash flow increase.The acquisition and integration of Portware will be interesting, as there isn't a lot of data to rely on.I would expect Factset's high single-digit revenue growth rate to continue and am aiming for an adjusted free cash flow of in excess of $250M.I personally require higher (FCF-based) returns, but can understand why someone would like to add Factset to its portfolio as a 'defensive' stock with a robust balance sheet.","IntroductionAlmost five months ago, I wrote an article about Factset Research (NYSE:FDS) concluding the company was a little bit too expensive for me. Even though Factset is most definitely free cash flow positive, the free cash flow yield was a bit too low to lure me into taking a position.FDS data by YChartsSince that first article, Factset has released its annual report and it closed an acquisition with a total value of in excess of a quarter of a billion dollar and in this article I will try to find out whether or not I need to update my expectations.Reviewing the 2015 financial resultsAs expected, Factset was once again able to increase its revenue which reached $1.007B (up from $920M in 2014 and $858M in 2013) so the company's remarkable growth trajectory remains intact. After deducting the operating expenses, Factset was able to report an operating income of $332M in FY 2015, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 32%. That's pretty good, and if you'd compare that operating margin to the results of the previous two financial years, it's interesting to see Factset was able to keep the margin relatively stable (the operating margin was 31.4% in 2013 and 32.8% in 2014).Source: SEC filingsThere were no real surprises as the net income increased by approximately 15% to $241M, but as Factset continues to repurchase shares, the EPS increased by a very handsome 16.5% to $5.80 per common share.As said, Factset is buying back shares to reward its shareholders, and one of the main questions going into 2016 will be to find out what the company's ability to buy back shares will be. That's a question that will need to be investigated from two sides; first of all, I will have to determine how much free cash flow Factset has generated, and what the cost of the total dividend will be for FY2016.Source: SEC filingsIn FY 2015, Factset generated $306.4M in operating cash flow, but as this did include a positive impact from a change in its working capital, I would prefer to work with an 'adjusted' operating cash flow. After ignoring the impact of the working capital change, the adjusted operating cash flow was still very robust at $269M resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $244M in FY 2015. That's a bit less than the $260M I was aiming for in my previous article, but this could be explained by the fact I was underestimating the full-year capex a little bit.After deducting the cash inflow from employees exercising their stock options, Factset repurchased a $185M worth of its common shares whilst the dividend payments cost the company $66.5M. The total amount spent on shareholder rewards was $251.5M, and that's more or less in line with the free cash flow results.How will the newest acquisition impact this year's financial results?After finishing its FY 2015, Factset closed a $265M acquisition of Portware which will contribute $5M in revenue in the current quarter, and likely $10M+ in the next subsequent quarters. There's an additional kicker to this acquisition, as Factset expects to recoup approximately $50M in tax benefits, reducing the effective acquisition cost to $215M on a net basis.Source: company presentationFactset admits one of the main reasons to acquire Portware right now is the company's access to cheap debt. On page 80 of the company's annual report, you can find the credit facility has an interest rate of the Eurodollar rate with a mark-up of just 0.50%, so it was actually a no-brainer to use debt for this acquisition.It's very difficult to try to find out what the effective impact of this acquisition will be, as Factset hasn't really provided a lot of details. However, I would expect the company to be able to generate approximately the same operating margins given the fact that even if the Portware operating margin would be lower, Factset can very likely create some synergy advantages to boost the returns on the acquisition. Additionally, Portware has reported 'explosive growth' in the past three years, so I would hope Portware's revenues will continue to 'explode' higher now it's part of the FactSet group.Investment thesisBased on Factset's growth trajectory in the past few months and the acquisition of Portware which should increase Factset's full-year revenue by at least 3%, I would be surprised if Factset would not be able to increase its free cash flow to in excess of $250-255M (even after taking the slightly higher interest expenses into account).It will be very interesting to see if Factset will prioritize debt repayments over shareholder awards. The dividend (assuming another $0.04 increase in the quarterly dividend from May 2016 on) will cost Factset $76M, leaving $180M available for either share buybacks or retiring some of its outstanding debt.That being said, Factset's expected free cash flow yield is still a bit too low for me, but I absolutely love the company's relatively conservative management style and continuous growth."
3963586,24805,2016-04-06T13:55:38-04:00,"With reasonable PE ratio and a justifiable PB ratio, FactSet might not be overvalued after all.Strong financials with solid cash inflow from operations make FactSet a favorite.With the regular acquisitions and share buybacks, FactSet looks good for investors.","What caught my attention about FactSet Research System (NYSE:FDS) is the graph below.In the last 5 years, FactSet grew 43.45% while the NYSE Financial Sector Index grew 44.60%. This got me thinking.With the current PE ratio of 25.88, which is almost in line with that of Morningstar's (NASDAQ:MORN) 29.11, Thomson Reuter's (NYSE:TRI) 25.05 and McGraw Hill Financial's (NYSE:MHFI) 22.91, why is the Price-to-Book ratio so high for FactSet?Well, there are two factors that are acting behind that high P/B ratio.Increasing ROE margin - FactSet's ROE has gone up to 45.35% in 2015 from 33.20% in 2011.In comparison to that, Thomson Reuters' and Morningstar's ROE stand at 9.50% and 20.50% respectively. (Only McGraw Hill Financial's ROE stands at a crazy margin of around 340%, partly due to its huge share buybacks of $974 million in 2015.)It must be remembered that when investors expect higher ROE over time, the price tends to overshadow the book value.Consistent Share Buybacks - Last year, FactSet bought back $256 million worth of stocks. And this has been a regular affair for FactSet. If you look at the image below, you will see that although the amount of shares bought back have not been too large, it has been pretty constant.What that does is, it lowers the book value, and thus, the P/B ratio goes up. But that is not necessarily a bad thing though. It keeps the price level constant, and also lets the company be able to provide return to shareholders in a not-so-dynamic market like this.So, looking at the two criteria above, it can be said that the P/B ratio might be justified.Now that we know that the company might not be overvalued after all, our next question is, ""Should you buy it?""Well, let's look at 5 important metrics before taking any decision.Strong Revenue Growth - Crossing the ""billion mark"" in revenue in 2015, FactSet's Q-o-Q revenue growth has been astounding compared to its competitors.Last year, FactSet's revenue grew at 9.39%, much higher against McGraw Hill Financial's 5.19% and Morningstar's 3.78%. (Thomson Reuter's 2015 sales revenue growth stood at 12.18%).Will this continue in future? To be honest, the financial market is teetering at present. With Europe still under recovery, China struggling with slowing GDP growth and declining demographic trend, Emerging Market slowdown due to financial stress and low productivity and low labor participation in United States, the financial industry still needs some time to get back to pre-recession activity levels.However, I am hopeful that financial information industry will still flourish, provided the companies work to change their business model according to what the time needs. New solutions must be developed to meet new problems. For example, at just over 6.75%, Risk & Compliance users and Investment Bankers or Corporate Financiers have been the fastest growing customer groups the past five years, according to a report by Burton-Taylor International Consulting, LLC last year. Pricing, Reference & Valuation products have shown the greatest increase in demand, with an average of 8.88% per year over the same period. Expected at above $25 billion in market size and around $7 billion in revenue, there is a lot of opportunity I believe. That leads us to the question, ""What is FactSet doing about it?""String Of Acquisitions - Since 2010, FactSet has been in a very aggressive mode. In June 2010, FactSet acquires Market Metrics, Inc., the leading market research firm in the United States focused on advisor-sold investments and insurance products. In July 2012, FactSet acquires StreetAccount for better distilled company news and market summaries. In September 2013, FactSet acquires Revere Data to get a better understanding of companies and how they fit into the global economy. In February 2014, FactSet acquires Matrix Solutions to offer even more intelligence to the UK financial services industry. In February 2015, FactSet acquires Code Red, which aids it to offer an RMS for all its clients' workflows. In September 2015, FactSet acquires Portware to offer include multi-asset trade automation.If you ask me, I see a more all-rounded package of quality products and solutions that covers a wider range of investor needs. It translates into higher annual subscription value, which was recorded $29.8 million last quarter against $25.4 million in the same period a year ago. (Although incremental changes from acquisitions are factored in, they count for a nominal percentage in the numbers.)Will we see this growth in future? Only time will tell. Phil Snow, CEO of FactSet says:It must be noted that user count grew 10.6% to 63,500, accounting for 331 net new users, and client count climbed up by 51 to 3,057, as recorded on February 29, 2016.Strong Fundamentals With Good Cash Inflow - Although FactSet's COGS have been increasing at a higher rate than its revenue, its last recorded operating margin stands at 32.97%, much higher than Thomson Reuters' 14.20% and Morningstar's 24.16%.However, I must add that COGS growth rate must be tackled so that it does not creep into the bottom line further.With long-term debt standing at a mere $35 million, FactSet's total debt to equity ratio is recorded at 6.58, compared to Thomson Reuters' 68.36, Morningstar's 5.47 and McGraw Hill Financial's astounding 1861.34.What impresses me is the steady cash inflow from operations, jumping up sharply to $306. 44 in 2015 from $231.97 in 2012.With a high cash flow to capex ratio and a current ratio of over 2, compared to Thomson Reuters' 0.66, Morningstar's 1.35 and McGraw Hill Financial's astounding 1.13, FactSet should not face a liquidity crisis if any good opportunity comes by.High return on average assets of 34.44% shows that FactSet is managing its assets well in this tough industry conditions. When it comes to market risk, FactSet boasts of a beta of 0.74 - looks pretty safe to me.Alpha ConclusionTo be honest, FactSet, as a company, looks pretty investment-worthy to me, with the strong financials, regular business acquisitions and generous shareholder returns. But considering the current volatile market conditions, and especially the financial industry, I will suggest not jumping right now, but putting the stock on your watchlist at the moment. Remember, if market factors become favorable, this is a company you should watch for."
4057514,102938,2017-03-23T13:57:58-04:00,"Demand for financial data services has been increasing and is projected to continue with growth at similar levels as a result of technological innovation in the finance industry.Despite past market uncertainty and volatility, FactSet has been able to maintain an increasing revenue growth rate by providing a price-competitive and diverse range of services.Increasing interest rates and bullish market will lead to more funds and thus increase both buy-side and sell-side clients.FactSet has been able to maintain a high client retention rate. For the past two years, this figure has been over 94%.FactSet has a low P/E ratio in comparison to the industry average.","By Elaine Kim, Hannah Koschmeder, Rui Hui and Youce Ji. IntroductionFactSet Research Systems (NYSE: FDS) is one of the top three financial data service providers in the data services industry. They collect financial data from over 1,500 sources, package it into useful tools, and sell a subscription to their services. The stock in currently trading at $177. We recommend a long position for this stock due to the bullish outlook of the market, improving technology in the finance industry, the impact of increasing interest rates on FactSet's clients, and FactSet's competitive pricing.Advantage: Inherent Increasing DemandDespite slow growth and low interest rates since the recession, demand for financial data and analysis has increased.Approximately 86.4% of FactSet's revenues are derived from buy-side investment management clients whereas the sell-side makes up approximately 17.4% of its revenues. One of the company's main risks is the uncertainty in the asset management industry. Investment failures will lower the confidence in the market and in turn decrease the demand for FactSet's services. Furthermore, consolidation would decrease the number of FactSet's clients.Despite the fluctuation in the performance of FactSet's clients, FactSet has been able to maintain steady growth. This speaks to the quality of and robust demand for FactSet's services. As the outlook for some of FactSet's clients remains optimistic, the case for going long FactSet is all the more convincing.Furthermore, improvements in technology, innovation and increasing technological adoption in the financial industry will drive up the demand for high-quality data and the tools to extract knowledge, which are provided by FactSet. The 2017 Data and Analytics Report by MIT Sloan Management Review finds that ""the percentage of companies deriving competitive advantage"" from data analytics has increased for the first time in four years, and that ""innovation from analytics is surging."" Since, as innovation increases, demand for more data analysis will follow, there is a positive feedback loop between improvements in technology in the finance industry and the value of data analysis services, which suggests a long-term increasing value of and demand for FDS services.Advantage: Bull Market Increases Investors and Investment, Increasing DemandA long position for FactSet also is supported by the bull market. A bullish market contributes to FactSet's revenue growth as the number of investors and the amount of funds increase, leading to an increasing demand for financial data services from both buy- and sell-side clients.Since the election of President Trump in November, the market has undergone a continuous rally - the S&P 500 index has gone up by 6.4% since the beginning of 2017. The market is presenting a bullish outlook as Trump's administration promised higher government expenditures on infrastructure and more jobs for U.S. workers. Also, the proposed tax cut plan is giving investors more confidence in corporate profitability. There are several phenomena and numbers that indicate further growth in the stock market.Copper price has been a good indicator of the global market activity and economic growth because of its continuous high demand from a variety of industries. A strengthening global economy will lead to high demand for copper and result in its price hike. As the price of copper has risen 5.6% since the beginning of 2017, one can sense a world-wide revival of industrial activities, not only in emerging markets and China but also in America, where according to Trump, more factories will be built. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a stronger performance from the global economy.The worldwide low level interest rate is driving money into investments rather than saving accounts as borrowing becomes cheap. For instance, China has lowered its interest rate from 6% to 4.35% in the past two years while Europe has lowered it to 0% (Source: Tradingeconomics). These fiscal decisions result in an increase in the aggregate amount of investment and borrowing. For America, despite the highly anticipated interest rate hikes in 2017, the real federal fund rates, calculated by subtracting GDP inflation from the policy rate, land at -1.75% last month. This negative rate suggests that people should be spending and borrowing more instead of putting money in their savings' accounts. Moreover, the Goldman Sachs Financial Condition Index's current movement also is worth noting as below:(Source: Wall Street Journal) (Source: Nasdaq.com)This index measures the ease of raising capital and the current low figure suggests that money is easy to borrow. Furthermore, this indicates an imminent influx of credit in the market as well as global investment activities. Consequently, this bullish outlook with more market activities in the future will increase the demand for research as more investors and more capital are entering the market, leading to revenue growth for FactSet.FactSet's acquisition streak makes the case all the stronger. Major acquisitions in the past two years include Portware, CYMBA Technologies, and Vermilion Software. In January 2017, FactSet announced an agreement to acquire Interactive Data Management Solutions from Intercontinental Exchange. With these acquisitions, FactSet has garnered a tremendous amount of potential to expand and empower its product offerings. The growth in the past three years despite the volatile environment attests to this. Going forward, FactSet is well positioned to enhance its services and outperform its competitors.Competitors: Market Conditions and Competitive AdvantagesA major uncertainty for FactSet is the competition they face from Bloomberg LP, which has a market share of 34.1%, and Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), which has a share of 29.9%. In comparison, FactSet has a market share of 6.6%. These three companies make up almost three quarters of the market share, and in 2016 made a total of 1.1 billion in revenues. Although each company packages the data differently, all create revenues through subscriptions to their products and services.Industry competition is increasing due to an increasing demand for data services and moderate barriers to entry, which creates smaller, niche entrants. This trend caused Reuters to lose significant market share of 3.8% in 2011. Additionally, because it is a highly skilled industry, and there is a greater demand for skilled labor than there is supply, the industry faces high labor costs.Among its two major competitors, Bloomberg is the only private company, while FactSet and Thomson Reuters are public. This allows Bloomberg to take on more risks with their operation. However, their prices are often steep for smaller investment firms and these extra services can be omitted without detriment, giving FactSet an advantage.Advantage: Competitive Pricing Strategy and High ROICDue to the similarity in the services and concentrated market share, FactSet and its main competitors, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, compete on price and quality. FactSet is able to provide quality services at a lower price because it does not depend on a single resource for the data, which allows FactSet to keep its operational costs lower by creating competition between its suppliers. FactSet features a competitive pricing scheme with similar quality as their competitors. FactSet offers a subscription to its service for $12,000 per year. In comparison, Bloomberg offers subscription to each terminal for $24,000 per year, and Thomson Reuters offers a-la-carte services that can also run up to $24,000 per year.FactSet's revenues and market share have steadily increased for the past few years despite the slow growth of the market since the recession. This trend is mainly due to FactSet's strong pricing power as a result of high switching costs and high customer loyalty, shown through a customer retention rate greater than 94%. Moreover, with an annual subscription system rather than a one-time payment, the company is able to achieve growth without investing heavily in client acquisition. FactSet's consequent high profitability is reflected through the return on invested capital (ROIC) ratio as below:The graph shows that FactSet's ROIC is more than double its competitors. This explains FactSet's growth during poor market performance, and even in spite of a correlation between FactSet's success and its client's success. When the market is not performing well, investors and institutions tend to reduce spending on research facilities and as a result they will turn to cheaper options. Even though FactSet is still subject to negative effects from the market, its affordable products and high operating margin will protect the company's revenue.Additional Risks: Data Breaches and Changes in RegulationsData security poses a continuous risk for FactSet due to the large volumes of confidential data that FactSet receives from its clients. Any security breach could adversely impact FactSet's reputation and performance.Changes in regulation may both benefit and suffer from changes in regulation. On one hand, decreased regulation on financial markets could decrease the demand for FactSet's services. Since the 2008 recession, there has been a push for stronger financial regulations, which has been beneficial to demand for data service providers like FactSet. Due to the increasing need in the finance industry for assistance with disclosure requirements, financial institutions are increasingly outsourcing data research to service companies like FactSet. Even though more regulation can increase the number of clients, regulation also puts ""pressure on prices,"" not necessarily leading to higher revenue.Simultaneously, the new president has been supportive of the deregulation of financial institutions, including promises to repeal Dodd-Frank. These promises, if carried out, and this attitude of deregulation may decrease the uncertainty in the investment banking industry, FactSet's largest subset of clients, and therefore increase demand, but also may put pressure on prices of services.Conclusion: Long PositionA long position in FactSet will reward investors for several reasons. First, although the company has experienced a rise in its stock price, its P/E ratio is currently at 21 while the industry average is around 30, and its main competitor at this stage, Thomson Reuters, is at 31. Thus, there is much room for price increases. Second, FactSet's high ROIC, competitive pricing and ROE suggest that this is a profitable company with more potential growth in its businesses. Finally, increasing interest rates and bullish market will lead to more funds and more of both buy-side and sell-side clients in the market. Combined with improving technological innovation in the finance industry, these will result in higher demand and revenues for FactSet."

Although only currently valued at $5bn, FDS is creating a moat right before our eyes: they have tremendous depth and breadth in their proprietary research databases, scalable global technology platforms, state-of-the art workstations with improved analytics and fully flexible and customizable infrastructure which makes them adaptable to any client needs.The company also is rolling out Project NextGen where they are introducing faster, leaner and more agile database computing by minimizing the size of their servers. The company centralizes their capital allocation and makes big acquisition bets. In fact, they were criticized in 2005 since they made ""$92 million in acquisitions yet only had $72 million in net income"" that year. However, these bets have assisted the company in continuing to provide world-class service to its customers while at the same time being at the forefront of innovative content (their most recent acquisition of Revere Data analyzes supply chain relationship data in global trade). The proof is in the pudding: the company has over 90% client retention ratio while maintaining a very healthy 32.7% operating margin. However, the company is fairly valued. Its forward P/E is at 25.25 and its PEG is over 2.5, meaning the market is giving the company a healthy premium. This could indicate major volatility during market downturns and with expectations so high in an extremely competitive market, any miss could pummel the stock.Ultimately, FDS is becoming the one-stop-platform for client information needs and is transforming the way information is being consumed. This automatically places the company into the high-end market with fewer players since smaller niche companies cannot compete with the innovation and analytic depth that FactSet provides to banking and asset management clients. This puts them more in competition with the Thomson Reuters and Bloombergs of the world rather than the Morningstars or MSCIs of the world. As a result, I do not see how the $6.49bn FDS, with its innovative culture, deep, scalable platform and large investments in innovative technologies and content can remain at its current market cap, barring a macro-economic collapse. Bloomberg and Thomson are double-digit, billion-dollar companies and with FDS' vision of over $1 billion in subscriptions and supreme focus on financial information, the company is a double-digit, billion-dollar entity over the nextfive years. Based on our proprietary models, the one-year price target on the company is at $175.56, three years at $221.35."
2225603,52852,2014-05-19T11:28:27-04:00,"This article demonstrates the correct way to value FDS, using a very simple valuation model.FDS is a great high growth company, but the stock seems fairly valued.Investors should focus on hidden growth opportunities over the next 5 to 10 years.","Recently, a SeekingAlpha writer published a bullish article on FactSet (NYSE:FDS). While I respect the author's honest effort, I believe there are several issues with the article's central arguments that should be addressed for the benefit for the amateur investment community. My goal with this article is not to specifically address the above mentioned article (which, by the way, you do not need to read), but to offer what I believe are the key factors that the market cares about as it relates to FDS and how investors should think about the company's valuation.In my opinion, one of the most common errors made by amateur investors is the lack of respect for how efficient U.S. equity markets actually are. For companies with a market capitalization of $1 billion+, fundamental data and key ratios are widely available and understood by the professional investment community. Thus, valuation models that use widely understood and expected numbers as inputs should yield an estimated value that is roughly in line with the company's actual valuation. If the two numbers are grossly different, then one should exam whether one's input assumptions are materially different (and if it is, justify it) or whether the model being applied is simply inappropriate. All too often, amateur investors apply the wrong valuation model.Let's examine one of the simplest - but effective - valuation models in my arsenal. Let's call this model the 3 Factor Discounted Cash Flow Model. This model is simple and easy to use, and is most effective for generating a quick understanding of a company's valuation by focusing on three key factors: revenue growth assumption, operating income growth assumption, and historical valuation.FDS's TTM Revenue and Operating Income ($MM)Without a doubt, FDS has generated some very strong growths. Taking the 3-year moving average, FDS grew revenue by 10% in FY13, which is the fastest growth since 2008. Prior to the financial crisis, the company grew revenues between 12.1% to 23.5%, but in those days the company had a much smaller revenue base to work with. For our model, we assume a revenue growth of 10% per year for the next 5 years.Also looking at the 3-year moving average, operating margins have been pretty steady over the past decade at around 33%, plus or minus 1%. For the last 3-year average, operating margin stood at 32.7%, which is the number that we will use for our model.For historical valuation, we will use enterprise value over operating income - this is very close to the classic EV/EBIT multiple, so we will just call it that. Looking at the EV/EBIT for at quarterly intervals since Feb. 1996, the company's median EV/EBIT is 15.6 with a standard deviation of 4. Since current EV/EBIT stands at around 15, we will use this number in our model.As of 2/28/2014, the company is paying out approximately $60 million in dividends per year. We will not use historical dividend growth rates since the dividend payout ratio has nearly doubled over the past decade to 29.5%. We will assume dividends will grow in line with revenue at 10%.For the discount rate, we will apply a very generous if not discretionary 10%.Using our revenue growth assumption of 10% for the next 5 years and applying an operating margin of 32.7%, we arrive at an operating income of $451 million by 2018. Assuming we sell FDS as a multiple of 15 EV/EBIT, we arrive at a market value of $6.77 billion. Over the next 5 years, we will also collect dividends of $403 million. Discounting our annual dividends and final sale price at 10%, we arrive at a NPV of $4.505 billion, which is nearly exactly the current market capitalization of $4.46 billion with a variance of 1%. Note that I did not fudge the numbers to arrive at this estimate - I simply did what I normally do and arrived at the market value.If you use an inappropriate valuation model, you may get a wildly different value from market value. For example - and not to pick on the author - the valuation model the above mentioned author used to value FDS is an completely inappropriate perpetual discount model that essentially assumes that free cash flow will be distributed out every year and, even after distributing all free cash flow, the company is still able to generate its historical growth of 12%. This, of course, is wildly different from the actual distributed cash of approximately $60 million.Amateur investors may use my 3 Factor DCF model presented above as a starting point. If the result is grossly different from the current market value, then one should dig deep to understand the key factors the market is using to value the stock. In addition, one should further understand the company to make adjustments to the simple 3 Factor DCF model. Normally, without evidence to the contrary, a company's revenue and margin growth should not dramatically change from the status quo over the next 5 years. One should also be realistic around cash-to-cash returns (how much you pay, how much you actually receive in return) instead of relying on highly theoretical numbers such as FCF.In the comment section below, let me you know if you believe FDS' revenue or margins will change materially in the future and why you believe so.

2514265,25120,2014-09-23T05:44:52-04:00,"FactSet Research posts solid results, issues a healthy outlook.
        Long term profitable growth track record is impressive, yet it has resulted in a premium valuation.
        This limits the risk-reward appeal at this point in my eyes, making me a buyer on a 15-20% correction.","Investors in FactSet Research (FDS) have not been pleased with a fourth quarter earnings report and accompanied outlook which was largely in line with consensus estimates.Despite the fair results and great long term trajectory, the recent momentum and overall premium valuation limits the risk-reward appeal at this point in my eyes. As such I remain cautious, awaiting the sidelines, being a buyer in the $100 region.Fourth Quarter HighlightsFactSet posted fourth quarter sales of $238.7 million, a 8.8% increase compared to the year before. Reported sales looked favorable compared to consensus estimates at $237.0 million and the company's own guidance for sales of $235 to $240 million.Reported GAAP earnings were up by 6.9% towards $55.4 million as share repurchases resulted in accelerated earnings growth on a per share basis.Reported earnings per share improved by thirteen cents towards $1.31 for the quarter. Earnings were largely in line with the own guidance of $1.30 to $1.32 per share, and consensus estimates at $1.30 per share.Solid Operating PerformanceThe company was pleased with the performance for the quarter citing that it added 2,000 net new users, marking the highest level of new clients since 2005. In total the company now has 54,596 professionals using FactSet's workstations, divided over some 2,743 clients.Proud CEO Philip Hadley noted that the past fiscal year marked the 34th year in a row in which FactSet has posted revenue growth on an annual basis.The current rate of annual subscription value rose by 7.3% towards $963.6 million at the moment, driven by increased buy side activity in particular. Acquisitions added a modest $3.7 million in quarterly revenues, with the vast majority of growth being of an organic nature.Reported operating earnings totaled 33.3% of sales, a 110 basis points increase versus last year. This was mainly the result of strong cost discipline with selling, general and administrative costs actually being down by $1.8 million towards $66.8 million.Net earnings growth was slower than reported sales growth on the back of higher effective tax rates due to the impact of R&D tax credit maturities.First Quarter OutlookFor the current first quarter, FactSet anticipates revenues of $240 to $243 million, which implies that sales are seen up by 8.3% at the midpoint of the guided range.Earnings on a diluted basis are seen between $1.31 and $1.33 per share with the lapse of the R&D tax credit hurting earnings per share by two cents on a sequential basis. This compares to last year's reported earnings of $1.19 per share.The outlook was largely in line with consensus estimates calling for earnings of $1.34 per share on sales of $241 million.Solid Balance Sheet, Premium ValuationFactSet had little over 42 million shares outstanding at he end of the quarter, valuing equity in the business at $5.2 billion at $124 per share. Note that the business holds little over $136 million in cash and equivalents while not having any debt outstanding, which values operating assets just North of $5.0 billion.On a trailing basis, FactSet has now posted sales of $920 million on which it posted earnings of $211 million. This implies a valuation of operating assets at about 5.5 times annual revenues and around 24 times earnings.History Of Growth, Aided By RepurchasesFactSet has demonstrated very impressive and steady growth in its operations over the past decade. Between 2005 and the current moment, FactSet has tripled its operations from $300 million to little over $900 million in sales, growing sales at closely 12% per annum on average.Earnings have grown at a similar pace as the business retired roughly 15% of its shares outstanding over this time period as well, only adding to reported growth on a per share basis.Investors have been able to participate into these operational gains as well as shares have steadily risen over the past decade. Note that shares traded only at around $25 in 2005 having steadily risen over time before breaching the $100 mark in 2011 already.Final TakeawayShares of FactSet Research have seen a fair bit of momentum in recent times, with shares being up 15% so far this year driven by strong momentum since the start of June. At the time shares were still trading in a $105-$110 range, only to quickly rise to highs of $130 recently.While these returns have been nice they have limited the short to medium term appeal in my eyes with shares trading around 24 times earnings after backing out net cash holdings. This comes at a time when the overall market trades around 17 times earnings. Given the strong balance sheet, the company could incur upto a billion in debt in my eyes to speed up repurchases, retiring another 8 million shares or nearly a fifth of the outstanding share base.Yet I think it is wise of management to not lever up quickly, but maintain a lot of balance sheet flexibility. Still, the overall valuation is a bit high despite this strong financial flexibility and impeccable track record in profitably growing the business, while slowly repurchasing shares.At 24 times earnings the real risk-reward appeal is gone, yet I do find that shares would deserve a 10% premium versus the market given the financial position and the track record of profitable and sticky growth. This translates into a roughly $100 price entry target, levels which we will most likely not see anytime soon for now unfortunately."
2773505,25120,2014-12-23T14:48:19-05:00,"Factset Research continues its path of steady growth.This steady growth and predictable cash flows result from high retention rates, which in turn warrants a premium valuation.Yet after the 30% momentum seen this year, shares trade at 27 times earnings, which is simply too much.As a result, I am not willing to pay at current levels for this high-quality name.","Investors in Factset Research (NYSE:FDS) have enjoyed a great momentum ride so far this year, on the back of excellent operational performance.A solid first quarter performance of the financial information provider added to the momentum in its shares, which have consequently risen to fresh all-time highs. After the great momentum seen in the shares this year, and the premium valuation resulting from this jump in the share price, I am not considering picking up some shares in this quality name at the moment as a result of valuation concerns.Solid Start To 2015Factset reported an 8.8% jump in first quarter sales, which came in at $242.7 million. The performance in terms of sales has been very healthy as growth was predominately organic with acquisitions adding just $2.5 million in quarterly sales. Reported revenues came in a million above analysts' expectations.The so-called annual subscription value rose by 8.5% as the overall annual subscription revenues now come in at a rate of $970.2 million. The reported growth was driven by both domestic and foreign activities, with US revenues increasing by 7.0% to $163.7 million as foreign sales were up 9.8% to $79.0 million.In terms of operations, the total client number rose by just 19 to 2,762 companies. This quarter is typically soft in terms of new client gains, with many banks and financial institutions closing their books at this point in the year.The user base grew much quicker, being up 9.0% to 55,593 user accounts. The company stressed in the conference call that Factset added nearly a 1,000 accounts during the quarter. This means that an average user subscription costs up to $4,400 for a three-month period, a substantial amount, of course. Users are clearly pleased with Factset's service, with retention levels increasing above 95%.The company serves the wider financial industry including the buy and sell-side business, including investment management, hedge funds, investment banking, wealth management, private equity, sales and pension agencies, among others. These financial professionals use Factset's solutions to analyze deals, check out the market, analyze fixed income instruments, and manage risk, while workflow tools are used for news flow, screening, research management and instant messaging.The solid growth in terms of topline sales did not one-to-one translate into higher earnings. Operating earnings rose by 7.4%, thereby trailing topline sales growth as operating margins of 33.1% were down some 40 basis points versus last year. Despite the limited 7.1% jump in net earnings to $55.9 million, investors were able to enjoy double-digit earnings per share growth as earnings were up by 11.9% to $1.32 per share. Analysts had anticipated that earnings would come in a penny higher.Second Quarter ViewFor the upcoming second quarter, Factset sees revenues coming in at $244 million to $248 million. At the midpoint of the guidance, sales are seen rising 1.4% on a sequential basis, and up 8.4% on an annual basis, roughly in line with the reported growth rate on an annual basis in the first quarter.Earnings are seen between $1.35 and $1.37 per share on a diluted basis. Growth in earnings is relatively solid, with earnings seen up four cents on a sequential basis and up 12% on an annual basis.Steep Valuation, High-Quality Balance SheetFactset continues to operate with a very strong balance sheet, which contains $140 million in cash and equivalents as the company has no debt outstanding. Combined with steady growth and predictable cash flows resulting from the high retention rates of its is workstations, this results in a very comfortable financial position. Based on the underlying business strength, Factset could easily support a billion in debt on its balance sheet.With 42 million shares outstanding, trading at around $142 million, Factset is valued at close to $6.0 billion. Backing out the net cash position, the valuation come in close to $5.8 billion.Based on the performance over the past twelve months, Factset reported revenues of $940 million, EBITDA of $342 million and earnings of $215 million. This values the equity of the company at 6.2 times sales, 17 times EBITDA and a premium 27 times earnings multiple.Steady And Predictable GrowthFactset has grown the business in a very steady and predictable manner over the past decade, although the pace of growth has slowed a bit over time. Since 2005, the company has tripled its sales from $313 million to $940 million currently, growing sales at roughly 11%-12% per year on average.The company has seen quite a bit of gross margin compression, with margins falling from 70% in 2005 to roughly 61% at the moment. Operating margins came in between 30%-35% over this time period, currently coming in at the middle of that range. These stable margins and the fact that the company bought back 15%-20% of its shares over this time period, added significantly to earnings per share growth.The growth seen over the past decade builds on the achievements the company has made since being founded in 1978. Factset has now grown its sales 34 years in a row, which is an impressive achievement given that the world has seen quite a few financial crises ever since. This sales growth has resulted in the fact that Factset has been able to report earnings growth in each year since going public in 1996.Thoughts For InvestorsFactset has turned out to be a great and steady value-creating company for its shareholders. Shares rose from $35 in 2005 to double to levels around $70 ahead of the financial crisis. Following the crisis, shares fell back to $35 as investors worried that massive job cuts in the financial sector would hit Factset's revenues, which did not turn out to be true.Shares quickly recovered to reach the $100 mark by the start of 2011, and fluctuated around that level until the spring of this year. Following a few decent earnings reports and the momentum seen ever since, shares have risen to fresh highs around $140 at the current moment.That said, this kind of quality represented by steady operational growth, a growing dividend (that only yields 1.1% by the way), and consistent share repurchases, comes at a price. At current levels, shares trade around 27 times earnings, which is roughly a 50% premium versus the wider market, on the back of a strong track record in operational growth.That premium valuation and the 30% returns witnessed this year leave little appeal in my eyes, with operational growth coming in at the high single-digits. A 27 times earnings multiple is way too much in my opinion. A 20 times multiple is the maximum I am willing to pay. This multiple reflects a 10%-15% premium versus the wider market, which seems fair given the capital-light business model, the consistent and high pace of organic growth. Adding in the net cash holdings of the business, this translates to a $110 targeted entry point, which makes me very cautious at current levels."

However, to financial professionals, FDS is an essential ingredient in their daily work. The company provides financial and global economic data to investment professionals, mostly in the analysis of the $150 Trillion bond market.Revenues To GrowAccording to a recent S&P report, FDS revenues are expected to grow at 6.3% due to an increased customer base and increased use of their software platform on mobile devices.Healthy Operating MarginIn FY13 operating margin was 31%. During FY14 this should increase to 33%, near the previous high of 34% which was achieved in FY12.From An Investor's PerspectiveFDS's annual client retention rate is approximately 92%, which is telling of how important their services are to their clients. The high retention rate also acts as an important barrier to entry for competitors and provides a solid foundation for future growth.Considering the recent sell-off, this is a unique opportunity for investors to add a quality company at an attractive valuation.FDS is one of the Top 25 stocks among Purple Chip stocks because of its history of producing steady, predictable and growing earnings. Among the thousands of companies in the stock market, few come close to the solid earnings growth that FDS has produced over the last 17 years.Some Important ConsiderationsConclusionBased on historical valuation ranges, the Purple Chips target for FDS is $123.00 in 12-18 months and according to First Call, the average analyst target is $111.00.Few public companies have an earnings record like FDS. Investors should take advantage of the current sell-off to accumulate shares.

2155953,32101,2014-04-24T05:00:00-04:00,Ridiculous TTM ROA of 30% on a recurring high cash flow business model.Large share repurchases will help to compound the value attributable to common shareholders.Modest growth -- which seems highly probable -- will provide an investor with a satisfactory return in a great business.,"There are at least two types of value stocks: (1) stocks whose probable growth makes them intelligent investments and (2) stocks which, even under conditions of stagnation, sell at valuations enabling the investor to earn a strong return. In the former type, which is typically called GARP or ""growth at reasonable prices,"" the company just keeps on giving year after year. In the latter type, the value disparity is somewhat of a one-off opportunity. This is similar to the ""good business versus cigar-butt"" or the ""patient value versus courageous value"" dichotomy.In the former case, you conservatively assume some growth because the intrinsic value is growing year by year. In cases where the fair value is pretty constant, you buy, say, when you think the stock is selling 75%+ below that figure.Here we are looking at FactSet (NYSE:FDS) as a GARP stock. As Martin Vlcek titled one of his articles, we are talking about ""utility-like"" benefits with much better growth possibilities. We can also analogize that consumer barriers to exit are similar to those of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office or being a part of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem.Over the last ten years, FDS has increased consolidated net income by 10% per annum. It has increased revenues by 9.5% per annum. If we talk about free cash flow, in many cases the best measure of earnings, it has grown by 12% per annum over the last decade. Furthermore, as the 10-K puts it:Given this superb track record, it is highly unlikely this company would sport an earnings yield (or free-cash-flow yield) of greater than 8%. That is basically what we see historically:And if you notice, it is selling at attractive valuations today. Sure, it is not the 7% yield sported at the bottom of the financial panic, but it is pretty good in context of its record.OperationsFactSet sells investment data, tools and media to asset managers (81.6% of revenues) with the remainder coming from investment banking firms -- the latter group being in decline in terms of user count.They do just about everything one could ask for as an investment analyst (see pages 22 - 23 of the 10-K for a list of 2013 product enhancements). Furthermore, their products are sold on a subscription basis with month-to-month payments. There are also large amounts of barriers to exit for customers. Once a customer is accustomed to one system -- itself designed to be complete and elegant -- they will naturally be wary of needing to learn a whole new software system. Further, the company interjects itself into the workflow of its customers. The recurring nature of the business creates some forward visibility but the nature of software architecture -- namely, the repeated and habitual use of that software -- helps to create inertia in the customer base. Hence, customers are unlikely to switch providers on a dime.In terms of business performance, FactSet is off the charts. Take a look at its ROA:ROA is a bit of an under-loved metric. Whereas the denominator of the ROE metric can occasionally be flawed due to write-offs of intangibles and goodwill or through returns of equity capital via dividends or buybacks, the denominator of ROA is more difficult to manipulate (although those things just mentioned effect it too - just to a smaller extent).Essentially what the chart above tells us is that FactSet has a much higher return on capital than any of the other companies listed. And keep in mind that ROA's above 10% are pretty rare. If we do a very unscientific analysis using Google Finance's screener, only 1,235 companies out of 23,680 (5.2%) with market caps over $500 million have ROAs above 10%. Only 3% of those companies have an ROA over 15% -- and only 1.45% have ROAs above 25%.FactSet is a very good business in terms of ROA. FactSet also has an extremely conservative balance sheet with no long-term debt capital. Furthermore its current ratio was 2.7 -- despite buying back $332 million of common stock in fiscal 2013 (or about 7.6% of its market cap). Cash represents 28.4% of total assets -- even after the buyback.Now, since the corporation lacks debt capital, its ROA is going to track fairly close to its ROE. Take a look:Anyways, convinced this is a good business yet? Let us also do a little DuPont style analysis. The DuPont analysis -- more rightly called the Frank Donaldson Brown analysis -- is a way of analyzing the components of ROE. At its most simple, it is set up like so:Personally, I like the analysis because it is simply an accounting identity which helps break down the components of ROE. To start, we need our profit margin. FactSet is excellent and quite stable:Asset turnover (called incorrectly, in my opinion, ""asset utilization"" [1] in YCharts) looks great again:And, of course, let us take a look at our leverage or our ""asset multiplier"":In this last case, FactSet is the most conservatively financed and hence the lowest on this metric.Further GrowthWith the stock yielding 6% in free cash flow and looking unlikely to stagnate anytime soon, we are looking at an excellent business at a fair price if it were not going to grow. But, if we take growth into account, we have an attractively priced security.But for us to be able to truly say it is attractively priced, we need a margin of safety. Since we are looking to future growth to appreciate our investment, we need to think about the business' moat. The concept of ""moat"" and the concept of ""margin of safety"" converge when talking about GARP style investments, in my opinion. After outlining how FactSet competes with nearly everyone in their field, the company writes:The competitive advantage just outlined, which I would call a moat, has allowed the company to raise prices annually. Annual price increases are always a good indicator of quality and competitiveness. Furthermore, the company has a measure of forward subscription revenue called ""Annual Subscription Value"" (""ASV"") which has increased in every one of the last ten years and can help forecast future revenues. As of Feb 28, 2014, ASV was $920 million -- an increase of 6% over the prior year, indicating forward revenue growth in the near term.Furthermore, while the competition is fierce from Bloomberg, Bloomberg is the premium product and is somewhat in a tier by itself. FactSet (and its more relevant competition from Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) and McGraw-Hill Financial (MHFI)) gets the benefit of price differentiation. Thomson Reuters has historically had the second greatest market share but has historically had worse customer satisfaction scores compared with FactSet or McGraw-Hill Financial's Capital IQ. Thomson Reuters is attempting to become more competitive and there is some tangible evidence that they are becoming so. As this happens, it could put pressure on FactSet. Yet, that said, FactSet has already been in competition with these players for some time and they have since maintained or improved their market position. The latest change in the industry is the reportedly dramatic improvements made to Thomson Reuter's Eikon. (Check out this small October 2013 comparison of FactSet, Capital IQ and Thomson Reuters. Or see my recent Thomson Reuters article, which contains a link to an Eikon demonstration.)Mathematics of ValuationOn a TTM basis, FactSet has yielded $270 million in distributable cash flow (i.e., free-cash-flow). Assuming stocks are valued according to their distributable cash flow and assuming we think it should be discounted at 15%, we could just do this:But that would be pretty dumb, particularly since there is a high likelihood of growth. As noted above, free-cash-flow has grown at a 12% clip over the last decade. If we naively plug that into our equation above, we get a very different result:Remarkable difference -- although as a matter of practice, it would not be wise to assume the full growth of the past will be applicable to the future. Of course, if we assumed that all market participants wanted a return of 15%, then they would broadly be assuming that future growth is about 8.7%. There is the algebra to get to this number:In the main, however, we consider the proper discount rate to be more closely related to current interest rates, inflation, and the probability of the future turning out as we expect. Probably not a flat 15%.Since FactSet is a very good business, it is worth paying a premium for in terms of discounting future returns. After we discount it, however, we also need to throw in a growth rate. In our opinion, even small growth rates point to undervaluation. E.g., FactSet's $270 million return is highly probable and I would discount it at 8% -- but then if the business grows 4% per annum we would already be talking about a business worth 55% more than the market price. That discount rate is quite appropriate and that growth rate fairly conservative.In other words, I see no reason this business couldn't sell at a PE of 25 given its record, its outstanding return on investment metrics, and its long-term growth potential.Now, I am not trying to make these valuation equations seem too pliable for effective use, but only making the point that if you are starting out with a reasonable assumed discount rate, FDS is a great company selling at a great price. It would be a mistake to discount a business as good as FDS at 15%.But Wait: Share Buy Backs Almost Guarantee A Good ReturnSince 2007 shares outstanding have declined annually, from a share count around 49 million to 43.1 million today. Over the past five years, share count has decreased about 10%, or at about 2.2% per annum. If we make these assumptions:We would then have a corporation which, five years out, would be earning around $327 million -- or a corporation selling at $7.1 billion (a 60% five year gain or 9.8% gain per annum). But, we must take into account share repurchases. Those would leave the share count at around 38.9 million (down from 42.3 million) putting the EPS figures at around $8.40 per share -- at a PE of 22, the around be about $184 per share a 75% five-year gain or a satisfactory 11.7% per year.The tough questions are twofold: (1) will the company continue to sell at a PE of 22 and (2) will the company grow at 6% per annum?The case of #1 basically rests on #2. Take a look at the company's growth history:Things have slowed down dramatically since the financial crisis. Yet, the company has still been able to drive 6.5% top-line growth in the most recent TTM period. Our opinion is that FactSet should be able to drive enough revenue growth through simple annual price increases to maintain their growth over the next five years. This, however, does imply a continued execution in terms of product quality. We believe the likelihood of a continuation of their quality of execution to be fairly good because the corporation has already survived multiple waves of technological change and also because of the unique company culture (also check out Glassdoor).And due to the corporation's history of growth, its valuation has nearly always been above a PE of 20:Given the quality of the business, we view the probability that the company continues to sell at PEs greater than 20 as pretty likely.The downside is also fairly limited by the huge levels of cash thrown off the business. Management clearly views that the stock is undervalued at these levels and declines in the share price would likely be met with large buybacks. We can count on this phenomenon occurring like clockwork, in my opinion, because of the sheer number of stock options granted by the company. Namely, the 4.8 million stock options outstanding -- amounting to about 11% of shares outstanding -- with an average strike price of $82.50. Of those, about half are in the money and have a strike price around $65.27 [2].In face of the company's historic buybacks and its continued incentive to do buybacks, it would be very advantageous for the price to decline -- buybacks would reduce the share count and investors would get a better buying opportunity. This is always a silver lining to price declines at firms which do large buy backs.ConclusionFactSet is a great business: its ROA and ROE are excellent, its business model is recurring, its employees are happy, and its moat increases the more data the company ingests into its products. The demand for financial data is perpetual -- the stock market is perennial and its activity is constant. FactSet, by competing in the lower tier, gets to avoid the dominance of Bloomberg. It also gets price differentiation and has demonstrated its ability to grow market share and its pricing power.Given that the company has already survived the various technological upheavals, we have some evidence of the ability of their company culture to ride the differing waves of technology. The question, in my opinion, is: can the company maintain a 6% earnings growth rate over the next five years? If the reader answers in the affirmative then there is a very good chance of satisfactory price appreciation through the compounding of earnings and share buy backs. If you answer in the negative, the company is fairly valued. We believe, obviously, that there is still a very good chance of price appreciation long-term.Lastly, I leave you with a picture of the stock price over the stocks trading history -- it is beautiful indeed:Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are those of the author as of the date the article was published.

More than 50,000 users stay abreast of global market trends, access extensive company and industry intelligence, and monitor performance with FactSet's desktop analytics, mobile applications, and comprehensive data feeds.STEADY GROWTHFounded in 1978, FactSet Research Systems was started to deliver computer-based financial information to the investment community. Today, FactSet is a leading force within the multibillion dollar financial information industry as they consolidate content from hundreds of databases with powerful analytics and also provide proprietary content. The company's 2,525 clients with 51,000 users can access information from more than 170 data suppliers, 100 exchanges and 90 news sources. Approximately 82% of FactSet's revenues in 2013 came from investment management clients and the remainder from investment banking firms who perform merger and acquisition advisory work and equity research.FactSet has generated steady growth with 33 consecutive years of revenue growth and 17 consecutive years of positive earnings growth as a public company. The company's operating and net margins are also remarkably steady with operating margins having exceeded 31% for 11 consecutive years with net margins hovering in the 23% range. The company has also steadily increased its dividend with eight consecutive years of dividend increases greater than 10%.As FactSet celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2013, the company once again attained record levels of revenues, operating income, net income and EPS as revenues grew 6.5% to $858 million. The company's revenues are derived from subscriptions to services, content and financial applications. The company's annual subscription value (NASDAQ:ASV) was $888 million as of 8/31/13, which represents the forward-looking revenue for the next 12 months from all subscription services supplied to clients.U.S. operations account for 68% of total subscriptions with international subscriptions making up 32% of the total with overall client retention greater than 95% of ASV.GROWING CASH FLOWSFactSet's business generates strong operating cash flows with minimal capital expenditure needs. As a result, free cash flow has grown strongly over the past decade from $39 million to $251 million as of 8/31/13. Management has allocated their growing cash to substantial share repurchases, steadily rising dividends and acquisitions to drive future growth.Over the past five fiscal years, the company has repurchased $1 billion of its shares. The Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $300 million for future share repurchases. The dividend payout has doubled over the last decade from 15% to 30%. With a still relatively low payout, this easily enables the company to provide future dividend increases.STRONG BALANCE SHEETOver the past five years, free cash flow has exceeded net income, which is a sign of high-quality earnings. Thanks to the strong cash flows, the company has been able to operate its business with no long-term debt over the past decade with cash topping $187 million on the company's solid balance sheet as of 11/30/13. This is even after the company spent $15.3 million for the recent acquisition of the assets of Revere Data, LLC, which offers investors a unique way to classify companies and analyze how they fit in the global economy. At the time of the acquisition, Revere had annual subscriptions of $5 million and is expected to dilute FactSet's earnings in fiscal 2014 by $.02 per share. On 12/10/13, FactSet acquired 60% of Matrix Data Limited for 12 million pounds, with the ability to acquire the remaining 40% interest. Matrix's primary line of business is a provider of intelligence to the UK financial services industry. Matrix had $7 million of subscriptions at the time of acquisition. Long-term investors should research FactSet Research Systems, a HI-quality firm with a strong balance sheet and steady growth in sales, earnings, cash flows, dividends and share repurchases.

The American multinational provider of information and analytics to financial service companies has grown in revenue over each of the past eight quarters.FactSet Research is expected to give its next earnings report for FQ2 2014 on Wednesday, December 18th. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for FDS to report $1.23 EPS and $224.05M revenue while the current Estimize consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.24 EPS and $224.42M revenue. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we're seeing a smaller differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers.Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has increased from $1.22 to $1.23 while over the same period the revenue expectation has declined from $224.58M to $224.05M. The Estimize EPS consensus for revenue has recently fallen slightly from $224.66M to $224.42M. Over the previous six quarters, FDS has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS four times and has beaten the consensus for revenue once. Over the three quarters for which there is sufficient data FDS has never beaten the Estimize consensus on EPS but has exceeded the Estimize consensus for revenue once.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $1.24 to $1.25 EPS and $223.7M to $225.00M in revenues. For the upcoming quarter we are seeing a narrower than normal distribution of estimates. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution signaling the potential for less volatility post earnings, or wider vice versa.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is elebovic who projects a $1.24 EPS and $225.00M in revenue. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. elebovic who is ranked 75th overall among over 3,300 contributing analysts is making a call in-line with the community expectation for EPS but he expects more revenue from the data and analytics company.This quarter the Estimize community is expecting a slightly better than Wall Street report on the top and bottom lines for FactSet Research.Disclosure: None."
632111,25372,2012-06-01T16:08:20-04:00,,"I have owned shares of FactSet (NYSE:FDS) for a while now, and I have been rewarded handsomely. The stock's consistently high returns on equity, high profit margins, and cash-rich, low-debt balance sheet are evidence of this company's excellent operating history. That healthy operation easily transfers into shareholder wealth because 85% of the Operating Cash Flow is converted into Free Cash Flow, which can be used for growth, dividends or buybacks.So why have I sold my stock? Simply put, the current valuation does not give FactSet a tempting risk/reward ratio.(Source: Finviz.com)The stock is trading near all-time highs. However, the earnings growth rate does not support the current P/E ratio. The pre-tax income growth year-over-year for the quarter ended February 29, 2012, was 16.1%. (I am using pre-tax income growth for last quarter because net income was lowered substantially by the expiration of the research and development tax credit. This credit was extended on May 17, so this was a temporary effect to net income.)This 16.1% growth rate compares with a P/E of 26.8, giving a trailing PEG of 1.66. I typically like to invest in companies with a PEG less than 1, however FactSet commands a premium because of its earnings stability.To get a sense of that premium, let's look at the 10-year valuation history:(Data Source: MSN Money)The current trailing PEG of 1.66 is higher than the 10-year average trailing PEG of 1.25. So even if FactSet continues its 16.1% growth rate, it would be overvalued compared with its historical valuation. However, I do not think the current growth rate will continue;  82% of FactSet's clients are investment managers, like hedge funds, and the remaining 18% are sell-side clients, who primarily rely on FactSet's systems for merger and acquisition work.The stock is still coasting on better-than-expected performance for the period ended February 29, 2012. This growth was largely caused by an unsually high number of new hedge funds in 2011 - 1113 new funds, near the all-time high of 1197 new funds back in 2007.Equity funds were the most popular type of new hedge fund. But global equity markets have just had their worst month since the European credit crisis began in September, and as FactSet has stated in its 10-K, ""extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers."" I think markets are going to continue to get worse before they get better, so FactSet's buy-side client growth should decrease.FactSet's client growth on the buy side was partially offset by shrinking numbers of sell-side clients. As FactSet explains, ""lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in mergers and acquisitions funded by debt."" I believe merger and acquisition activity will decrease as the European credit crisis continues to erode confidence in the global banking system.FactSet's Director of Global Sales Michael Frankenfield commented on the last conference call, ""when the sell side is hot, it's really hot, and when it's not, it's horrendous."" I think it's about to get horrendous.FactSet's stock performance has historically been loosely correlated to the Financial Services Industry:(Source: Google Finance)FDS tends to increase when the iShares Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYF) is increasing and tends to decrease when the ETF is decreasing. However, the two recently decoupled following the earnings release on March 13. I expect the market will restore the correlation in the coming weeks, ahead of FactSet's earnings announcement on June 12.I can't be too sure of the results that will be announced on June 12. The great performance of U.S. stocks during the first quarter may have lured more equity funds and investors into the market, however this will be offset by the temporary effects of the tax credit expiration, and a continuing bad environment for sell-side clients. Whether or not FactSet reports better than expected numbers, I do not expect a pop similar to the one following the March 13 announcement, because the market bias is far more negative now.I don't expect the fallout from the European Credit Crunch to have long-term impacts on the success of the business. FactSet's business model is still strong and I expect the number of clients to increase in the long-term as FactSet continues to gain market share from its competitors, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI). But, in the short term, I expect FactSet's stock price to trend lower as the market discounts financial services companies as a whole.In the meantime, why not begin to accumulate other financial service companies that have already been discounted? For example, I like Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) at current prices. It is trading at a trailing PEG of .60, and it's part of a virtual duopoly on energy and agricultural commodity trading, so it has a large competitive moat. In addition, it recently posted record trading in its Brent energy contracts, and the CEO is working on a deal to purchase the highly-profitable London Metals Exchange (1, 2), so there are signs that its high growth rate will continue.Occasionally, overvaluations can cause even great companies like FactSet to become a sell. During times like these, when so many stocks are undervalued, it is better to own stocks that are priced low enough to have a large margin of safety. I think it is time to get out of FactSet shares and wait for a pullback to buy them back for cheap.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ICE over the next 72 hours."

1927371,48501,2014-01-03T13:42:45-05:00,,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (NYSE:FDS) provides integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. The company reported fiscal first quarter earnings which were in-line with estimates but missed on revenues by less than a million. The revenues model is subscription based with enterprises paying roughly $20k-$25k per user annually.One thousand new users would equate to about 2.6% revenues growth at the current revenues level. So, being able to add one thousand to two thousand new users annually in the global financial industry should not be too difficult of a task. The switching costs, time and training, can be prohibitively high for financial institutions. Consequently, of both of the aforementioned, I can see continued revenues growth over the next three years.Financial institutions can offset the cost of a subscription with an investment in FactSet. Based on the current dividend, an investment of just under $2M would yield enough to cover the $25k subscription fee, excluding taxes. Investing in FactSet can reduce operating expenditure.I think of an investment in FactSet in two parts. What is my outlook for financial markets (because of the buy-side client base), and how much am I paying for shares? So, the next three years in the financial industry should generally be rosy on inexpensive money and global economic momentum. When I think about the valuation, I say 24.4 times earnings isn't pricey, but I would like to get shares closer to 22-22.5 times earnings, about $100 per share.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryFactSet Research Systems Inc. is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. FactSet combines content regarding companies and securities from major markets all over the globe into a single online platform of information and analytics. By consolidating content from hundreds of databases with powerful analytics, FactSet supports the investment process from initial research to published results for buy and sell-side professionals. The company's revenues are derived from subscriptions to services, content and financial applications. Approximately 81.6% of FactSet's revenues are derived from investment management clients and the remainder is from investment banking firms who perform M&A advisory work and equity research.FactSet has a history of net revenue growth. The company's net revenue has grown for 33 consecutive years with 17 consecutive years of earnings growth. Increasing net revenues is partly attributable to international expansion.Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters Inc., and Standard & Poor's Capital IQ are FactSet's main competitors. Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters comprise about 61% of the $25 billion global market data and analysis space. There are numerous other competitors, such as Morningstar Inc., MSCI Inc., and Interactive Data Corporation. I estimate that FactSet has just over a 3% market share.FactSet competes at the high end of the market with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters also offers middle market solutions. Bloomberg offers high-end solutions. Competition is fierce at the high end of the market, but FactSet offers a competitive solution, based on my experience.The total number of clients increased 15 consecutive quarters as reported total clients stood at 2,500 at the end of fiscal 2013. The client count increased by 108 in fiscal 2013 and 155 in fiscal 2012. Total users increased 2.9% in fiscal 2013, which means that net revenues growth was also attributable to higher revenues per user.Cash generated is being returned to shareholders. FactSet's shareholder capital return program was active in fiscal 2013; the company returned 154.5% of free cash flow to investors. I expect scaled back capital distributions during fiscal 2014, but fiscal 2015 capital distributions could be significantly larger. Additionally, the capital expenditure requirements appear to be structurally relatively small, so investors should be able to expect relatively large capital distributions in future periods.During the fiscal first quarter, FactSet announced a $300M expansion to the existing share repurchase program and generated $222M of revenues, which was the lower end of management's guidance. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.22 was at the midpoint of the guidance range; this assumes the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit is re-enacted. Mid-single digit growth for a company in a mature industry is in-line with the long-term sustainable growth rate that I estimate.Management is forecasting second quarter results in-line with recent growth, which is unsurprising considering the subscriptions based business model. Fiscal second-quarter revenues are forecasted to increase just over 5% at the low end. The U.S. Federal R&D tax credit probably will remain expired during FQ2; thus, the forecast is for GAAP diluted EPS between $1.20-$1.23.RisksValuationThe enterprise is trading at 24.4 times trailing earnings while the S&P 500 trades at 17.9 times trailing earnings. I view FactSet as a company that should trade at a 20%-25% premium to the market because of the business model. On a forward PE basis, FactSet is moderately overvalued at about 23 times forward earnings. These shares are going to be difficult to buy right now, but I don't want to pay more than $105 for shares, and I would rather pay $100 per share or about 22 to 22.5 times earnings.Price/book value and price/sales are relatively high, but price/book is skewed by share repurchases. At the same time, the market is paying a substantial premium for sales -- 5.6 times. The premium is partly a growth premium and partly a premium for the stability of this subscription model. The profitability also accounts for a portion of the price/sales premium. The premium is attributable to excellent business fundamentals.I'm bullish on the three year outlook. I think we'll still be in a low interest rate environment. Generally, asset prices will remain inflated, which should result in incremental revenues growth for FactSet on increased buy-side expenditure. Longer term, I don't foresee us not needing the global data providers as data quality remains a cornerstone of the investment industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1970521,52262,2014-01-28T14:29:28-05:00,,"Database and research services company FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS) is well positioned in an industry that has significant barriers to entry and which serves the slowly rebounding financial services business. Yet despite the strong underlying position of the firm, there are still some headwinds for the firm and investors.First, the overall financial services industry is growing again, but the industry's headcount is still very close to stagnant. For firms like FDS that rely on selling seat licenses to products based on the number of people using a given product, the lack of robust headcount growth is a problem. While FactSet's client count and new user trends will likely continue their gradual upward trajectory for the foreseeable future, this is largely driven by the firm picking up new market share and the proliferation in buy side firms. Sell side conditions are far less bright though, and many financial services firms are adding people only slowly. FDS' broad platform of proprietary products are a partially mitigating factor (and help explain the firm's outstanding 92% client retention rate), but nonetheless, I would be a lot more optimistic about the company if it had robust financial industry growth as a tailwind.Second, for a firm with around 8-10% revenue and EPS growth (~8.6% five year revenue growth, and ~9.7% net income growth), FDS is not particularly cheap. The firm trades at around $107 a share with CY 2014 expected earnings of about $4.99. While not absurdly expensive, this is hardly cheap enough to warrant a definite investment… unless you believe that firm growth will pick up as the economy gains steam. And that's the key question for FactSet shareholders; how much will the improving economy help the firm?FactSet's business centers around providing global economic and financial data through databases that the firm sells to investment professionals, academic economists, and certain government agencies. In fact though, FDS sells not only its own products, but it also acts as a distributor of content for more than 170 different data providers. While distributing content for others is certainly a value additive activity, I see FDS' own data (which they have recently invested heavily in creating and expanding), as a key proprietary advantage for the firm. All of FactSet's data and that which they distribute is available on a single platform which can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously and remotely via the internet.FactSet's closest competitors are companies like Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), Bloomberg, and McGraw-Hill Financial (MHFI). Despite this though, each of these firms is unique and thus many clients subscribe to multiple companies' databases. In this sense then FDS has significant barriers to competition; it would be very difficult for another vendor to come along and replicate FDS' data and provide the same services to FDS' clients. The often long-term data contracts that FDS has in place with companies, agencies, and universities would make this even more difficult. The switching costs for these institutions is very high, and as a result, FactSet's revenue streams are largely protected from serious risk of competition. As of 3Q2103, FDS had 2,500 clients representing roughly 51,000 users vs. roughly 2,400 clients and 49,500 users in the year-ago period.While FactSet does face some risk of a global economic contraction in the financial services industry, (for example perhaps driven by a Chinese financial crisis radiating outward to the rest of the emerging markets and thus hitting money center bank and global investment bank profitability hard), I think this risk is fairly minimal. In such a situation, banking capex budgets (which fund FDS research contracts) would likely be cut and over the long term FDS would lose clients. Similarly, in the event that global economic uncertainty continues to constrain headcount expansion at financial firms, FDS may see lower revenue growth than it has in the past.Absent these risks though, the firm should do well. The global economic recovery seems to be picking up steam (recent EM events not withstanding), and I believe FDS could see revenue growth of 5-6% in FY 2014 based on financial services profit growth of 8-10%. This is slightly slower than FDS ~6.5% sales expansion in FY 2013, but still a fairly reasonable expansion rate. FDS' client based is 80% buy side firms, and 20% sell side firms, with a strong concentration in US in particular. One big opportunity for FactSet then is to aggressively expand internationally over the next few years.In the meantime though, FDS will be heavily dependent on a rebounding US financial sector. The sharp rise in equities last year undoubtedly should help the firm going forward as many buy side firms are flush with profits and carrying much higher AUM levels. As buy side firms look to continue their strong returns and search for any advantage they can find, many may turn to FactSet and their data products. In particular the recent development of new products in the firm's portfolio have hurt margins a bit, driving them down 300 bps. This investment should payoff though as the expansion cycle for financial firms starts, and universities and government agencies find their budgets expanding with the improving economy.While FactSet appears poised to take advantage of an upturn in the economy, and it has a long-term opportunity to expand internationally, the firm is still fairly expensive at today's levels. Any hiccup in the prospects for economic expansion or frugality on the part of financial firm execs could hammer the stock in the short run. Given this, while as a long-term investor, I might start a long position at today's levels, I would leave some powder in reserve to add to the position in the event of a significant pullback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in FDS over the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:FDS) reports preliminary financial results for the year ended 2012-08-31.FactSet Research Systems Inc. recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which CapitalCube provides a unique peer-based analysis of the company. Our analysis is based on the company's performance over the last twelve months (unless stated otherwise).FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: News Corp. Cl B (NASDAQ:NWS), Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), McGraw-Hill Cos.(MHP), IHS Inc. Cl A (IHS), MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI) and Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversFactSet Research Systems Inc. currently trades at a higher Price/Book ratio (8.3) than its peer median (6.1). FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s operating performance is higher than the median of its chosen peers (ROE of 35.4% compared to the peer median ROE of 11.8%). However, the market does not seem to expect higher growth relative to peers (PE of 24.9 compared to peer median of 28.8), but simply for the company to maintain its relatively high rates of return.The company has a successful operating strategy with above median net profit margins of 23.4% (vs. peer median of 13.3%) and relatively high asset turns of 1.2x (vs. peer median of 0.6x). This suggests that the company has a dominant operating model relative to its peers. FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s net margin is similar to last year's high of 23.5%, which compares to a low of 21.7% in 2008.Economic MoatThe company enjoys both better than peer median annual revenue growth of 10.9% and better than peer median earnings growth performance 10.4%. FactSet Research Systems Inc. currently converts every 1% of change in annual revenue into 1.0% of change in annual reported earnings. We view this company as a leader among its peers.FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s return on assets is above its peer median both in the current period (27.9% vs. peer median 5.8%) and also over the past five years (24.6% vs. peer median 7.2%). This performance suggests that the company's relatively high operating returns are sustainable.The company's gross margin of 70.0% is around peer median suggesting that FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. However, FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s pre-tax margin is more than the peer median (34.1% compared to 21.5%) suggesting relatively tight control on operating costs.Growth & Investment StrategyFactSet Research Systems Inc.'s revenues have grown at about the same rate as its peers (9.0% vs. 7.9% respectively for the past three years). Similarly, the stock price implies median long-term growth as its PE ratio is around the peer median of 24.9. The historical performance and long-term growth expectations for the company are largely in sync.FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 3.3% over the past three years is around the same as its peer median of 3.3%. This investment has generated a better than peer median return on capital of 33.0% averaged over the same three years. The greater than peer median rate of return suggest that the company may be under investing in growth.Earnings QualityFactSet Research Systems Inc. has reported relatively strong net income margin for the last twelve months (23.4% vs. peer median of 13.3%). This margin performance combined with relatively low accruals (5.4% vs. peer median of 9.5%) suggests possible aggressive accounting and an overstatement of its reported net income.FactSet Research Systems Inc.'s accruals over the last twelve months are positive, suggesting a buildup of reserves. But this level of accruals is less than the peer median -- which suggests that while the company is building reserves, it is doing so in a relatively modest manner compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany Profile FactSet Research Systems, Inc. is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community.

1805112,46261,2013-11-05T08:31:41-05:00,,"Despite increasing amounts of data available, which itself helps to fuel the big data megatrend, and the abundance of free information - partly including too much data - that often lacks relevance, clarity and quick, professional analysis with actionable conclusion, businesses, institutions and individuals are willing to pay ever more to get access to premium professional information that helps them cut the clutter or to which others will not have access or delayed access.When I research macroeconomic and industry trends as well as individual companies, I often gather information from various research resources, such as FactSet, Gartner (NYSE:IT), IDC, IHS, Bloomberg, Reuters (NYSE:TRI), Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) and SeekingAlpha. As the price and importance of relevant information keeps growing, all these companies will enjoy increasing subscriptions numbers, sales and earnings. The financial data and research industry has been getting ever more complex through many fast-changing trends, such as the rapid shift to electronic trading, cross-border trading, complex financial products innovations, unprecedented monetary policy, unpredictable black swan events and many other changes and challenges that make risk and portfolio management more complicated. The sheer number of data sources has been growing exponentially, making the simple goal of staying on top of the market information loop an enormous challenge if not handled properly.One of the largest publicly traded companies providing integrated data and analytics services to the financial industry is FactSet Research Systems, Inc. (NYSE:FDS). The company has increased its revenues for 33 consecutive years and raised dividend by more than 10% every single year for 10 straight years now. This is some of the most consistent dividend growth performance of all stocks available. FactSet has been gaining market share in the past few quarters despite this tough market environment, as new client acquisition conversion rates have risen. FactSet has extremely high retention rates in the 90s (92% in terms of the number of clients and 95% in terms of revenue) as well as predominantly subscription-based pricing model. Moreover, the company's business model is centered on strong cross-selling abilities. Hence, as the time passes by, these new seats will drive additional revenue.Despite the tough market environment, the company has been able to log organic growth from new seats (full terminal service subscriptions) from new clients, additional seats from existing customers, as well as the overall sales growth driven by other add-on services. This is an excellent sign of competitive strength. The company added an all-time record 60 new clients in the past quarter. Therefore, savvy investors should take advantage of any short-term weakness to finally be able to purchase FactSet at a reasonable price because in the long run, the company will perform well both on the back of its ability to gain market share, as well as the underlying growth of the industry.Although FactSet seems fully priced based on the current P/E and other valuation metrics, it is for a good reason and FactSet is definitely not overpriced in terms of a comparison with its peers if investors consider FactSet's pure focus on the financial data and analytics industry and the resulting higher margins. Moreover, most of the competitors are larger and more diversified but less focused on the core business of financial data and analytics delivered through a single platform, tools and apps. This is one of the reasons why FactSet is better positioned for future growth than its competitors. Its strong financial position will enable it to acquire further information services to build the largest proprietary database of services and continue ramping up its competitive advantage.More importantly, the company's own intrinsic value shows that it is still a compelling investment over the long run. The company's focus on delivering value to shareholders through steady dividend growth on a low payout ratio and zero debt certainly adds to FactSet's appeal, although, I have to admit the current dividend yield is still below-average and it is not really that much of a challenge to grow the dividend at 10-plus% annual rates with such a high buffer created by a low payout ratio and a low dividend yield. FactSet currently also has a strong share-buyback program and if regular quarterly dividends paid and shares repurchased over the past 12 months are combined, the company has returned $388M to shareholders, which represents 8% of the market cap.Due to the long-term growth prospects as well as a recurring revenue model, very high retention rates and a history of delivering value to shareholders, FactSet is an excellent investment for the very long term that has much more room to run. Due to the stock currently trading 4% above its intrinsic value, which implies a 9% total annual return in the long run, I recommend that investors buy into this stock gradually by means of a regular dollar-cost-averaging program and increase their purchases if the stock pulls back below its fair value.Company backgroundFactSet is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. The company's strategy is to provide integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community byconsolidating data content with powerful analytics on a single platform, while aiming to make its products fully customizable for a broader range of user types. The company's competitive edge over its larger competitors is the focus that it devotes to the area of financial data and analytics and the broadest set of functionalities and data sources integrated that creates substantial barriers of entry and enables FactSet to introduce premium-priced products even in the current competitive environment. Hence, continuous product innovation to stay ahead of the competitors in terms of relevance, proprietary datasets, speed and customizability is paramount.Current financial situationFor the fiscal fourth quarter that ended August 31, 2013, FactSet reported adjusted EPS of $1.20, a rise of 11% compared to the same period last year, delivering double-digit EPS growth for 13th consecutive quarter. The company also had its best quarter in terms of both client and user additions since 2011. The organic annual subscription value (a key metric that the company uses to generate recurring sales as well as anticipate future revenue) grew less in percentage terms, by 6% YoY. However, this is due to the naturally lower initial value of new customers, and lower ASV is actually a positive development -- (if coupled with growing share of new subscribers as is the case -- because it means there is large potential to cross-sell services to these new users and grow their ASV to the traditional levels of more seasoned users. In other words, the ASV doesn't tell us anything about the development of the average revenue per user in time for the users in the same lifecycle stage. Unfortunately, the company claims not to have such numbers. This is one of the key metrics to watch for any subscription-based business, such as telecoms, online subscription services or online shopping sites.FactSet ended the fiscal year with revenues of $888M. Free cash flow over the 12 months reached $250M and was not only 20% higher YoY, but it was also 27% higher than net income for this year, which continues to demonstrate the high quality of the company's earnings. Share of U.S. sales reached 68%. Buy-side clients accounted for 81.6% of ASV and the remaining 18.4% was derived from sell-side clients, M&A advisory and equity research businesses. The organic sales growth this year was more in the company's traditional business of terminals in the buy-side and sell-side segments. Traditionally, the sell-side business isn't anywhere near the revenue per seat than the buy-side primarily because the Analytics products are almost 100% purchased on the buy-side. Hence, it is important for FactSet to maintain strong focus on the buy-side segment. Margins remained very high at 64.3% gross margin, 31.4% operating margin and 23.2% net profit margin.Near-term future industry outlook still muted, offering opportunity to buyThe company's outlook for the next quarter ending November 30, 2013, is revenues in the range between $222M and $225M. Operating margins are expected to range between 33% and 34%, which include a 30 basis-points reduction from the Revere Data acquisition. GAAP-diluted EPS should range between $1.21 and $1.24. The midpoint of the range represents 10% growth over last year's same quarter earnings.The strong, long-term growth outlook is temporarily overshadowed by increasing short-term industry headwinds. Although the hiring that happened on the sell-side this quarter was higher than FactSet expected, it certainly nothing exciting versus prior years. There are also signs of buy-side headcount hiring, but again, ""very muted"". Overall, the industry of financial data and analytics is having challenging times with generally tepid subscriber growth and falling margins despite moderately rising average revenue per subscriber. FactSet is no exception. Weak employment numbers in the financial sector and threats from increasingly strong competitors, such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, Standard & Poor's including Capital IQ, MSCI, Dealogic, Interactive Data Corporation, Dow Jones & Company and Morningstar, which has been increasingly venturing outside of serving just retail investors toward catering to professional institutions, add to FactSet's anxiety over its future.Despite competition, long-term growth prospects are strongFactSet has been growing primarily organically over the years, helped by strategic acquisitions. The company will remain focused on its core business and clients in the future. However, there is still room for vertical integration within this area, such as owning some of the data streams that the company integrates into its platform instead of losing part of the profits through licensing or other revenue sharing deals with outside data owners. Hence, investors can get ready for smart, targeted acquisitions of some more content providers that currently provide data streams to the FactSet platform, supported by highly-qualified in-house staff of consultants, product, sales and customer service people who offer the best-of-breed customer experience. In terms of market segments, FactSet plans to expand especially its fixed-income tools and services. The recent acquisition of Revere Data was in line with this goal.Moreover, FactSet will continue to focus on sustaining the positive momentum of being able to gain market share as in the past few quarters. Continued focus on the lucrative buy-side segment with significantly higher average revenue per user is paramount. The company's more than 80% share of the buy-side of revenues is a high and promising number. Another area through which FactSet will keep growing in the future is cutting costs of managing the big data by gradually migrating its databases and servers to smaller, faster and more cost-effective machines and systems that will save substantial amount of costs in the upcoming years, providing room for higher margins or more investments or lower prices to capture further market share.FactSet also has ample room for geographic expansion, larger than most of its competitors. The company currently has offices in 26 countries and plans to expand into additional fast-growing, emerging markets. The company's pristine balance sheet and strong cash flow generation abilities position it well for this expansion.FactSet continues to gain market share despite industry headwinds thanks to innovation and broadening of its servicesNevertheless, FactSet continues to expand its portfolio of services, mainly in the direction of risk management services with an incorporation of data from Fitch as well as with the September 2013 acquisition of the Revere Data, LLC and the September announcement that Ipreo will offer FactSet workstation and excel tools as part of its suite of corporate services.Continuous expansion of proprietary data sources and services is keyTo illustrate the tough competitive environment and its dynamics, when Standard & Poor's Capital IQ acquired TheMarkets.com and made it exclusive to Capital IQ, FactSet lost revenues due to losing TheMarkets.com's earnings estimates feed. Hence, building proprietary sources of data is absolutely essential in maintaining competitiveness. I would not be surprised if SeekingAlpha.com was approached by FactSet or some other integrated financial data services platforms with a takeover offer to lock in this source of high-quality investment analysis to make it proprietary to their clients. Alternatively SeekingAlpha.com could ask a premium price for licensing part of its content to FactSet only.ValuationIn case of vast majority of the companies, I use only five years of EPS growth followed by zero terminal EPS growth rate. However, in the rare case of FactSet, I am willing to increase the timeframe of the growth period to ten years due to the resilience of the company's past sales and high margins as well as the strong business moat and prevalent business model based on monthly or annual subscriptions. I am also using a lower-than-usual 9% discount rate due to the recurring nature of a major part of revenues, high 92% retention rate and stable dividend growth. I expect a 10% average sales and EPS growth rate - slower than in the past - and a 23% net profit margin in line with historical and current values. Using these assumptions and expectations, the company's fair value is roughly $103.30 per share, just a few percentage points below the current stock price.RisksThe downside risk is substantial, given the priced-in relatively high sales growth and extraordinarily high margins. The stock could easily trade 30% lower from here if the growth thesis stalls or if margins start to fall as the competition intensifies. A general economic downturn poses a similar risk. However, even during the 2008/2009 crisis the stock only lost roughly 50% of its value from peak to trough, but quickly recovered. In the long run, FactSet has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.ConclusionFactSet is an excellent dividend growth stock. Although it is fully priced, there are good reasons for the price, and the stock should be gradually added to a portfolio over multiple smaller purchases spread in time for strong, very long-term total returns of roughly 9% per year expected to come from a combination of rock-steady, growing dividends and stock repurchases. Any stock pullback caused by a broad market weakness should be viewed as an excellent buying opportunity. FactSet is actually one of the few stocks that I would be willing to buy and forget for a decade.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

482851,24492,2012-04-08T02:19:37-04:00,,"FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) is a rapidly growing dividend star. The money management industry is intensely fierce as each competitor wants an edge on other hedge funds and buy side shops. I own FactSet stock due to the high quality of research provided to clients. FactSet sells financial data to hedge funds, buy side entities, high net worth clients and endowments. The data is considered vital to the success of well to do investment entities. Research is the key to the success or failure of hedge funds. In this article I'll focus upon FactSet's current 1.1% dividend yield and why the yield on cost should increase for years to come.FactSet Research Systems' 15 Year Dividend and Stock PerformanceOverviewFactSet Research Systems was established in 1978 to provide financial research and data to Wall Street, when reports were delivered by hand and computers and networks were not mainstream. Over the past 33 years since its founding, FactSet has grown its product and service offerings significantly, kept pace with technological innovation, gone public with shares listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, expanded overseas, won multiple awards and grown annual revenue to over $726 million in 2011.FactSet earns its revenue from customer subscriptions for its data and tools. In 2011, FactSet received 68.5% of its revenue from the U.S., 24.6% from Europe and 6.9% from Asia and in all from 24 worldwide offices. Over the years, FactSet has seen its annual subscription value (NASDAQ:ASV) increase from $235 million in 2003 to $803 million in 2012 at a compounded annual growth rate of 13%. That said, global economic weakness, a prolonged bear market, consolidation or failures in the investment banking sector and its own ability to keep pace with technological innovation and competition could impact FactSet's business and revenues.Type of InformationToday, FactSet provides real time and near real time financial information and analytical tools to global investment managers, investment bankers, professional investors, financial media, corporations, academia and economics, accounting and finance related entities across the world. FactSet is used for equity analysis, quantitative models, risk analysis, portfolio analysis, fixed income analysis, charting and presentations, deal analytics, idea screening, people intelligence, accountability and corporate governance.FactSet's information includes economic and financial data on countries, industries and tens of thousands of companies across the globe with information such as financials (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow), news summaries, earnings releases, transcripts of investor presentations, deal data (mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs), shareholder data (shares outstanding, ownership, insider transactions, block purchases, analysts' earnings estimates), industry and competition data, comparable fundamentals (valuation and performance ratios, comparable deals, debt-to-equity benchmarks) and almost every other piece of relevant data.Proprietary DataFactSet serves up its mother lode of data using its proprietary technology based platform which allows users to either log in and access data or have data sent to them in real-time. FactSet makes data easier to use with a host of analytical tools such as Single Name Security Exposures so a portfolio manager can gauge exposure to a single stock or security across all portfolios, Ownership 2.0 for data on stock ownership, FUEL Sidebar for real time data integration into Excel models, Company Reports that translates company reports into web ready HTML formats for quick publishing, Country Synopsis for country specific financial data, Microsoft Office Integration and a few others.FactSet attempts to differentiate its services by focusing on technology innovation such as supporting wireless devices, adding new features and tools, attention to detail and data accuracy, expanding its reach into promising new global economies and 24/7 customer support. On the financial front, FactSet strives to manage its balance sheet well and carries no debt.FactSet's main competitors include international financial data providers such as Bloomberg, BondEdge, CapitalIQ, Dealogic, Polypaths, Thompson Reuters, Wilshire Associates and the Yield Book.FinancialsFactSet's financial year starts on September 1. On March 13, 2012, FactSet announced results for its second quarter ended February 29, 2012. It reported quarterly revenues of $199.4 million, an increase of 12.2% relative to 2011's $177.6 million. Operating income rose 15.5% year-over-year to $67.1 million and net income was up 3.3% to $46.7 million. Diluted earnings per share grew 7.4% to $1.02. Revenue growth came from 53 net new clients and 400 net new users for a total user base of 47,300 across 2,324 clients. Client retention is an important forward indicator for revenue and earnings consistency and at quarter end, FactSet's client retention stood at 92%, better than the 90% retention last year.Second quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street revenue and earnings per share estimates. In addition, the company issued third quarter guidance that was also above analyst estimates.Analyst 10 Year Earnings and Dividend Growth ProjectionsThe company generated $39.1 million in cash from operations in the quarter. At quarter end, its cash balance was $185 million, investments stood at $15.2 million and total assets were $663.8 million. FactSet carried no debt, had $119.8 million in total liabilities and $544 million in stockholders' equity.The company's ASV rose to $803 million with 81% of its subscription revenue from buy side clients primarily engaged in asset management and 19% from sell side clients (e.g., investment banks). US subscribers contributed 68.2% to ASV and the rest was international, primarily Europe and Asia.DividendsFor the quarter, FactSet earned $1.02 per share (GAAP diluted earnings) of which it paid 27 cents as dividends per share. FactSet has a 27% payout ratio which allows it to retain earnings for research and development, marketing, customer retention and market expansion into new geographies, and as such strikes a balance between satisfying shareholders with cash distributions while also focusing on growth initiatives which get parlayed into higher dividend distributions.Management continues to increase the dividend on an annual basis. The yield on cost will increase as the stock should continue to grow, and annual dividends should continue to grow.In the quarter, the company added shareholder value by buying back 507,800 shares for $45.1 million, leaving 44.8 million shares outstanding.As of April 6th, 2012, shares were trading at about $99.52 with a price to earnings ratio of 26.2x and a market capitalization of $4.45 billion (a fairly rich 8.2x book value). Shares have risen sharply since February 2009 and recently traded between $78.25 and an all time high of $112.40 over the past 52 weeks. Quarterly earnings' out performance also led to a10% increase in share price around mid March.Its low dividend yield of 1.1% is partly a reflection of the steep rise in shares over the past year.Over the years, FactSet has steadily increased dividends with only a few minor hiccups. Quarterly dividends per share have risen from 3 cents in 2000 to 23 cents in 2010 and up 17.3% to 27 cents over the past four quarters for an annual dividend of $1.08 per share.FactSet has a steady subscription based revenue model and has successfully grown revenue over the years. It has also exercised solid financial discipline with zero debt and a consistent history of dividend payments. This discipline has paid off handsomely for investors who have received consistent dividends and seen shares rise four fold from about $25 in January 2002 to almost $100 in April 2012.From a news and company publicity perspective, FactSet maintains a low profile and typically only announces dividend and earnings regularly but abstains from other public relations' noise. In summary, FactSet has conducted its financial affairs and shareholder obligations rather well and shareholders in turn have rewarded the company with steady stock growth.CompetitionAccurate and actionable research is the cornerstone to any investment. FactSet has various competitors. The overall financial competition is focused more at the sell side shops and less at the buy side shops. Here are four publicly retail, sell side, and buy side competitors:1. McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. (MHP)McGraw Hill has four key segments: Standard & Poors (S&P) Ratings, S&P Capital IQ/S&P Indices, Commodities & Commercial, and McGraw Hill Education. The company offers financial, commodities, independent benchmark data, and analytical tools to its customer base.2. Morningstar Inc. (MORN)Morningstar offers independent investment research to investors on a global basis. The company has two core segments: Investment Information and Investment Management. The Investment Information segment is targeted towards sell side, retail, financial advisors and individual clients. Investment Management offers subscription products, management analytical tools, and the Advisor Workstation.3. Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI)Thomson Reuters offers investors to connect, access content, and trade in a secure environment through Thomson Reuters Eikon desktop, Thomson Reuters Elektron network. Thomson Reuters Elektron is a trading and data infrastructure that offers global market access with modern trading programs. Clientele can trade in foreign exchange markets, fixed income and derivatives markets, and equities.4. MSCI Inc. (MSCI)MSCI offers products to address risk management, performance, and corporate governance products on a global scale. Tools include investment decision support tools, performance analytics, and credit analytics. The company has approximately 5,800 customers worldwide.ActionI believe dividend growth investors should buy FactSet stock. The company has a captive audience. The products sell themselves due to their proprietary nature. The clientele need the proprietary information. The dividend is likely to grow as earnings expand. 81% of clients are buy side. This is a key audience as the clients want quality products and are willing to pay for the best qualitative and quantitative information.Disclosure: I am long FDS."

The stock was on my Buy List for a few years but I decided to ditch it after 2009.I often tell investors not to worry about stocks you used to own  after you sell it. I'm going to break that rule for a moment because I'd  love to add it back to the Buy List.Unfortunately, FDS had a very good 2010 so it was a bad move on my  part. But I truly thought the shares were too expensive and I've been  waiting for a pullback ever since.Today, the company reported earnings and the results matched what the  company told us to expect. The guidance for the current quarter,  however, did not impress Wall Street.Uh oh! You can't say 93 to 95 cents per share when the Street expects 95 cents.This is a great example of how investing works. If you give people a  reason to sell, even if it's not a great reason, they'll take it — and  that's what's happening to FDS today.FactSet is a great company and I'm keeping a close eye on it.

242579,23048,2010-12-19T06:38:30-05:00,,"By David GibbsFactSet Research Systems Inc. (NYSE:FDS) is a provider of global financial and economic information including fundamental data on tens of thousands of companies worldwide. FactSet supports the investment process from initial research to published results for buy- and sell-side professionals including portfolio managers, research analysts, risk managers, investment bankers and fixed income professionals.The company sports a $4.3 billion market cap, a 0.99% dividend and has beaten estimates in ten of the past twelve quarters.Earnings: 1Q profit of $41.6 million ($0.88/share) vs. 1Q09 profit of $36.1 million ($0.74/share). Profit during the most recent Q was buoyed by $0.03/share in income tax benefits.Revenue: Up 12% YoY to $173.3 million.Actual vs. Wall St. Expectations: FDS beat consensus EPS estimates by $0.04/share and came in in-line in terms of revenue.Notable Stats: FactSet issued 2Q EPS guidance of $0.85-$0.87/share vs. estimates of $0.86/share and revenue guidance of $174-$179 million vs. esitmates of $176 million. FY2011 capex guidance came in at $22-$28 million. FDS added 800 customers during 1Q, bringing its total customer base to 43,600. The company’s client count increased by 13 to 2,123. Operating income increased 10% YoY to $59.4 million vs. 1Q09 operating income of $54.0 million. Operating margins narrowed to 34.3% from 34.8% due to higher costs.Did You Hear That? Chairman and CEO Philip A. Hadley noted during the call that FDS‘ “first quarter results illustrate the strength of FactSet’s business model. FDS continues to be able to provide superior workflow solutions to clients and grow both our ASV and EPS.” He added that FDS “again delivered strong ASV growth, adding $11 million over the past three months while EPS was up 15%.”Technicals: Since breaking above $78.83 on September 3rd, shares of FDS have gained nearly 19%. The company’s 50-day moving average is above its 200-day line and both are upward-sloping. While volume was high during the post-earnings selloff, stabilization in shares indicates that institutional investors are in large part remaining behind the FDS story. A pullback to the 50-day line may be in the cards in the coming days, particularly if the market falls prey to general weakness. If shares can hold that marker, a bounce upward may be a good entry-point for those looking to open a position.Commentary: FactSet is one of the few competitors to the ubiquitous Bloomberg terminals that pepper much of Wall St. in addition to offices around the world. 82% of the company’s revenue is derived from buy-side clients, with the remainder coming from sell-side firms, generally those performing M&A advisory or equity research. Shares fell as much as 4% following last week’s report, but given the steep rise that the stock has enjoyed over the past few months, such a dip should not be interpreted as a cause for great concern.Analysts at S&P maintained their Hold rating, asserting that “cancellations have slowed [and] client work forces have stabilized.” They lifted their 12-month target price by $13 to $101.In the end, FactSet does not need to unseat Bloomberg to continue to enjoy great success. Rather, the company merely needs Wall St. revenue streams to continue to expand. Those of you who would like to play the health of the financial sector without having to attempt to value a zombie bank may find FDS to be an interesting derivative play on the space.[Click to enlarge]Disclosure: No holdings in FDS."

FDS recently declared financial results for FY 2010 modestly beating analyst expectations, capitalizing on improved spending on investment tools.Wall Street is bullish on FDS.  The consensus price target for FDS has risen during the last 90 days from $76 to $91. However, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum cut the stock from Buy to Hold last week citing the 25% run up in stock price over the last 3 months.  He recommends buying the stock in low $70s. In this article, I will attempt to estimate the fair value of FactSet Research Systems stock and determine whether going against the majority of Wall Street makes sense.Company Financials and Valuation Discounted Cash Flow ValuationDCF valuation of FDS was performed by employing a two-stage model with a high growth period of 10 years.  The major inputs and the valuation results are presented below.  The growth rate used as part of this analysis was based on a combination of fundamental analysis, company guidance and average analyst estimates. Relative ValuationThe estimated fair value using various relative valuation methods is presented below.  It should be noted that the data from the last 4 financial years was taken in calculating the estimates shown in the table. Adjustments were made to account for outliers present in the dataset. Fair ValueBased on the analysis results shown above, the fair value of FDS is $75 a share. As of September 27, 2010, the stock was trading at $80.46 and was overvalued by approximately 7%. Therefore, my analysis results are consistent with the analyst from Stifel Nicolaus. In my opinion, this stock is a short candidate if you believe that a minor correction in S&P 500 is warranted (which I do).  Based on the most recent data, FDS had a short interest ratio of 6.75% (2.8 million shares).  (Kindly use this article for information purposes only.

In Factset Research's (NYSE:FDS) case, we think the firm is worth $93 per share, slightly lower than where it is currently trading. We wouldn't be surprised to see the shares trade down to those levels.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:(Click to enlarge)If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Factset Research posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment, unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. We use Moody's (NYSE:MCO), McGraw-Hill (MHP), Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), and Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Factset Research (Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations(Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsFactset Research's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $74 (the low end of our fair value range), we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:(Click to enlarge)Factset Research has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 26% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 8.1% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Business Quality(Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Factset Research's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 122.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis(Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Factset Research's free cash flow margin has averaged about 27.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Factset Research, cash flow from operations decreased about 0% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 22% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Factset Research's shares are worth between $74.00 - $112.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $93 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 25.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 15.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 10.8% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 8.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 35.6%, which is above Factset Research's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Factset Research, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $93 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Factset Research. We think the firm is attractive below $74 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $112 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Factset Research's fair value at this point in time to be about $93 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Factset Research's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $123 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $93 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.(Click to enlarge)Pro Forma Financial Statements(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

(NYSE:FDS) for a long time now as it consistently appears on the primary stock screening tool that I employ in short listing companies (see my profile for further details). It is the undisputed leader in providing financial and economic information to companies worldwide and enjoys a monopolistic position.Apart from being a debt free company, FactSet has also historically maintained strong financials and routinely beats the industry metrics. Key financial information for FactSet is shown below:FactSet is an indirect way of gaining exposure to the financial sector, a sector that I usually avoid. With the recent meltdown in the financial sector, FactSet stock fell from a high of $72 in November 2007 to $31 in November 2008. Since then, the stock has recovered and currently trades at around $53 a share.Valuation:Current and Projected Earnings Relative ValuationIn performing relative valuation for FactSet Research Systems, I chose to compare the historical and current P/E ratio of FactSet with the corresponding P/E ratio of the S&P 500 index.  Comparing FactSet with its peers was a futile exercise since FactSet is leagues ahead of its nearest rivals.  The current and historical multiples for FactSet and S&P 500 index are shown in the table that follows:As shown in the Table above, historically, FDS has traded at a P/E (FDS) to P/E (S&P 500) ratio of 1.23.  It currently trades at a ratio of 1.15.  However, based on the consolidation of its client base (due to the merger/closure) and the overall sentiment in the financial sector, I believe that FactSet should trade near the low end of its historical P/E (FDS) to P/E (S&P 500) ratio.  Therefore, applying a ratio of 1.05 and assuming a modest correction in S&P 500 from these levels (P/E = 16; S&P 500 trading at 860), FactSet is projected to be trading at a multiple of 16.8.  Fair Value (based on relative valuation) = 16.8*2.76 = $46.36 Valuation Based on PEGProjected long term (5 years) growth rate = 15%.  Applying a PEG ratio of 1, the fair value of FDS = 15*$2.76 = $41.4.The CallBy combining the derived values, I am initiating coverage of FactSet Research Systems Inc with a SELL rating and a 12-month price target of $45.

I do not own any shares nor do I have any options on this stock.Let's take a closer look at this stock and why I think it's a compelling buy.What exactly does this company do?According to the Yahoo ""Profile"" on FactSet (FDS), the company""...provides financial and economic information, including fundamental financial data on various companies to the investment community worldwide. Its primary product includes Marquee, a quotes and news application for company's investment management and banking clients."" And how did they do in the latest quarter?It was the announcement of 2nd quarter 2008 earnings today, combined with the rally in equities that led to the big spike in price in FDS stock today. Earnings for the quarter ended February 29, 2008, increased 21% to $140.2 million compared to the year earlier same period. Net income increased to $29.5 million from $26.5 million last year and diluted earnings per share grew to $.59 from $.52 last year. As pointed out in this report, ""Excluding one-time costs and gains, the company earned $31.1 million or 62 cents per share compared with $26.5 million or 52 cents per share last year."" This was ahead of analysts expectations according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial who expected profit of $.60/share. The company also beat expectations on revenue which had been expected to come in at $139.6 million.Factset also raised guidance today for the upcoming quarter, guiding sales to between $145 and $149 million compared to the $121.1 million reported in the 3rd quarter of 2007. Currently, analysts polled by Thomson Financial are expecting sales of $143.5 million. This is what I have in the past referred to as a 'trifecta-plus' in an earnings report: strong growth in both revenue and earnings, beating expectations on both, associated with the raising of guidance for future results! There isn't much more an investor could want from a report than this!What about longer-term results?Since I am generally not interested in 'one-quarter wonders' on this blog, and instead am looking for stocks demonstrating persistence of quality results, I like to review the Morningstar results on each company. Reviewing the ""5-Yr Restated"" financials from Morningstar.com on this company, we can see the steady revenue growth noted by the gradual pattern of increasing purple bars...with $222 million in revenue in 2003 increasing to $476 million in 2007 and $501 million in the trailing twelve months (NYSE:TTM). Earnings show an equally consistent and impressive pattern of growth, growing from $.99/share in 2003 to $2.14/share in 2007 and $2.25/share in the TTM. The company also pays a dividend and has been steadily increasing it from $.15/share in 2003 to $.36/share in 2007 and $.42/share in the TTM. Outstanding shares have been extremely stable with 52 million shares reported in 2003 actually decreasing to 51 million in the TTM.Free cash flow has been positive and has grown, except for a slight dip in the TTM, from $72 million in 2005 to $117 million in 2007 and $110 million in the TTM.The balance sheet appears quite healthy to me with $155 million in cash, which by itself could easily pay off both the $64.9 million in current liabilities and the $28.7 million in long-term liabilities combined with plenty left over as well! Calculating the current ratio, the $242 million in total current asset, when divided by the $64.9 million in current liabilities, yields a very healthy ratio of 3.73.What about some valuation numbers?Reviewing the Yahoo ""Key Statistics"" on FactSet (FDS), we find that the company is a mid cap stock with a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. The trailing p/e is a very acceptable (for me) 23.29, with a forward p/e (fye 31-Aug-09) of 18.53). With rapid growth estimated to continue, the PEG ratio works out to an acceptable 1.15 (generally I prefer PEG's between 1.0 and 1.5).Looking at the Price/Sales ratio, we can see that the stock is reasonably priced with a Price/Sales [TTM] figure of 4.32 compared to the industry average of 4.78 per the Fidelity.com eresearch website. Profitability may be a little light compared to comparables, at least as measured by the Return on Equity [TTM] which comes in at 27.88% vs. the $31.41% ROE [TTM] of similary companies per Fidelity.Finishing up with the Yahoo numbers, there are 48.23 million shares outstanding with 42.87 million that float. Currently (as of 2/26/08) there are 4.89 million shares out short, representing 9.7 trading days of volume (the short ratio)--far in excess of my own '3 day rule' for significance. This is 11.3% of the float---and may have well resulted in a 'short squeeze' today on the back of the great earnings report and the surge in overall stock prices.As I noted, the company pays a dividend which on a 'forward basis' is $.48/share or yielding 1.00%. The last stock split, also noted above, was a 3:2 split on February 7, 2005.What does the chart look like?Looking at the 'point & figure' chart on FactSet Research (FDS) from StockCharts.com, we can see the tremendous appreciation in stock price from a low of $12 in September, 2001, to a high of $73 in October, 2007. The stock has been under some pressure recently along with all of the financial-related companies, but rebounded strongly today. The chart still looks acceptable to me without being over-extended but I would appreciate seeing the stock back at the $68 level before this amateur could feel that the technicals looked quite encouraging!  Summary: What do I think?Needless to say I really like this stock. The only thing giving me concern has been the recent weakness in all of the Financial Stocks and this stock rides along with those companies. They reported great earnings, beat expectations and raised guidance. Longer-term, they have steadily raised revenue results, earnings results, and also pay a dividend which they have been steadily raising! Outstanding shares are absolutely stable, free cash flow is positive and basically growing, and the balance sheet appears solid.Valuation-wise, the p/e is moderate, the Price/Sales is low compared to its peers, the Return on Equity is a tad weak, but the PEG is at a very acceptable level. On top of this, there are a lot of short-sellers who are feeling the Cramer 'house of pain' in this stock. Finally, with the current move higher, the stock chart is moderately hopeful for a continued appreciation in this stock price. If I were buying a stock (at least when I am following my own rules :(), this is the kind of stock I would be buying. Disclosure: no positions"

The story here is pretty simple: Wall Street is addicted to data and FDS is their dealer. The fundamentals are solid; fat margins, zero debt and nice history of churning out 20% EPS increases. I’ll warn you, FDS is expensive although it recently got a little less expense. The shares are off about 20% from their high. I think the market is concerned that many of FDS’ clients are these dearly departed hedge funds. I doubt that’s the case. FDS has a large diversified client base (2,000 clients and 33,000 users). This is a well-entrenched business. FDS 1-yr chart:"

FactSet was on last year’s Buy List and it rose 37.2%, making it our second-best performer. I decided to keep it on this year’s Buy List and it’s up 20.6% so far, again our second-best performer. Also, just because a stock is down doesn’t mean it’s cheap. I’ve often heard people say, “how much lower can it go?” The answer is, a lot. A whole lot. I remember my finance professor explaining how low zero is. A $100 stock can drop 90%, then another 90%, then another 90% and it’s still not at zero. In fact, it can drop 90% infinitely and still not be at zero. Zero is really, really, really, REALLY small, and that’s how low it can go. FDS 1-yr chart:"

58289,20364,2007-12-24T13:44:06-05:00,,"Fascinating data point Monday in the overall hand wringing about the general malaise on Wall Street.FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS), which made $475 million in last year selling software to banks and hedge funds, is headed for hard times as Wall Street retrenches, writes J.P. Morgan analyst David Lewis in a note this morning initiating coverage on the data broker. FactSet stock has already felt the pain this year, its shares up only about 1% or so, but there’s more pain ahead, says Morgan, writing that “Our channel checks of competitors, hiring firms, and recruiting departments in business schools indicate that the financial industry job environment is becoming increasingly more challenging.” FactSet sells programs backed by proprietary databases of financial and economic information, which can be used for things like comparing the alpha generated by various analyst recommendations. (Hmm, could use that here at TT Daily…) That’s a $15 billion market, of which FDS has just 2.5% share, notes Lewis.FactSet hasn’t seen much of a hit from Wall Street’s credit crunch, but the worse may be yet to come, writes Lewis. While sales grew 28% in the first fiscal quarter ended in November, says Lewis, sales could be hit by slowing real GDP growth in the current and following two quarters of between 1.5% and 2.5%. That could lead to pink slips on the M&A teams at FactSet’s customers. Observes Lewis, “Notably, layoffs on the sell-side are almost an immediate hit to revenue as passwords are canceled real-time.”Things won’t be as bad for FactSet as the 2001 to 2003 downturn in financial markets, Lewis thinks. That’s because budgets are already leaner on the Street, meaning there’s less cutting to be done, and because FactSet’s products are somewhat more mission critical, if you will, then in past years, because they’ve become more a part of the day to day “workflow” on Wall Street.Lewis has a Neutral rating on the shares, which are trading at 23 times profit per share for the year ending next August, by his estimate. He says to hold off until the global M&A scene improves.Monday, FactSet shares are down about 1% at $57.68."

He already sold the shares. If anyone is keeping track, the company has about 49 million shares outstanding. Synder's sale represents a tiny portion of the company.  It was only a week ago that the stock jumped on its earnings news. There's nothing wrong with Mr. Snyder cashing in. After all, there are a zillion reasons to sell a stock. Maybe he wants to diversify. It's not necessarily because management thinks that the shares going to tank. Snyder still owns over 4 million shares.

As more deals come through the pipe in 2006, more information has to be processed, chewed, and spit back out to the masses. That's where Factset comes in. It's service mix has already helped millions of US financial professionals synthesize the myriad events that transpire on Wall Street everyday. Our thesis on Factset boils down to one theme, really: expansion potential, namely in two areas. The company has considerable potential to grow its overseas business, as well as rip the cover off the ball, if it wanted to, in the lucrative-but-grossly underrated fixed income space. All we hear about in the media -- and especially on this site -- are stocks. But one should never forget bonds, the old gentleman's investment vehicle of choice. Bond flow on the Street is pervasive -- heck, it's what keeps the well-oiled Lehman Brothers (LEH) machine running and snapping its competitors in half like a dry winter twig. We believe that the demand for information services like those provided by FactSet will remain robust. Although it has its fair number of competitors, we're looking at a high-potential market that Factset has thus far excelled in. If Factset meets our criteria, there's nowhere for the company's multiple to go but up. We're initiating coverage with a strong buy rating.

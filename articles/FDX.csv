Additional scale led to improved margins and out-sized growth in operating income.The pandemic has driven online orders and spiked demand for FDX's residential ground services.In the near term, revenue and earnings should continue to grow.At just under 13x EBITDA, FDX appears fairly-valued. I rate the stock a hold.","Source: Barron'sCOVID-19 has led to shelter-in-place policies that have brought the global economy to a practical standstill. I assumed falling economic activity would be bad for transportation stocks like Federal Express (FDX). The decline in global trade was bound to have a negative impact on business activity and deliveries. Business activity may have fallen, yet more orders are being done online, leading to increased deliveries. The pandemic triggered a spike in residential delivery services.In its most recent quarter, FedEx reported revenue of $19.3 billion, up 13% Y/Y.Revenue growth for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground grew 8% and 36%, respectively. FedEx Freight revenue fell in the low-single-digit percentage range. U.S. domestic package volume at FedEx Express and residential delivery services at FedEx Ground were spurred by increased e-commerce demand due to the pandemic:FedEx Ground and FedEx Express represented a combined 86% of total revenue and could potentially drive growth for the rest of the year. FedEx's results seem quirky in that a company that has an image of dominating the old school economy is also thriving in the digital age. The company is almost in the same category as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) as having made a successful transition to a digital world.During the pandemic, consumers have been practically forced to shop online. Eventually, the economy will reopen, which could trigger a decline in online orders. In turn, FedEx's residential delivery services could eventually slow. Shipments of vaccines in 2021 could also provide a short-term boost for revenue. At the end of the day, Q2 GDP fell over 30% and global economic expansion may have been long in the tooth prior to the pandemic. Short-term events could spur revenue, but over the long term, I expect growth for the economy and the transportation sector to remain flat to declining.The increase in scale was bound to have a positive impact on margins. FedEx's cost structure is built for growth. When that growth materializes, then it can create tremendous leverage in the business. Operating income was $1.6 billion, up about 63% Y/Y. Operating income margin was 8.2%, up about 250 basis points versus the year-earlier period.On a segment basis, operating income for each of the company's major operating segments grew in the double-digit percentage range. Operating income for FedEx Express more than doubled to $710 million. FedEx experienced leverage in salaries, maintenance expenses, and fuel costs. If revenue continues to grow, then the company should benefit from the scale and further expand profit margins. Out-sized growth in operating income could be a key narrative going forward. However, it will likely be predicated on the company's ability to grow the top line.Management has expanded FedEx Ground to seven-day delivery. The expansion has likely given the company a leg up on competitors. I originally assumed the economy was not strong enough to justify expanding to a seven-day service. Now that deliveries have ballooned due to online orders, the move appears rather prescient. The company is built for growth. Over the short term, that growth will likely materialize.FedEx has the capital to survive a downturn in the economy. It also has enough capital to make acquisitions to goose growth. The company has $7.0 billion in cash and $7.7 billion in working capital, up from $6.0 billion in May. In the most recent quarter, the company generated free cash flow (""FCF"") of $1.2 billion, up from -$853 million in the year-earlier period. Rising operating income should add to cash flow and liquidity going forward.FDX has an enterprise value of $84.0 billion and trades at 12.6x last 12 months (""LTM"") EBITDA. On the face of it, the valuation appears high for a transportation stock. However, FedEx's near-term opportunity for revenue growth appears attractive. The opportunity for margin expansion and out-sized growth in operating income also appears baked into the valuation. At this juncture, FDX appears fully valued.FDX is up over 75% Y/Y. I rate the stock a hold."
4374892,22201,2020-09-17T10:00:13-04:00,"FedEx is up more than 50% over the past year, and 150% off the 52-week lows.The company is enjoying a huge surge in business and profit margins thanks to the e-commerce wave.However, the company's longer-term problems remain. From this price, reward no longer outweighs risk.","I closed out my FedEx (FDX) position Wednesday. I'd been bullish for the past year, with a cost basis of $163 in my IMF portfolio. With the recent run-up in the stock, including strong earnings this week, the revaluation thesis has played out.FedEx could certainly keep going higher from here. However, if you keep holding FDX stock, you're now betting on an extended growth cycle playing out, instead of simply buying a cheap value stock and waiting for a higher multiple. Here's the details.As you may recall, I bought into FedEx last summer when shares were tanking. You've probably forgotten (I know I had) that the stock was actually down on China trade war concerns at the time, leading to this article:---This is a good reminder is how transitory most news-driven sell offs are. Hardly anyone cares about the trade war anymore. There were specific concerns around China, as China was threatening to block some FedEx operations there as part of retaliation for U.S. tariffs. This bit of short-term noise caused shares dropped from $190 to $158.Unfortunately, FedEx went on to drop significantly further in coming months, as worries shifted back to Amazon (AMZN) and its potential impact on the FedEx/UPS (UPS) duopoly. A break in the FedEx/Amazon contract last winter accelerated fears of upcoming obsolescence. As you probably know, Amazon was building its own rival logistics company that intended to compete with FedEx and UPS.So, to sum up, in 2019, FedEx was down due to both China trade war issues and also the threat that Amazon was going to crush the business. There was also concerns about FedEx's capital allocation, management's focus, and a lack of free cash flow generation.Data by YChartsNormally when you see a chart like this, you'd assume everything is positively surging. And hey, FedEx did report a blow-out quarter this week:SourceHowever, I spent some time re-reading the various bear theses that were being bandied about last year when I was buying the stock -- and honestly -- much of the skeptical argument still holds up now.The company's European division remains a question mark. FedEx has struggled with integration of its TNT purchase there. More broadly, FedEx's capital expenses have soared in recent years -- both in Europe and elsewhere. Will these changes produce steady cash flow, or is what we're seeing now a one-time boost?And the Amazon threat isn't necessarily gone for good either. Yes, Amazon stopped its third-party shipping offering earlier this year. However, it's important to note that Amazon ""paused"" its logistics service rather than canceling it entirely. And please take heed as to why they put the breaks on third-party deliveries:Got that? Amazon suspended the service because it needed that capacity for its own deliveries, rather than having spare capacity to sell to third parties. However, it aggressively staffed up its own logistics and could easily have surplus capacity once again after this holiday season once the retail world starts getting back to normal.The increasing pie of sales going to e-commerce has been beneficial for Amazon, FedEx, and UPS alike. But don't mistake one fantastic year for there necessarily being a lasting truce between rivals.If FedEx were still trading at $160, we'd be having a different discussion. But as it stands today, the stock price has gone up 55%, and meanwhile, earnings are more of an inconclusive picture:Data by YChartsAnalysts see a path to $15-$16/share earnings again going forward again. But will that figure be sustainable? And even that level isn't exactly a blowout number -- earnings have been around that level before, yet FDX stock is now approaching all-time highs again.The free cash flow situation is still far from certain as well. Sure, the current pandemic quarter is going to give this a boost from current low levels. And that will probably remain the case through the end of 2020 at a minimum:Data by YChartsBut what happens in 2021, once e-commerce demand starts to level off and potentially Amazon gets back into the mix? It's still not certain that the TNT integration in Europe or the pension issues that were hitting cash flow from 2016 on are solved matters either.It's one thing to underwrite FDX stock while cognizant of these risks when the stock is down sharply and at 10x normalized earnings. It's another thing to overlook these concerns when the stock is near all-time highs.I don't think FedEx is necessarily a steady compounder now, as it used to be. The company's returns on capital were never especially high and appear to be in a downtrend now. While the pandemic-induced e-commerce boom has given FedEx an absolutely marvelous 2020, I'm not sure that the company will go back to being pre-2016 FedEx once 2021 and 2022 roll around.All that to say that there are probably better things to own at this valuation now than FDX stock. The dividend yield is hardly a reason to hold the stock anymore either. With the share price appreciation, the yield is down to 1.0%. Yet I can't view this as a fast growth company, as I expect my 1.0%-yielding stocks to be. The business simply isn't generating large volumes of consistent free cash flow. Nor am I confident of what the industry looks like in ten or fifteen years.The market is repricing FedEx to be a growth story once again, instead of being a pure value name. And perhaps the Amazon threat disappears, the merger headaches go away, and FedEx proceeds to a new era of record prosperity.That's a decent possibility in fact. It's still a large business with scale in a market with manageable competition. There's a valid bull case here. However it's also a capital intensive business that has made some missteps in recent years.I was willing to pay $160/share for a decent multiple on trough earnings and a shot at a turnaround. Now, however, the market has priced in a complete recovery already. The current price is much more demanding, and there are better opportunities elsewhere. Particularly after a 150% run-up from the March lows, this is a great time to consider cashing in some chips on FedEx.You don't see slopes like that on a large-cap stock very often. | Source: GoogleFedEx shareholders benefited from good fortune this year due to the unprecedented upturn in the e-commerce environment. But don't mistake that for the business fundamentally fixing the issues that had driven it to multi-year lows previously.From a normalized 10x P/E, there were many things that could go correctly to cause a share price run-up. From the current valuation, however, there are far fewer paths that lead to strong investor returns going forward.Meanwhile, many of the problems that led to the market's pessimism are still simmering in the background. Once the current e-commerce boom wears off, we'll see how much of the current uptrend sticks. I doubt FDX stock goes back to last year's levels, but it could easily correct back toward, say, $200, particularly if Amazon restarts its logistics competition."
4375408,105510,2020-09-21T06:57:14-04:00,"FedEx's massive 1Q beat highlights the beginning of a prosperous new dawn.Operating leverage at Ground and Express highlights the margin expansion potential, even if revenue normalizes in a post-COVID world.TNT integration and vaccine distribution opportunity are essentially free options.FedEx remains a great way to play the economic recovery theme.","The extent to which FedEx (FDX) beat expectations in 1Q begs a rather obvious question – can the outperformance continue? In the short term, I think it's a yes. Despite the likely cost headwinds through peak demand in 2Q, the stronger utilization and productivity initiatives at Ground should still drive upside to earnings over the coming quarters. Longer-term, I think COVID has materially altered consumer behavior, and the resulting shift toward e-commerce bodes well for the landscape for parcel carriers. I agree the market appreciates the potential here, and as a result, the stock has re-rated. But given the additional earnings optionality from the TNT integration and COVID vaccine shipments, I think FDX has room to run.As 1Q showed, FDX is handling the changes brought about by COVID better than many had expected. For one, FDX was a clear beneficiary of the surge in e-commerce volumes during the quarter - 1Q daily Ground volumes rose by a massive 31% YoY. Alongside the volume growth, capacity has been particularly tight in International Express, driving 1Q international air freight rev/lb growth (ex-fuel) to +14% YoY. While industry-wide tailwinds were the major revenue driver, management deserves some credit on the cost side, driving impressive margin expansion at ~250bps YoY at the operating margin level.Source: Stat BookAll in all, FDX posted 1QF21 adjusted EPS of $4.87 – significantly above consensus estimates of $2.70. Now, the adjusted numbers do include a ~$130m benefit from an additional operating day and a ~$65m benefit from lower aviation excise taxes, but this nets against ~$100m in COVID-related/safety expenses. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, on the other hand, mainly adjusts for TNT integration expenses (see below).Source: Earnings ReleaseThe Ground segment deserves special mention here - not only did revenue outperform, but it also came with positive incremental margins, which was particularly impressive, in my view. Breaking down the numbers, Ground revenue grew by 36% YoY on strong residential volume growth (volumes rose +31% YoY in 1Q), but Ground cost/piece also moderated to ~3% YoY. This translated into 11.8% (ex-fuel) segmental margins for the quarter, representing significant operating leverage at ~10.7% incremental margins on a YoY basis.Source: Company FilingsThe strong incremental margins result is interesting because it gives us a hint as to how profits will trend when growth begins to normalize post-COVID. That operating leverage turned positive for the first time in quarters indicates margins will remain well-supported from here, in my view. Plus, management's commentary that the Ground network remains flexible enough (due to its contracting structure) to flex according to demand needs is also a key positive.Putting things into perspective, FDX is now guiding toward the US parcel market doubling to 100m packages/day by 2023 in its post-COVID outlook (vs. its prior expectation for 100m by 2026 pre-COVID). Now, I'm not sure how much optimism is embedded in these projections, but it does, at the very least, outline a much stronger revenue backdrop going forward.While Express revenue saw a steady 7.8% YoY growth this time around, the segment's operating margin expansion (on an absolute basis and YoY) was a notable positive. The (ex-TNT) operating margin at 7.7% was ~392bps higher on a YoY basis, as non-GAAP operating income more than doubled YoY to $747m. Strong International Priority and residential package services, as well as meaningful operating leverage, were key drivers behind the segmental margin expansion.Source: Company FilingsIn the short term at least, air capacity continues to be at a premium, which bodes well for the revenue growth trajectory. But I was particularly impressed with the efficiency measures implemented - new aircraft, for instance, should allow the company to operate at a lower cost. The benefits from the TNT acquisition are also trending positively, with the final stage of international air network interoperability expected to be complete in 2022. While I agree Express revenues normalize post-COVID, I think we move to a higher baseline than pre-COVID, and perhaps more importantly, the improved underlying Express margin profile looks to be here to stay.Management held off on official guidance, but the signal was overwhelmingly positive – specifically, commentary around an unusually strong peak season this time around (""like no other"") points toward more outperformance ahead. Based on current trends, FDX looks set for both revenue and profits to be higher across segments for the balance of the year.The increased capex guidance (+$200m to $5.1bn) highlights the demand strength ahead – the added capacity represents a pulling forward of investments to get smaller facilities and equipment up and running in time for the peak season. Naturally, this implies moderation in the capex run-rate post-FY21 coming off a YoY decline from the FY20 peak of $5.9bn.Source: Stat BookThere's something here for catalyst-driven investors as well - with stage three trials underway and potential distribution in October, FDX stands to reap the rewards of the biggest vaccination program in the modern era. Though the US does have domestic vaccine production capabilities, a mass vaccine distribution effort would likely require sourcing from existing global vaccine production centers – ~76% of which takes place in Europe (per 2019 numbers).Source: vaccineseurope.eu via StatistaGiven the needs for the distribution of a time-sensitive, temperature-controlled, and smaller-sized product, the three global integrators (FedEx, UPS (NYSE:UPS), and Deutsche Post (OTCPK:DPSTF)) are obvious fits. Plus, these players already have healthcare-related distribution capabilities in place thanks to prior investments – FDX, for instance, has >90 cold chain facilities globally.Given the demand from the ~330m population in the US alone and the likely need for boosters, the domestic vaccine logistic opportunity could prove to be a multi-year opportunity stretching into the hundreds of millions of dollars. If we were to also account for the rest of the world distribution opportunity as well, I think the optionality here gets very interesting.Lastly, if we were to also account for the second-order effects, the revenue impact could be even more significant. Capacity is already tight, and thus, distributing vaccines would likely mean airfreight markets tightening further, and rates moving much higher. In this regard, timing is key (i.e., whether vaccine distribution occurs during peak season or further down the line).FDX represents a prime way for investors to gain exposure to an improving economy, in my view. Assuming no trade disruptions ahead, I see a clear path toward FDX delivering stronger volumes, margin improvement, and thus, EPS growth. Clearly, there will be some normalization post-COVID, but this is well-understood (see analyst estimates below), and I expect revenue trends to simply reset to a higher baseline going forward.Source: Seeking AlphaWith the vaccine distribution opportunity emerging as well, I think FDX's existing capabilities put it in a prime position to benefit, alongside UPS. In essence, the value of a fully integrated TNT network and the COVID vaccine distribution opportunity represent free options on earnings. Alongside ongoing efficiency improvements, I am net bullish on FDX. Key risks include unforeseen economic and trade headwinds, as well as fuel price fluctuations."
4378756,33291,2020-10-13T01:01:34-04:00,"The COVID-19 disruption appears to have had a mixed impact on operations.We think Prime Day will be a good read for shippers and a proxy for possible holiday action.Continue to expect surges in residential deliveries and encouraging international volume.We believe fiscal 2021 revenues will come in between $76-80 billion, and EPS should be in the $16.25-18.50 range.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingWe have been bullish on shipping names in recent weeks following the uptick in online shopping thanks to the stay-at-home trends produced by COVID-19. FedEx (FDX) is a primary play in this space. Shares have been on the mend since spring and the COVID-19 selloff, and the future looks bright. We think this is a fine long-term play.FedEx has had a number of questionable quarters in recent years, and this has helped keep the pressure on shares compared to where they were a few years ago. However, with the most recent quarter having been reported a few weeks ago and today's Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day looking like it will set records, we think FedEx has legs higher. We like what we see here.Why? Well, the company has just reported a solid set of results. Admittedly this was a tough quarter to handicap but looked strong, while expectations were all over the place. While it was largely expected that sales would be about flat, the consensus expectations were exceeded handily. We believe this is bullish, and with today's Prime Day, shippers should continue to do well as we move into the holiday shopping season.It was widely expected that sales would be about flat thanks to a tough start to Q1 with improvement over the summer. Well, revenue was $19.32 billion, rising a big 13.3% year over year and beating estimates by $1.7 billion. These revenues of course rose from the $17.1 billion a year ago. That was a strong positive we thought. Performance was of course affected by the COVID-19 pandemic impacting all revenue and expense line items during the quarter. While commercial volumes were down significantly due to business closures across the globe, there were surges in residential deliveries that really drove this better-than-expected number, and strength in international activity as well.On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $4.72 per diluted share for the fiscal first quarter compared to a gain of $2.84 per diluted share last year, so that is a strong improvement. Of course, we need to consider adjustments when comparing year over year and as such adjusted operating income was positive, coming in at $1.64 billion, and this was up big from $1.05 billion last year. This result saw a benefit from operating margins of 8.5%, well above consensus in the mid-6% range. Adjusted earnings were $4.87 per share, crushing expectations by $2.15.The growing divergence in segment performance was notable. Segment-specific results were very telling. We thought that commercial volumes would be down a touch due to business closures a bit across the globe but not nearly as poor as we saw in fiscal Q4. But we also saw big increases in residential deliveries at FedEx Ground and in transpacific and charter flights at FedEx Express. Of course, these have associated costs to serve customers.One source of ongoing costs has been the TNT Express integration. This is a multi-year process. We think that you can continue to expect that FedEx will have a lot of expenses for the next two years as the company continues the integration of TNT Express. It is expensive.Many of the adjusted metrics reported adjust for the significant TNT Express integration expenses. These adjustments are made as the expenses aren't part of the so-called normal operations.They include professional and legal fees, salaries and employee benefits, travel and advertising expenses. It is expected that the company will continue to see some pressure on GAAP results thanks to this. So it is something to keep in mind going forward.The COVID-19 disruption appears to have had a mixed impact on operations. We believe the stay-at-home trend will continue this year, and that will benefit the residential deliveries that have spiked. Operating results in Q1 increased due to volume growth in FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services, yield improvement at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight but were partially offset by costs to support strong demand and to expand services, variable compensation expenses, and COVID-19-related costs incurred to ensure the safety of FedEx employees. That said, we expect the Q2 and Q3 to see similar benefits that Q1 saw thanks to COVID. We think Prime Day will be a good read for shippers and a proxy for possible holiday action. The company did not provide an earnings forecast and truthfully it is very tough to see where things are going but we have bullish estimates for this year. We believe fiscal 2021 revenues will come in between $76-80 billion, and EPS should be in the $16.25-18.50 range. This puts the stock in the 16-X18X forward EPS range, which is not overvalued in our opinion. We think the stock moves higher.If you like the material and want to see more, click ""Follow"" and if you want guidance from a professional trading team, check out BAD BEAT Investing below."
4375144,65113,2020-09-18T11:37:42-04:00,"FedEx Corporation has seen strong growth in large part due to ongoing mobility restrictions as a result of COVID-19.That said, capital expenditures and long-term debt continue to grow.The company could see lower demand when mobility restrictions from COVID-19 start to ease, and earnings could come under some pressure from that point.","Back in late 2018, I made the argument that FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) would continue to see upside over the longer term. At the time, the stock had seen a significant price drop due to concerns over lackluster earnings along with the threat of competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In spite of a continued decline after that point, the stock has shot back up to nearly pre-2018 levels since March:Source: Investing.comMoreover, the company just released a strong set of results for Q1 2021, which included a 66% growth in diluted EPS on a GAAP basis as compared to the last fiscal year.Source: FedEx Q1 FY21 Earnings Release FinalCOVID-19 and associated lockdowns have resulted in a large surge in online shopping, and this has been reflected in strong volume growth for FedEx International Priority and U.S. domestic residential package services. While this was partially offset by costs of expanding delivery services, the company has seen significant earnings growth.However, a strong caveat is that FedEx is reportedly not taking the integration expenses of TNT Express into account for fiscal 2021 and 2020, citing that ""we generally would not incur such expenses as part of our continuing operations"".Moreover, when analysing the company's financial highlights in more detail, we can see that it has reported a 35% decrease in fuel costs from last year, which is in large part due to lower transportation demand as a result of COVID-19:Source: FedEx Q1 FY21 Earnings Release FinalAdditionally, we can see that most of the revenue growth (36%) for the company came from the Ground segment which specialises in the delivery of low-weight and low time-sensitive business-to-customer packages. On the other hand, the company's largest segment - FedEx Express - grew by 8%. Even with increased demand for remote delivery, growth for this segment remained in the single digits.Notwithstanding the company's growth success throughout the pandemic, this could be a risk factor going forward. This segment accounts for a large portion of the overall operating expenses, and this is set to increase further with the integration of TNT Express.When global lockdowns are inevitably eased at some point and global mobility starts to return to some form of normality, the question must be asked as to whether FedEx will start to see a decline from that point, as an upturn in mobility results in lower demand for delivery services. This is a legitimate concern when one considers that the stock had been trending lower in any case up until COVID-19 struck.One concern among investors with the stock is the negative growth in free cash flow. For instance, we can see that since 2019 - in spite of the growth that FedEx has witnessed as a result of COVID-19 - growth in capital expenditures has still outpaced that of free cash flow.Source: YChartsAdditionally, while it is encouraging that the company has seen a reduction in its debt-to-equity ratio this year, it still remains quite higher than that of 2018, indicating that it is increasingly relying on debt to sustain operations.Source: YChartsSource: FedEx Q1 FY21 Earnings Release FinalAdditionally, we can see from the balance sheet that long-term debt less the current portion is up by 5.7% in the past quarter, while the current portion of long-term debt is up by 70%. To clarify, the current portion of long-term debt refers to the portion of long-term debt that must be paid off in the next 12 months.Source: FedEx Q1 FY21 Earnings Release FinalCash and cash equivalents are up by 42%, which is encouraging and indicates that FedEx is generating enough cash to cover the debt. That said, should we continue to see growth in long-term debt without a corresponding growth in cash, then this could be a cause for concern.Let's take a look at the company's EV/EBITDA ratio.On a one-year basis, we see that growth in EBITDA per share has comfortably outpaced that of the EV/EBITDA ratio.Source: YChartsThat said, let's now look on a 10-year basis.Source: YChartsWe now see that growth in EV/EBITDA has just slightly outpaced the growth in EBITDA per share. From a longer-term perspective, while the gains that the stock has shown since March are quite impressive, FedEx is in many respects simply making up for lost growth since 2018.In the near term, I anticipate that the slowdown in global mobility from COVID-19 will continue to mean heightened demand for FedEx's services. With that being said, growth in the stock may start to peak towards the end of the year, and growing integration costs from TNT Express could put pressure on earnings going forward.In conclusion, my view is that the stock could come under pressure going forward as costs associated with TNT Express start to rise and lockdowns gradually start to be lifted - even if we see a more restrictive winter ahead. Moreover, the company is seeing an increase in its long-term debt levels as part of sustaining its operations, and investors should note whether FDX is continuing to raise enough cash to fund such long-term debt. In light of the this, I take a neutral view on the stock at this point in time. If I were an investor, I wouldn't be inclined to sell the company. To its credit, FedEx has clearly shown buoyant growth in this pandemic. That said, should FedEx start to see a plateau in such growth, then there is risk of downside in the stock, which may lead to a more lukewarm reception on the part of investors when considering further upside."

(Click on the excel spreadsheet to expand the insert and take a look at cash-flow, capex and free-cash-flow.)Over the last 14 quarters, FedEx's free-cash-flow (trailing twelve-month) has been negative for 12 of those quarters.This is part and parcel to the 2 years of negative EPS revisions too.Fred Smith has acknowledged the issue, but with the global pandemic it's only become worse.Any company with the operating leverage of a FedEx (like an airline) sees free-cash-flow evaporate during volume downturns like FedEx is seeing now.The Ground segment and the 25% growth in e-commerce B-to-C deliveries in fiscal Q4 '20 is helping stave off the pressure in Express and Freight.Source: Worden technical softwareNote the sharp spike in the stock price after the June 30 '20 earnings release.Source: YchartsHere is FedEx's relative performance versus the S&P 500 since the peak in the stock 12/31/17.Source: YchartsHere is a graph from Ycharts showing FedEx's stock price performance year-to-date as of 9/11/20.The only thing readers probably want to know is can the stock momentum continue, and given the EPS and revenue revisions (look at first two attachments above), the Street is guessing it can.The ""average"" expected EPS growth for FedEx over the next three years is now 16% on an ""expected"" 5% revenue growth, and trading at an 18x multiple, which is probably why the Street has been so bullish into this coming release on Tuesday night.At least 6 sells-side firms raised their target price or valuation on FedEx on July 1 '20, putting a new valuation between $160 - $180 on the stock.The current price near $230 remains well above those levels again.Previewing the fiscal Q4 '20 earnings release on the blog in late June, the revisions were still negative and the Street was very cautious.This should tell readers much about ""expectations"" coming into an earnings call.FDX was up 1.5% today on double the average volume, as optimism reigns coming into the call.Clients still own the exact same position in FedEx they have owned all year."
4364624,103373,2020-08-05T10:40:17-04:00,FedEx stock has risen +20% after the Q4 2020 earnings call.The recent price increase is not validated by strong underlying metrics.The company is still dealing with multiple challenges and there's more than a little risk involved in investing at this price right now.,"Despite two of its three operating segments showing sales declines on the back of COVID-19-related impact on businesses around the world, FedEx Corporation (FDX) stock is trading, as of this writing, at more than 20% up since the Q4-2020 earnings call at the beginning of last month. A lot of its market capitalization that was lost over the past year and a half or so has been regained and the stock is now trading at pre-December-2018 levels. Looking deeper, it's clear that FedEx is now depending on the one remaining pillar that COVID-19 wasn't able to damage: B2C shipments, which are a part of FedEx Ground.Thesis: Although there's strong traction with B2C shipment growth in the U.S. domestic segment and some gains in international outbound, the recent price increase is not validated by strong underlying metrics. HOLD for now.FedEx's second-largest segment by revenue raked in $22.7 billion in FY-20 for a YoY increase of 11%. However, the additional revenue came with additional cost as well, pushing operating margin down to under 9% from the 13% margin posted for FY-19, a decline of more than 400 basis points.Growth in this segment primarily came from elevated levels of B2C shipments. It is of interest to note that, while FedEx and its chief rival UPS (UPS) both experienced declines in commercial ground shipments, the latter's performance actually improved in that area over its Q2-20 months, indicating significant sequential growth in B2B deliveries.Source: UPS Q2-20 Earnings PresentationIn contrast, that's something FedEx doesn't quantify in any of its reports for Q4-20. However, FedEx Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Brie Carere, did hint at recovery for B2B at the Q4-20 earnings call:Another area where FedEx hasn't been able to take full advantage of a golden opportunity is the Express International segment. FedEx only recorded a minor uptick in average daily package volume in International, while UPS reported an 11.4% increase. Per FedEx's 10-K filing for FY-20:Source: FedEx 10-K Filing for FY2020In contrast, UPS saw continued growth across all export segments in the second quarter, with Europe and U.S. exports still showing strong YoY volume growth as the company exited Q2-20. Per UPS CFO Brian Newman:Source: UPS Q2-20 Earnings PresentationThe one positive aspect for FedEx in relation to UPS's figures is revenue per piece. FedEx reported a 0.4% dip in revenue per package for the year, while UPS recorded a much steeper 4.4% for its Q2-20. It is likely that the dip in the final quarter will have been much steeper, but the impact on overall revenue per package for the full fiscal has been minimal for FedEx.The outlook for FedEx Ground remains positive, but a lot of the gains from investing in coverage expansion, new sort facilities, etc. in FY-20 are only expected to yield mature results during the second half of FY21, as indicated in the FY-20 10-K Filing:UPS already has greater network efficiencies on the ground, which means FedEx will be playing catch-up through the first half of FY-21 and only see incremental gains from its own initiatives during the period. By the second half of FY-21, B2C shipment volumes may not be at the highly elevated levels they are now. Even if they are, UPS will have grabbed much of that market share. That's true of both domestic B2C shipments as well as International B2C exports.The hit to FedEx's bottom line was more pronounced during the fourth quarter, but the overall decline in operating margin for the full fiscal came in at -290 basis points, from 6.4% to 3.5%.Source: 10-K FilingAs a result of higher operating expenses during FY-20, the company plans to engage in some deft financial engineering for FY-21. This includes:FedEx needs to take these somewhat extreme measures because its free cash flows for the past few quarters have been heavily weighed on by CapEx investments, primarily toward its aging air fleet.Meanwhile, FedEx continues to be challenged with the TNT Express integration:That also means that the segment's ability to fight for market share growth is also delayed by a couple of quarters. It also worsens the impact of the pandemic on an already margin-tight segment, the operating income for which declined 54% through FY-20.I don't see FedEx as a safe investment for total returns at this price point. Much of the +20% price increase since the release of Q4 earnings at the end of June has been contributed to by two factors: EPS growth without significant efficiency gains, and a positive outlook for domestic B2C shipments in the United States that the company hasn't been able to fully capture. There have been gains in outbound volumes from Europe and Asia-Pacific, but the company has acknowledged that ""air cargo capacity recovery will take at least 18 months to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.""Data by YChartsThe stock price increase is disproportionate to any material gains made at the top line, which indicates that there may be a price correction imminent.There's no doubt that FedEx will be able to overcome its integrational, financial, and operational challenges over the next several quarters. For now, however, the double-impact of poor cash flows and COVID-19 make this a risky stock to bet on if you're looking for significant total returns. HOLD for now."
4370382,54272,2020-08-24T08:19:00-04:00,"Early in January, when other analysts/investors covering FedEx were concerned about a potential pricing war due to Amazon’s entry in logistics, I argued that those concerns were unfounded.Amazon has suspended its third-party logistics operations, removing any supply concerns while eCommerce adoption has accelerated due to COVID-19.FedEx can continue to see upside as the market better appreciates the company’s pricing power.","FedEx’s (FDX) stock has seen a good run up since my last article in January. Back then, the company was facing significant bearish sentiments with investors worried about Amazon’s (AMZN) foray into the logistics business. Out of the 11 articles published on Seeking Alpha in a month before my January article, only one was bullish. Most of the other articles were based around the argument that Amazon’s entry in logistics space will be a significant blow to FedEx and UPS (UPS) as Amazon will drive down pricing in order to gain market share. They even cited a ban implemented by Amazon on the use of FedEx Ground for prime shipments to illustrate the competitive tactics Amazon was using to outcompete FedEx.To me, it didn’t make any sense. Why would Amazon like to compete with FedEx and drive down pricing in the logistics industry? This move will only help its eCommerce and omnichannel competitors who will be able to ship for less. Amazon’s core business is retail not logistics and it is unlikely to do anything to help its retail competitors. Below is the relevant excerpt from my January 14th article,My theory proved correct. A few hours after my article was published, the Wall Street Journal reported about Amazon lifting ban on FedEx Ground. A couple of months later, Amazon announced that it is suspending its third-party delivery service competing with UPS and FedEx. And while the word ""suspended"" was used, I believe Amazon has exited this business for good. Any expansion in this business would have only helped Amazon’s retail competitor and would have been a very foolish move.Fast forward, air-freight business has now returned to being a duopoly without any threat from the entry of a large player. COVID-19 has accelerated eCommerce adoption and has increased the demand for transportation services and Amazon’s exit has removed any threat of potential oversupply. So, we have a perfect demand-supply scenario for FedEx and UPS. As expected, both have started increasing prices by levying significant surcharges.In April, FedEx implemented a global temporary surcharge on all FedEx Express and TNT International parcel and air freight shipments to balance the demand against air cargo capacity.In early June, FedEx announced that the company was implementing three temporary surcharges, including a SmartPost surcharge of $0.40 per package, an oversized surcharge of $30 per package, and a residential delivery charge of $0.30 per package to offset incremental expenses incurred in its networks.In August, the company announced more surcharges and boosted international surcharge. UPS announced similar increases and surcharges.While FedEx has mentioned that surcharges will last till January 2021, there was a good amount of discussion about how the company is taking steps to improve revenue quality (read increase pricing) on its last earnings call.I believe the pricing will continue to move upward even if surcharges end and FedEx will see an increase in core pricing for the next several years. We might see something similar to what has happened in the railroad industry over the last decade. Most of the railroads have essentially two players competing on the major routes. They have seen a very rational pricing environment implementing pricing increases above inflation for over a decade now. I see similar dynamics playing out in the Air-Freight industry as well which is a duopoly now with both FedEx and UPS being rational players.I am a big fan of transportation companies that can implement core pricing increases with ease. While volume gains are also interesting, they always have costs associated with handling them. The benefit of core pricing increase is it almost completely flows to the bottom line without any significant associated cost. I believe FedEx is likely to enter that phase.This changes the whole valuation argument around FedEx. At the beginning of this year, investors were concerned about Amazon's threat and were assigning a low P/E multiple to FedEx, citing looming price war. But now investors are warming up to a multiyear pricing increase story. Most of the railroads trade around 20x P/E given the limited competition and pricing power. I believe FedEx deserves a similar multiple. The current consensus EPS estimate for FY 2022 is $12.61 with a Street high estimate at $14.85. I believe there is a good scope of upward revision in consensus estimate as the company’s pricing story becomes more evident. However, even if we use the current consensus estimate of $12.61 and apply a P/E multiple of 20x, we get a target price of $252 which represents ~20% upside. So, I maintain my buy rating on the stock.Now some investors might ask - almost similar arguments can be applied for UPS as well. So, is it a good buy too? I do believe UPS is a buy. However, UPS has a unionized workforce and a much higher Amazon exposure. Both of them are difficult to negotiate with. So, I prefer FedEx."
4361443,105014,2020-07-28T15:07:24-04:00,"Lower operating results and FCF are the reasons for a valuation gap.
        The COVID-19 pandemic is providing a tailwind.
        FDX is addressing operational inefficiency and FCF concerns.","About a year ago, I wrote an article on FedEx (FDX) when its shares were trading at around $160, roughly the same level as today. The thesis of that article was that FDX is undervalued by as much as 47%, mostly because FDX was trading at lower multiples compared to its peers. The article further pointed out that there were no near-term catalysts to help close the valuation gap. There were other concerns that investors have regarding the efficiency and FCF of FDX as well. Serendipitously, the COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging many different industries is providing a tailwind and has created catalysts for FDX. FDX is also addressing most of investors’ concerns. As a result, it is likely that the valuation gap will close within the next twelve to eighteen months as these catalysts continue to play out and improve the results of FDX. This article will provide a description of the tailwind and the improvements that FDX has made within the last year.As a reminder, in the previous article, I compared the valuation of FDX’s three different segments, Express, Ground and Freight, with their respective peers. The peers are UPS (UPS) for Express and Ground, and a host of LTL freight companies for Freight. The analysis valued FDX in the range of $240 to $300 per share. Another way to look at the valuation gap is that Ground and Freight combined are worth around $160 per share, meaning that investors are getting Express for free.The investor concerns raised by the previous article were: while Ground continues to grow, Express’s results were spotty especially in Europe; the TNT integration is taking longer and costing more and there are still execution risks in the TNT integration; FDX’s margins are structurally lower than that of UPS due to the three segments do not share assets and IT because of their silo structure, resulting in higher cost and higher level of investment; FDX’s FCF has been dwindling with continued heavy investment in capex, resulting in FDX levering the balance sheet as it borrows to fund dividend payment and share buy-back. This article will provide an update on how FDX and the tailwind are addressing these concerns.The revenue trend of FDX’s three segments is shown in Figure 1. The FY2020 revenues for Express were impacted by the pandemic, due to business closures in China in 3Q, followed by business closures in the US and EU in late 3Q and early 4Q. However, the revenues in Ground continued to grow, driven by B2C shipment due to significant increase in eCommerce. This trend accelerated in 4Q. B2B shipment declined in 4Q but the decline was more than offset by the increase in B2C shipment. While 4Q revenue result was mixed, FDX reported in its FY4Q2020 that the trend exiting 4Q was very encouraging.Figure 1: Segment revenues results. Source: 10-K reports. Note: Fiscal year ends May 31.For Express, total intercontinental volume exited May with a YoY growth. While Asia Pacific volume, led by China, slumped in 3Q, it rebounded strongly starting mid-March where daily volume grew over pre-pandemic level, driven by shipment of personnel protection equipment “PPE”. European outbound volume also grew in the transatlantic lane due to drastic shrinkage in cargo capacity on commercial passenger airlines as well as increase in eCommerce. Similarly, Asia volume continued to strengthen throughout 4Q against a backdrop of shrinking commercial passenger airline capacity. The increased demand resulted in an increase in 4Q flight hours of 2.6% YoY versus a planned decline of 7%. FDX was able to implement a temporary surcharge on all Express and TNT international parcel and air freight shipments in April. Management expects that this tailwind of capacity constrain will continue as it might take eighteen months for the commercial passenger air traffic to return to normal.For Ground, eCommerce’s explosive growth continues to drive B2C volume growth, partly offset by a reduction in B2B volume. B2B volume, however, started to recover in April. B2C yield remains above market even among large customers as the explosive growth in eCommerce highlights the value of Ground’s capacity. In early June, FDX announced that it is implementing temporary surcharges for SmartPost, over-sized package, and residential delivery, especially for its largest customers who are seeing surging growth in B2C eCommerce volume.The pandemic, which is driving these trends, has not shown any sign of relenting. It will probably take a vaccine before the pandemic can moderate. At best, based on currently available information, it will be 1Q2021 before any vaccine can be deployed. After initial deployment, it will take many months for the benefit of the vaccine to take hold. Even then, it will probably take months for commercial passenger air traffic to normalize. The convenience of shopping online and having their goods delivered to their door will have become a habit for the consumers that the eCommerce trend will likely continue. It is very likely as well that FDX will be able to charge a better yield for its capacity given a continued supply demand balance favoring FDX.While Express has been hampered by a continued recession in the EU, the recent agreement for a 1.28 trillion Euro COVID-19 recovery fund and budget brightens the outlook for the European economy. Perhaps the pandemic has finally galvanized the EU leaders to act in a concerted effort to stimulate its economy. When Europe’s economy recovers, it will greatly benefit Express/TNT.The TNT integration has been a painful multiyear episode for FDX, but the end is in sight. While the finish line has been moved out a bit due to the pandemic, management reported that the integration should be completed by early 2022. Even before the completion of the integration, FDX should be able to realize improved revenue and profitability. While execution risks still exist, I believe that the risk profile has significantly decreased. The integration expense for FY2021 is expected to be around $170 million and it will be significantly lower in FY2022. It has been a long journey, and it will take another 18 months to complete, but investors can look forward to Express better positioned to compete for market share.FDX has taken a step to address the inefficiency caused by its silo structure. FDX announced in the FY3Q2020CC that Express will be contracting with Ground for the transportation and delivery of select day-definite Express residential packages in the US. This was rolled out in March in one city, and is expected to be rolled out to other cities in the ensuing twelve months. I have argued in the previous article that while the silo structure is not efficient from an asset utilization stand point, integrating Express and Ground assets, network and IT is too disruptive to the business and is a very risky proposition. The approach that FDX has taken to use Ground’s assets for some Express’ transportation and delivery is a feasible solution to address the efficiency issue. FDX has not indicated the end goal of this transition, but I am hopeful that the end goal will lead to a much more efficient use of FDX’s assets and will result in a higher ROA, higher profitability and lower capex. The transition, however, will take years. It is something investors should continue to cheer FDX on.FCF has been dwindling as a result of heavy capex investment in the last several years. This is shown in Figure 2. The heavy capex investment is driven, in large part, by the need to replace 159 very old and inefficient aircrafts.Figure 2: FDX has been running a negative FCF for several years. Source: 10-K.The original plan was to complete the aircraft replacement by the end of FY2022. In the latest update, FDX has decided to push out the replacement completion to FY2025, but the bulk of the capex will be completed by FY2024. In doing so, FDX will reduce the capex requirement of FY2021 by $1 billion to about $4.9 billion. The cash flow from operations in FY2020 was $5.1 billion. With the improvement in yield, the continued growth in Ground, a small recovery of Express volume and no expected requirement to contribute to the pension fund, my model shows that the FY2021 cash flow from operations can be in a range of between $6.4 to $7 billion. If this does occur, FDX will have more than sufficient FCF to cover the dividend and even can buy back some shares or de-lever the balance sheet.There are still some concerns and risks. For one, Ground’s margin deteriorated from 13% in FY2019 to 8.9% in FY2020. This margin reduction is driven in large part by the heavy investment in Sunday delivery. Investors are wondering as to when Ground will deliver improved results from this investment. Management did not provide a definitive forecast. The biggest leverage will come when the volume catches up with the increased capacity. Management is not willing to commit to such a schedule. However, I do believe that the continued growth in eCommerce will fill the added capacity. FDX announced the addition of Sunday delivery in January, 2020, and invested ahead of revenue. By adding Sunday, FDX added about 14% to its capacity, using very simple math. Since Ground’s volume grew about 11% in FY2020, it will take over a year to fill that additional capacity, everything else being equal. One thing that will help to fill that capacity is the continued integration of SmartPost packages into the standard Ground operation, which is expected to be completed in the next six months. Meanwhile, margin will start to improve with improved utilization and yield.While the pandemic is providing a tailwind for FDX, the same pandemic could cause a protracted economic downturn. FDX’s volume growth is correlated strongly with GDP growth. Hence a protracted downturn will impact not only volume, but yield as well. Hopefully, the governments and central banks of major countries will continue to deploy the proper fiscal and monetary policies to help their countries to navigate a recession. However, the longer the pandemic lasts, the higher the risk of a recession.The US has been retreating from globalization. This retreat started in January 2018 with the beginning of tariffs on imported solar panels and then were expanded to other goods. The tariffs hit our trade with the EU, China, and other trading partners. This retreat has hurt Express’ volume. The sentiment of the country appears to favor a retreat. If the retreat continues, it will continue to be a headwind.FDX is undervalued by as much as 47% compared to its peers primarily because of lower multiples caused by investors’ concerns of poor results of Express, the risks and cost of the TNT integration, the negative FCF due to heavy investment in capex, and the heavy investment in Ground’s seven-day delivery. The pandemic has provided a tailwind for both Express and Ground, and management is making changes to address the cost, structural and FCF concerns. These are catalysts that will help to close the valuation gap as they play out in the next twelve to eighteen months."
4355543,20715,2020-06-25T03:57:35-04:00,FedEx will release fiscal fourth quarter earnings results on Tuesday.Earnings have been declining in recent years and Q4 is expected to drop by 62% compared to the same quarter of 2019.The stock is in a downward sloped trend channel at this time and it is near the upper rail of the channel.,"The last few years have not been good ones for FedEx (FDX) shareholders. In June ’18, the stock was flirting with $260 and here it is at approximately half that level now - and that’s after rallying 50% from its low in March.If you are looking for a reason for the decline, look no further than the earnings declining. When I first wrote about FedEx here on Seeking Alpha, the company reported EPS of $3.03 and that was in March ’19. In the three quarters prior to that report, FedEx reported EPS of $5.91, and then $4.03 for the next two quarters.In June ’19, the company did see a little spike in earnings and reported $5.01 for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019. Since then, the EPS numbers have been $3.09, $2.51, and $1.41.FedEx is set to report next week and that will be the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $1.90 per share this time around and that is sharply lower than the $5.01 reported in Q4 2019. Third quarter results showed a decline of 53% from the previous year and if the analysts' estimates are accurate, we are looking at a decline in earnings of 62% compared to last year.Because of previous articles I have written and being a bit of a data hoarder, I was able to go back and look at old stats on FedEx. I use Investor’s Business Daily for a lot of my fundamental data and use IBD’s EPS rating and SMR ratings as a quick reference to see how a company is doing compared to other companies. I went back and looked at different dates where I had the EPS and SMR ratings for FedEx and you see the gradual decline in terms of the EPS rating.Revenue is expected to come in at $16.56 billion and that is 7% lower than what we saw in 2019. The revenue numbers have held up better than the earnings numbers and revenue has actually grown by 7% per year over the last three years. Revenue was up 3% in the third quarter.The company’s management efficiency measurements have been declining as well. The return on equity is at 2.9% and the profit margin is at 0.77%. In my first article about FedEx, I had the ROE at 23.5% and the profit margin was at 8.0%.The stock is trading with a trailing P/E of 371 and a forward P/E of 13.5. The dramatic difference between those two valuation metrics reflect the big decline in earnings and what analysts expect going forward.Looking at the weekly chart for FedEx, we see how the stock has dropped so drastically in the last few years. We also see how a trend channel has formed that defines the various cycles within the overall downward trend.The stock just hit its 52-week moving average a few weeks ago and it turned lower from there. The upper rail of the channel is right on top of the 52-week and that could make it twice as hard for the stock to break that trend.Another factor that concerns me about the chart is how the weekly stochastic indicators just made a bearish crossover as they were hitting overbought territory. Over the last couple of years, such bearish crossovers have been bad signs for the stock. We saw one in April ’19 and another one in June ’18.In my article back in March, I noted how oversold the stock was based on the monthly chart, but the big rally over the last three months has moved the 10-month RSI and the monthly stochastic indicators out of oversold territory.Even without me drawing it, you can probably visualize the trend line that connects the highs from the last year.With FedEx’s earnings on the decline and with the stock trending lower, sentiment toward the stock has become more bearish in the last 15 months. When I wrote the article in March ’19, there were 28 analysts following the company with 24 of them rating the stock as a “buy.” Now there are 27 analysts following the stock and only 13 rank the stock as a “buy.” The other 14 rank the stock as a “hold.” If we look at the ratings in terms of the buy percentage, it has fallen from 85.7% to 48.1%.The short interest ratio is at 2.0 currently and that is somewhat low for a stock that has performed as poorly as FedEx. Looking back at the four previous articles that I have written about the stock, the ratio has ranged from 1.8 to 2.4 over the course of the last 15 months.The put/call ratio is at 0.897 currently and that is slightly below average compared to other stocks. The ratio was at 0.88 in March when the company reported third quarter earnings results.While analysts have become more pessimistic on FedEx, short sellers and option traders have remained somewhat neutral. To me it seems like this could hurt FedEx as there isn’t enough pessimism toward the stock for a contrarian shift. One of the reasons I look at the sentiment indicators is to find companies with extreme levels of pessimism that can cause a shift in the stock. The sentiment toward FedEx isn’t pessimistic enough to cause such a shift in my opinion.To me it looks like the rally for FedEx since March was simply based on what the overall market did. It had very little to do with FedEx itself. Even with the huge rally, the stock is still in a long-term downward trend, a 50% rally wasn’t even enough to break it out of the trend.The fundamentals continue to decline and who knows when those will turn around. It seems like the company is getting hit from all sides. Amazon has decreased the amount of business it does with FedEx, the global slowdown from the pandemic is hurting the business, and the ongoing trade disputes are hurting as well. I thought FedEx might see a little boost in usage from the pandemic, but that doesn’t appear to be the case based on the company’s current guidance.FedEx does pay a dividend and it’s currently at $0.65 per quarter. There hasn’t been anything announced or speculated about cutting the dividend, so it appears to be safe for now. At the current stock price, we are talking about a yield of 1.9%.All in all, there are just too many negative factors to suggest buying FedEx at this time. I see the downward trend on the chart continuing and the fundamentals continuing to weaken. It is going to take a strong reversal in the earnings and the revenue to get the stock out of the current downward trend and I just don’t see that happening in the current economic environment."
4356665,23179,2020-07-01T23:24:02-04:00,It is not too late to take a long-term position in this leading air freight and logistics company.I believe investors looking for total return with a dividend kicker might want to take a closer look at FedEx as a long-term investment.FAST Graph Analyze Out Loud Video reviewing FedEx.,"After reporting better-than-expected 4th quarter results on Tuesday, the stock price of FedEx Corp. (FDX) has been on a tear. With this article, I plan to demonstrate that the fundamentals support the current price rise. Moreover, the fundamentals also suggest that it is not too late to take a long-term position in this leading air freight and logistics company.Yesterday, FedEx reported a surge in quarterly adjusted earnings of $2.53 per share compared to expectations of $1.52 per share. Even though these earnings were almost 50% lower compared to the same period last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, they were obviously well ahead of expectations.The pandemic really hurt FedEx’s global trade and commercial business-to-business shipments for both Express and Ground, and additionally weakened the company’s light truckload volumes. These headwinds exacerbated the lost Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue that FedEx intentionally relinquished last year. Nevertheless, the 4th quarter report produced signs of progress and the re-establishment of long-term future growth once the current pandemic is over.However, as Morningstar pointed out, the pandemic has accelerated the broader shift to e-commerce sales for large retailers, which it suggested materially drove up demand for residential businesses to consumer package deliveries. As a result, Ground saw a staggering 25% jump in average daily packages and residential deliveries ballooned to 75% of US sales for the quarter. This contrasted with 56% of sales a year ago. Morningstar also reported that, and I quote “express’ Asia outbound and Europe outbound volumes strengthened in the quarter, as unusually tight industry capacity (limited commercial-airline belly space) is boosting demand for FedEx’s airlift assets.”With the following slide from FedEx’s earnings presentation you can clearly see the importance of these improvements by examining the relative contribution of Express and Ground to FedEx’s overall business:Furthermore, FedEx also presented the following reasons why the company believes that it is well-positioned to continue to produce long-term growth:Later, I will illustrate how the leading analysts following the company expect these initiatives and projections will lead to growth of future earnings and cash flows.Furthermore, as is often the case, analyst expectations are guided by the company’s expectations. The following slide presents FedEx’s long-term financial goals presented by management. Personally, I believe that the most important goal is for the company to improve its cash flows, specifically free cash flow going forward. As I will also illustrate later, negative free cash flow since fiscal year 2017 does represent a negative in my humble opinion:With the following video I intend to illustrate several important fundamental considerations regarding FedEx. First and foremost, the company is a poster child representing how stock price follows fundamentals in the long run. The following screenshot clearly shows how price goes where earnings go, up or down in the long run.This is extremely important as my associate Dividend Sensei of the Dividend Kings pointed out as follows:According to research from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Princeton, only 9% of 12-month returns are explained by valuation/fundamentals. However, the number increases to 45% over 5-year time frames and most importantly, valuation/fundamentals account for 90% of 10-year returns.In the case of FedEx, as I showed above, and as I will demonstrate in the video, valuation is currently aligned with fundamentals, and as previously stated, fundamental growth is expected to return in the future. Therefore, I consider FedEx an interesting long-term total return candidate based on those attributes. However, in the video I also point out some negatives that investors considering FedEx should contemplate.As of the time I am writing this article, FedEx’s stock price is trading at approximately $157 a share. The forecasting graph below shows that to only be slightly above yesterday’s closing stock price when you look at it graphically. The change is approximately 12%, nevertheless, the graphic below shows that there is still plenty of opportunity left in FedEx over the next couple of years. Bottom line, I believe investors looking for total return with a dividend kicker might want to take a closer look at FedEx as a long-term investment."
4355402,39011,2020-06-24T12:00:17-04:00,"FDX has rebounded nicely from its panic lows.However, it has structural issues in trying to stay relevant in an intensely competitive field.With the stock fully valued and a host of other issues, FedEx is a sell.","Image sourceWhile many companies have seen their business model sustain temporary or permanent damage from COVID-19, others have seen demand for their services rise during these unprecedented times. One industry that has done quite well during the crisis is shipping companies with leverage to the burgeoning home delivery market.FedEx (FDX) has long been a huge player in many different types of logistics solutions, and that remains the case today. However, I think FedEx faces structural challenges, mostly from Amazon (AMZN), that will keep it from achieving its long-term growth goals. As a result, while the stock has fallen precipitously in the past two years, I see it only at fair value today, and nowhere near cheap. When other challenges are considered, I think investors should pass on FedEx given it is unattractive for new money.FedEx has, for some time, touted very impressive long-term financial goals. The company reckons it can grow revenue profitably, boost operating margins significantly over current levels, improve its cash generation, and grow EPS by 10% to 15% annually.Source: Investor presentationThese are extremely lofty goals, and if FedEx were able to hit them, the stock would be quite valuable at current levels. However, I see some problems that not only make these goals look tough to hit, but downright unattainable.First, let’s take a look at revenue generation, as that is key to just about any company’s EPS growth, and is the case with FedEx.Source: Seeking AlphaRevenue has grown nicely in recent years, rising from $48 billion in 2015 to an estimate $69 billion for the just-ended fiscal year, which FedEx will report at the end of this month. That is impressive and is owed in part to its Ground business, which has grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2001.However, as we can see, revenue this year is expected to be somewhat less than last year, and the story is essentially the same for fiscal 2021. With e-commerce volumes soaring due to COVID-19, and FedEx possessing enviable leverage to the at-home delivery market, you’d probably expect that revenue should see a meaningful rise this year. That isn’t the case, however, and I honestly don’t see any catalysts for significant revenue improvements in the coming years.One big reason is Amazon continues to invest heavily in its own shipping solutions, including essentially copying the models of FedEx and UPS (UPS) in some ways. Amazon has its own aircraft fleet, its own vans that do last-mile deliveries with Amazon employees, and a huge supply chain network supporting these solutions. Amazon has enormous cash it can use from its core retail and cloud businesses to invest basically however much it wants into more efficient – and cheaper – delivery solutions not only for its own products, but for others as well.This is a structural headwind for both FedEx and UPS because Amazon has shown time and again that when it wants to win in a segment, it will stop at nothing to do so. I think FedEx is going to have a very difficult time competing with Amazon over the long term for this reason.In addition to that, FedEx simply doesn’t have the cash to compete when it comes to investing for the future. Below, we have earnings before taxes, or EBT, in millions of dollars, and EBT as a percentage of revenue for the past three years, the current year, and next year’s estimate.Source: TIKR.comThe story here is that operating margins have been declining for years and there is simply no end in sight for these profitability issues. While we should see a rebound in fiscal 2021, one must keep in mind this rebound is from extremely low levels, and that profitability next year is expected to be down significantly from fiscal 2019 and prior years. Operating costs continue to rise, and while FedEx is doing what it can to cut inefficiencies and boost shipping prices, it just isn’t working. That’s not my opinion; that is a fact based upon years of data.All of this translates into very disappointing EPS numbers, as we can see below.Source: Seeking AlphaEPS is expected to be roughly congruent with fiscal 2015 this year, and not much better next year. The combination of stagnant revenue and margins is more than FedEx can overcome, and to be totally honest, while I’m not willing to say FedEx will never earn $15 per share again, I’m also not willing to rule it out.Apart from the problems I mentioned related to earnings, FedEx has cash generation issues that have led to significant debt. Below, we have free cash flow in millions of dollars for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2021, and it isn’t pretty.Source: TIKR.comFCF over time has been negative cumulatively, and given the enormous capex needs of FedEx, there is no reason that should change. The company spends every penny it generates from operating cash flows on capex and then some, resulting in the deficits you see above.This has ramifications for keeping up with Amazon because FedEx is currently tapped out in terms of what it can spend on network improvements. Amazon has no such limitation, so as time goes on, it is my belief that FedEx will fall further and further behind.This has more tangible, immediate implications as well, as it has caused the company’s debt load and cost to service that debt rise meaningfully over time.Source: TIKR.comNet debt has risen very steadily every year and it is because FedEx simply spends more cash than it generates. The deficit must come from somewhere, and that has been debt. Given all of the factors discussed above, I think we’ll continue to see FedEx add more and more debt over time as it tries to keep up with its competitors.This is not only an unfavorable outcome for the balance sheet, but the cost to service debt rises over time as well, as we can see with interest expense in millions of dollars below.Source: TIKR.comThis is a real cost for FedEx that comes out of earnings, and this year, it is expected to be something like $600 million. As FedEx continues to outspend its FCF generation and tries to stay competitive, this number will rise as well, likely making EPS growth even harder than it already was.Finally, despite all of these cash generation issues, FedEx insists on buying back large amounts of stock and paying an ever-growing dividend to shareholders.Source: TIKR.comI get why FedEx wants to do these things; they boost EPS via a lower float and provide shareholders with income, respectively. However, given the structural challenges the company faces and the fact that it is already outspending FCF generation, these things seem like poor uses of cash it doesn’t have in the first place. FedEx’s insistence to return capital to shareholders will, in my view, only make its cash situation worse over time, which is something it simply cannot afford.While FedEx has an impressive network of supply chain solutions, it is fighting a losing battle in a very competitive field. There is a place for FedEx long term, but the years of consistent EPS growth have come and gone, and I don’t see FedEx’s long-term goals as reasonable any longer.Shares are valued at 14.4X next year’s EPS estimate of $9.66, which is right near where FedEx has been valued in recent years. Therefore, the stock is fully valued already, meaning that any potential upside from multiple expansion has already been seen.With cash generation problems and a lack of growth catalysts, this fully-valued stock looks quite unattractive to me at this point. I think FedEx is a sell, and if you insist on owning a supply chain stock, you’re much better off with Amazon."
4356565,103219,2020-07-01T10:33:18-04:00,We made a bullish case for Fedex Corporation last October.Continued cash burn alongside deteriorating fundamentals has made things far less appealing.We are exiting this one and looking for other opportunities.,"When we last covered Fedex Corporation (FDX) we made a bullish case on the company based on three different valuation measures, which we felt helped make an investment case. We were particularly thrilled to buy the company at one of its lowest price to sales ratios in two decades. We showed this chart at the time and asked if investors would get a better opportunity. Source: When The Time Comes To Buy, You Won't Want To: FedEx EditionUnfortunately, while we were focusing on the company valuations, a pandemic was brewing in the background. Fedex stock broke down hard in the ""March Madness"". It has since rebounded and now is jumping higher on the results. What is an investor to do at this point?As Q4-2019 results were released, investors breathed a collective sigh of relief. The results appeared ""less bad"" on several fronts. First, revenues came in stronger than expectations for the quarter. The May 31, 2020 quarter had two months of full-blown shutdown across many parts of the globe and it was impressive to see just a small revenue decline. The company also delivered much stronger adjusted GAAP profit numbers for the quarter. Source: Fedex press releaseOn an annual basis, excluding goodwill impairment and pension liability changes, the company reported over $9.50 in earnings. Source: Fedex press releaseWe made the bull case the last time and it is not hard to see it again. If earnings are in a trough, then the stock is cheap. Wall Street usually has no problems drawing straight lines into infinity and this is one case where this is illustrated to perfection.Source: Seeking AlphaWhat is particularly telling here, though, is that analysts expect a very strong revenue rebound.Source: Seeking AlphaIf you accept the revenue story, it is not too hard to accept the earnings story. After all, Fedex delivered $15.52 in adjusted earnings on revenues of $69.4 billion in 2019, so $18.00 on $90.00 billion implies weak margins all the way forward. Fedex should also benefit from the move to increased online shopping. If COVID is here to stay for another year or so, the revenue story may have even more legs. If we are thus buying it at 16X 2021 earnings, with a growth story in front of us, how can we go wrong?The bear case has a few different components, but they are all captured adequately by the slide below. Source: Fedex 8-KEssentially bears point to the fact that revenues would have been far worse if Fedex Ground Segment had not picked up the slack dropped by Fedex Express Segment. This is correct. The Express segment is one that creates the most profits for Fedex and the drop in the last 12 months is very distressing. The second part of the story is that capital expenditures are just incredibly high yet to fall in love with the company. Fedex blew through almost $6.0 billion in capex last fiscal year and that was almost 5 times its annual income. Fedex still plans to spend almost $5.0 billion in 2021 and as we can see, its capex has continued to be rather impressive for a $36 billion market capitalization company. The earnings story is possibly there and Fedex certainly could generate $18.00 of earnings down the line as it assumes modest margins. But we are having increasing doubts whether earnings are actually telling us anything meaningful at this stage. The free cash flow or lack of thereof is a more concerning area for us. Certainly bulls can point to the fact that while capital expenditures are high, they are an offset to the high depreciation expense. But capital expenditures have continued to outstrip operating cash flow over the past four years and will likely do so in the next 12 months.Source: Seeking AlphaThere is also a downside to the revenues and margins as Fedex is competing against United Parcel Services Inc. (UPS) and Amazon (AMZN). Fedex has also limited its flexibility in this cycle by increasing debt at a rather brisk pace. Both S&P and Moody's have Fedex debt outlook as negative and we believe a rating cut is highly likely unless the company acts quickly. A rating cut would put it at the last rung of investment grade. A two tier cut into junk land would also not be out of the question as both rating agencies had put Fedex on negative watch prior to the pandemic. Fedex's operating cash flow will likely be under its capital expenditure guidelines for the year and net debt should increase by about $1 billion in the next 12 months thanks to $700 million in dividends. How will Fedex protect its credit rating and continue to fund its business? The obvious choice is a dividend elimination as it frees up $700 million of cash. We, however, think this will not help much as Fedex will still be free cash flow negative into 2022, even without paying dividends. The only way out here for the company is a massive equity issuance, possibly diluting share counts by 10-20%. That would create $6-$8 billion of debt reduction and allow maintaining the dividend. The recent rise in stock price is a rather perfect opportunity for the company to do so and we would watch for that as the analysts start gushing in upgrades. If Fedex loses its window though to issue equity, it certainly has a good chance of cutting its dividend. Based on all the information, Fedex has a ""High"" level of danger of a dividend cut on our proprietary Kenny Loggins Scale.This rating signifies a 33%-50% probability of dividend cut in the next 12 months.ConclusionFedex has continued to disappoint investors and we don't see a material free cash flow improvement over the next 24 months to warrant a buy rating. In fact, if Fedex loses this narrow window to issue equity at decent prices, there is likely a serious downside case to be made as it gets downgraded to junk status. At $163 and change, the stock is perhaps a tad overvalued for its prospects over the next 24 months.

4356508,33291,2020-07-01T04:18:13-04:00,"The COVID-19 disruption appears to have had a mixed impact on operations.
        Shares are still down over 100 points from highs seen in 2018, and are still lower year-to-date.
        Margins were better than expected leading to stronger than expected earnings in Q4.
        We see a manufacturing recovery in Asia and smaller businesses getting back to work benefiting the company along with the ongoing TNT Express integration.","Prepared by Tara, Senior Analyst at BAD BEAT InvestingWe have been mildly bullish on shipping names in recent weeks following the uptick in online shopping thanks to the stay at home trends produced by COVID-19. FedEx (FDX) is a primary play in this space. Shares are still down over 100 points from highs seen in 2018, and are still lower year-to-date. While the outlook remains unclear, we think it is a fine long-term play. FedEx has had a number of questionable quarters in recent years, and this has helped keep pressure on shares compared to where they were a few years ago. However, with the most recent quarter having just been reported, we suspect the next leg up for the stock is underway.Why? Well the company has just reported a solid set of results. Admittedly this was a tough quarter to handicap, and expectations were all over the place. While it was largely expected that sales would fall, the consensus expectations were met and exceeded handily. We believe this is bullish, and this the stock should rally well over $150 on the news. Just how good were the numbers?It was widely expected that sales would fall thanks to a tough March and April. Well, revenue was $17.4 billion, falling just 2.2% year-over-year and beating estimates by $880 million. These were of course down from $17.8 billion a year ago. That was a strong positive we thought. Performance was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. all revenue and expense line items were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during the quarter. While commercial volumes were down significantly due to business closures across the globe, there were surges in residential deliveries that really drove this better than expected number.On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were actually a loss of $1.28 for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to a loss of $7.56 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income was positive, coming in at 907 million, thought this was down from $1.72 billion last year. This result saw a benefit from operating margins of 5.2%, well above consensus in the mid 3% range. Adjusted earnings were $2.53 per share, crushing expectations by $0.97. A rally is warranted on these headlines. The growing divergence in segment performance was notable. Segment-specific results were very telling. We knew that commercial volumes would be down significantly due to business closures across the globe. But we also saw big increases in residential deliveries at FedEx Ground and in transpacific and charter flights at FedEx Express. Of course these have associated costs to serve customers.One source of ongoing costs has been the TNT Express integration. This is a multi-year process. We think that you can continue expect that FedEx will have a lot of expenses for the next two years as they continue the integration of TNT Express. It is expensive. Many of the adjusted metrics reported adjust for the significant TNT Express integration expenses. These adjustments are made as the expenses aren't part of so-called normal operations. They include professional and legal fees, salaries and employee benefits, travel and advertising expenses. It is expected that the company will continue to see big hits to GAAP results thanks to this. So it is something to keep in mind going forward.The COVID-19 disruption appears to have had a mixed impact on operations. We believe the stay at home trend will continue this year, and that will benefit the residential deliveries that have spiked. As global economies reopen, albeit slowly, we think the commercial side of things improve. We remain mildly bullish and think that so long as the overall market remains relatively strong, despite recession expectations, shares will continue to improve based on improving commercial deliveries. As we see a manufacturing recovery in Asia and smaller businesses getting back to work, we should see a surge in international air freight demand, and domestic commerce. Coupled with the ongoing TNT integration, we think the situation is less dire than many believe.

4334262,105526,2020-03-25T20:31:22-04:00,"FedEx's 3Q20 results beat highlighted the excessively low expectations on the stock.The 3Q20 call offered encouraging insight into a potential manufacturing recovery in Asia.Cost/efficiency drivers look set to cushion EPS, while the potential realization of TNT synergies adds to the upside potential.The market has de-rated FDX stock excessively, leaving plenty of room for an upside surprise.","Despite the potential for further reductions ahead, as well as the likely EPS pressure early in 4Q20, I think FedEx (FDX) could work as a potential supply chain recovery story. Shares have drawn down significantly over the year and now trade at ~11x FY21 EPS numbers. Given FedEx's potential to consistently compound at above-average ROICs through the cycles, as well as investors' pessimism on TNT, I see ample room for an upside surprise should the macro outlook stabilize/improve. With green shoots of a recovery emerging in Asia, coupled with the EPS benefit from successful cost actions and a successful TNT integration, I see ample room for an upside surprise.FDX's fiscal 3Q results were considerably weak on an absolute basis, though the excessively low expectations heading into the quarter led to a handy beat. Management also withdrew its full fiscal year outlook, which, while understandable, has likely clouded investors' ability to assess FDX's trough earnings power. However, there were some bright spots – for instance, management did broadly outline plans to keep costs in check amidst the uncertainties. Measures include the retiring of older aircraft by FY22, hiring restrictions, as well as delivering SmartPost and day-dedicated Express packages through the Ground network. On a positive note, management reiterated that the TNT integration remains on track, with an anticipated close by fall 2021.A closer look at the 3Q20 results within a historical context offers a sense of how weak the results were - consolidated operating margins at 2.8% (excluding TNT-related integration expenses) was the worst quarterly profit margin over the last decade, with FY20 margins now likely set for ~3-4%. Total company profits were also down by >50% YoY despite revenue rising relative to the prior year.Source: Company DataLooking ahead, revenues are underperforming December expectations (note this is prior to the outbreak), with the early Lunar New Year and other structural headwinds likely offsetting the benefit from the favorable timing of Cyber Monday, and strong results in FDX Freight.Meanwhile, the COVID-19 disruption appears to have been a mixed bag for FDX – though total cargo capacity to China dropped by 40%, FDX did maintain their service levels, helping to support higher load factors. Interestingly, China volumes have started to rebound in early March as most businesses return to work.While European activity has been weighed down by the outbreak, there is a clear opportunity to gain share – with the 60% of Europe-USA freight volume on passenger planes no longer flying (vs. 30% for US-China), FDX is well-positioned to step in to take advantage. The net impact will still likely be adverse as the demand trough is likely ahead of us, but expectations are already very low, and thus, I see ample room for an upside surprise.The Express segment's 3Q20 results were largely a write-off given the softer global backdrop, with EBIT declining ~55% YoY, and margins deteriorating by ~270bps YoY in Q3, with the company right-sizing capacity to offset the impact (capacity reduction target of 6%-8%). However, it is worth noting that a pickup in Asia has led to FDX flying more planes than expected.With the green shoots of a recovery on the horizon, a further manufacturing recovery in Asia should drive a surge in international air freight demand as businesses urgently look to replenish goods. Coupled with the TNT integration, the Express segment looks to be setting up favorably heading into FY21. Interoperability of the European Ground segment is expected to be finished by the end of FY20, and the pickup and delivery (P&D) and line-haul integration are set for completion in FY21. With duplicative costs set to be removed from the network, I expect to see significant improvements in the Express business' margin profile next year, with the improved earnings power likely to support a re-rating case.Ground results came in well below expectations in the quarter as cost overruns offset the steady top-line performance. Revenues of $5.9B were up 11% YoY, though operating profit of $355M declined by 39% YoY on increased operating expenses.Source: Form 10-QDelving deeper into the segment breakout, ~190 bps of cost headwinds to Ground were attributable to the 6/7 Day delivery and the Amazon (AMZN) loss, along with a $115 mm incentive comp headwind and 180 bps headwind from insurance. Management does, however, expect these headwinds to abate as we move through the calendar year.On a positive note, e-commerce continues to drive outsized volume growth, as ground volumes were up 10% YoY, with management guiding toward continued volume growth going forward.Source: Form 10-QAlso notable was the launch of the last-mile initiative, with Express volumes going through the Ground network for select Deferred packages. Thus far, this has been rolled out in Greensboro, NC, and will expand to Cincinnati, Phoenix, Minneapolis, New York, Salt Lake City in April. However, management has yet to offer additional color into the potential gains from the move, which makes it difficult to quantify the P&L impact at this juncture.I see the near-term FDX story as increasingly focused on its ability to drive cost savings – in particular, the planned reduction in FDX's air network capacity will be key, along with the move to shift a portion of the Express B2C volume to the Ground network. Ground should also benefit from the insourcing of Smart Post package delivery from the U.S. Postal Service. Though I would not be too quick to call a trough, I do expect sequential improvement in Ground margin in 4Q20, as a result, though visibility into FY21 remains limited. Additionally, FDX has reiterated its capex guidance of $5.9B for FY20, though the company has the ability to flex down capex if necessary. Looking ahead, capex should trend meaningfully lower in FY23 as aircraft deliveries wind down.I also see additional earnings upside should FDX execute on the initial synergies envisaged with the TNT integration (i.e., route optimization, interoperability, and labor efficiency).Source: Roadshow PresentationWith the market largely de-rating the stock following the EBIT improvement target delay, I think considerable pessimism has already been priced into TNT synergy expectations. I would argue that integration benefits are, instead, likely to be back-ended given major EU countries (such as France and Germany) will be integrated at the end. At this point, I think if management is able to capture even a portion of the $750 Mn EBIT benefit, we could see the stock re-rate in FY21 as the market re-evaluates FDX's pro-forma earnings power.With FDX trading at ~11x earnings on my base case FY21 EPS estimate of ~$10.50/share, I see the medium-term upside potential for FDX as significantly greater than the downside risk. The current multiple is significantly below where FDX has generally traded through prior cycles, with a continually improving ROIC as the Ground segment becomes a larger part of the business, as well as synergy and efficiency benefits likely to cushion EPS in the upcoming quarters. Thus, I would argue FDX deserves a much higher premium to the market than it currently receives.Data by YChartsWhile there is a clear valuation case to be made, the market may not re-rate the stock until we gain better visibility into the potential ripple effects of the coronavirus across Europe and the US. Patient, longer-term investors may, however, find the stock worth a nibble."
4333428,25120,2020-03-21T19:27:10-04:00,"FedEx posted third quarter results which really are not that interesting given the current crisis.Encouraging is that FedEx will benefit with some businesses from the crisis, although the total impact will likely be negative.While FedEx has real issues and leverage ratios warrant caution, shares might offer a great long-term buy here.","FedEx (FDX) reported results which brought some comfort to investors during a week in which markets were still in turmoil. While shares are down a third from the high of $165 in February at $110, and have lost more than half their value from the highs in 2018, shares have seen a rebound from an intra-week low around $90.Shares performed relatively well over the past week as investors recognize that the company will see headwinds, yet the actual turmoil caused by the Coronavirus makes that the company might be a beneficiary of this to a smaller extent as well. After all, traditional just-in-time supply chains have come to a standstill making (additional) transportation required, notably for the international express unit. Furthermore, the company might benefit from social distancing and thus more e-commerce orders as well, as this pandemic might actually accelerate e-commerce sales.Nonetheless, investors should brace themselves for negative surprises as the company is suspending the 2020 earnings forecast and is focusing heavily on cost-cutting opportunities.FedEx reported third quarter results which ended the quarter on the final day of February. The only bright news is that sales were up 3% to $17.5 billion. Growth has been driven by the Ground segment with most other segments posting relatively flattish sales results.Margins did take a beating as reported operating earnings fell exactly by half a billion to $411 million. The reason for the depressed earnings is that costs were up quite a bit. Salaries, purchases transportation, rentals and depreciation expense each rose between 5-10% year-over-year. This made that margins fell to just 2.3% of sales.With net earnings of $315 million, reported earnings per share fell from $2.80 per share to $1.20 per share. Even if we exclude TNT integration costs, adjusted earnings fell from $3.03 to $1.41 per share.For the first nine months of the year, GAAP earnings fell from $9.41 per share to $6.17 per share, as the current performance is arguably not indicative for the potential of the business. More important is the strength of the balance sheet heading into these challenging times. The company holds about $1.8 billion in cash, offset by $19.3 billion in debt, resulting in a $17.5 billion net debt load, which kindly excludes billions in post-retirement liabilities as well. That causes some potential overhang, although it all depends on the extent and deepness of the downturn.In June 2019, FedEx reported its fiscal year results for 2019, with the earnings numbers being a bit complicated as well. Adjusted earnings came in at $15.52 per share, with GAAP earnings only totaling $2.03 per share. The vast majority of the huge discrepancy results from retirement plans accounting adjustments, as well as TNT integration expenses, and some other expenses. The company generated nearly $70 billion in sales that year on which it reported adjusted operating profits of $5.2 billion and EBITDA of around $7 billion.Problematic is that EBITDA will fall quite a bit this year, making that leverage ratios increase quite a bit, as cash flow conversion is an issue given that this is a capital-intensive business, with the company investing more than depreciation expenses currently come in at. That being said, in this environment the company might easily defer or suspend some capital investments to preserve cash flows. While transportation is a cyclical business, truth is that FedEx is somewhat insulated thanks to more shipments going through its e-commerce network and international freight network. This might provide some relief and allow the company to withstand the pressure on the balance sheet, although it could become challenging times.In the summer of 2018 I last looked at FedEx, which reported solid growth at the time. Fast forwarding nearly two years in time, net debt has increased about $4 billion over the past two years, while EBITDA metrics already have come under pressure amidst slower worldwide economic growth, challenges with the TNT integration and the significant pension issues.Shares traded around $240 at the time as FedEx was doing very well. Amidst the slowdown in economic growth and some self-inflicted issues, margins and shares have taken a beating, thereby pushing up leverage ratios a bit. This is a concern with the coronavirus crisis now arriving.Based on the leverage employed and large underfunded pension liabilities, I never think that FedEx should trade at a market multiple. In good times the company could earn $15-$20 per share and good times might return after the current events are over, as such potential future achievements might justify a $250-$300 per share valuation once the economy is back on its feet. For now the question is if FedEx can weather the storm unharmed. That's without incurring dilution or other risks or expenses to shareholders.Nonetheless, the good thing about FedEx despite the long-term potential is that some parts of the business might do well in these circumstances. Hence, I see appeal here around the $100 mark as a true long term investment based on the potential for shares to trade at much higher levels in the future."

That expansion could hurt margins again this quarter.If management gives a weak outlook, then it could drag down FDX and the entire transportation sector. Sell FDX.","Source: Barron'sFedEx (FDX) reports earnings Tuesday. Analysts expect revenue of $16.94 billion and EPS of $1.48. The revenue estimate implies flat growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.The U.S. economy cannot grow in perpetuity and economic forces are weaker than once thought. The impact of the coronavirus and low oil prices could expose that weakness. Airlines and restaurants have experienced reduced activity as countries around the world attempt to contain the coronavirus. The coronavirus has hurt global supply chains. As a result, global trade has faltered.FedEx management previously lamented about the collapse of global trade due to the trade war with China. The decline in global trade could hurt the company's top line growth by the second half of the year. Secondly, businesses could delay spending due to uncertainty about the future, pressuring on the company's top line growth.Last quarter, FedEx generated $17.8 billion, down 3% Y/Y. FedEx Express revenue fell 5% Y/Y due to the loss of a large customer and macroeconomic headwinds. Amazon (AMZN) is no longer banning Marketplace sellers from using FedEx shipping, so FedEx could see an increase in volume this quarter. Revenue from FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight both rose in the low-single-digit percentage range. If business activity declines going forward, then it could reduce the need to send sensitive documents via FedEx. If businesses cut back on spending, then demand for FedEx's premium services could face headwinds. Given thawing trade tensions with China, the company could post solid results, but is it sustainable?FedEx's revenue decline was accompanied by rising costs. The company's cost structure is built for growth. When that growth does not materialize, the fall out could be declining margins. Competition from Amazon and UPS (UPS) may have exacerbated the situation, as margins fell hard. Operating income was $554 million, down over 50% Y/Y. Operating income margin was 3.3%, down about 370 basis points versus the year earlier period.On a segment basis, operating income at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground fell 63% and 42%, respectively. Management is expanding FedEx Ground to six- and seven-day delivery. FedEx is spending money on the expanded service, but will the additional revenue justify the build out? It is difficult to second-guess management. However, FedEx is expanding its services just as the economy may have peaked.A 3% decline in revenue and 1% rise in costs was bound to crimp margins. The company's two largest costs were salaries (36% of revenue) and purchased transportation (24% of revenue). Management was adamant the economy was strong enough that it did not have to resort to layoffs. However, industrial companies like General Electric (GE) and several railroads have laid people off as their top lines have eroded. It will be interesting to see if management changes its posture on layoffs given the current weak economic outlook.A recession appears in play. FedEx could show some improvement this quarter, but I expect falling economic activity to hurt by the second half of the year. That does not bode well for FedEx or the transportation sector.The company could post solid results, given thawing trade tensions with China, but is it sustainable? Transportation services is considered a vital sign of the economy. FedEx's shipping services are often seen as a harbinger for the state of the U.S. economy. Goldman Sachs (GS) sees GDP shrinking by 5% in Q2 due to effects of the coronavirus. I believe them. FedEx could be a bellwether for the economy. Management has a penchant for being brutally honest, even if that honesty is not consistent with rhetoric from the policymakers or the media. If FedEx gives a weak outlook for its earnings or the economy, then it could cause the transportation sector or broader markets to turn down. All eyes will likely be on FDX this afternoon.FDX is off over 40% Y/Y. A weak outlook on revenue or margins could cause the stock to fall further. Sell FDX."

Based on my estimates, this could drive 300-500 bps in margin.This can double the company’s stock; a multiple re-rate provides even further upside.","FedEx (FDX) is a well-known name and the company has been written about extensively in the financial press, so I won’t dwell too much on the company’s description. The thesis is simple:Due to its “operate independently” mantra, FedEx has a bloated and underutilized domestic Express network. Recent actions suggest that FedEx is in the early innings of integrating this network with its robust Ground infrastructure. Based on my estimates, this could drive 300-500 bps in margin improvement, equivalent to >$4bn in annual savings. This can double the company’s stock; a multiple re-rate provides even further upside.By way of introduction, FedEx operates three segments: FedEx Express ($40bn revenues, 5.5% operating margin), FedEx Ground ($21bn in revenues, 13% operating margin) and FedEx Freight ($8bn in revenue, 8% operating margin). FedEx Express deals with domestic and international “Express”, or time-definite shipping, FedEx Ground deals with domestic/Canadian “day-definite” shipping and Freight is the largest less-than-truckload (NYSEARCA:LTL) freight services provider in the U.S.To answer this question, we must travel back to 1998 when FedEx purchased Caliber Systems. Prior to the acquisition, Federal “Express” was pure-play in the fast-growing United States Express business. Caliber Systems represented its entry into the FedEx Ground and Freight businesses. UPS (UPS), on the other hand, grew its Ground and Freight businesses separately, and this is a key difference between the two companies. Whereas FedEx elected to keep its two networks separate, UPS chased economies of scale by integrating its operations into one “UPS Domestic” segment. Practically, this means that if you send two packages to an address to be delivered on the same day - one through Express and one through Ground - two FedEx trucks will arrive at the recipient’s address on delivery day (albeit two half-full trucks).Given the scale advantages inherent in the logistics industry that I need not spend time mulling over, why didn’t FedEx integrate? Surely, it wasn’t incompetent leadership: Frederick Smith is well-revered and was CEO of the year in 2004. Perhaps the nature of the two operations are different: FedEx executives will tell you that the time-sensitive nature of Express packages requires a dedicated, separate network to service (Source: Author’s calls). However, this doesn’t explain how UPS is able to offer a similar quality service with integrated networks. Nor does it explain the fact that FedEx integrated its European Express operations with TNT Express, a recent acquisition that has an extensive Ground network in continental Europe. If it can be done in Europe, why not in the U.S.?This leaves culture and union concerns. Smith’s disposition is very geared towards Express, and actually wrote a college term paper on Express shipping. On the other hand, he was a pilot during the Vietnam War, earning a Silver Star for his service. Former executives also indicate that the Express and “Ground guys” usually don’t mix (Source: author’s calls). In addition, the industry was still scarred from a huge Union strike at UPS. For reasons I will discuss shortly, having separate networks mitigates the power of Unions.Valid reasoning in 1998, but I argue it isn’t valid today. For one, UPS hasn’t experienced a significant strike since the 1997 Teamsters strike. In addition, the number of work stoppages has decreased dramatically since the 1980’s (187 in 1980 vs. 11 in 2010). Moreover, FedEx Freight has certain unionized locations, but it hasn’t experienced any debilitating strikes over the past decade.This financial ramifications of having two separate networks, however, are severe. Despite enjoying financial advantages of having a non-union workforce, FedEx throws away this advantage and some in the form of a bloated infrastructure:(Source: Company filings)This has been the case since the early 2000s, and along with it a ~3-turn valuation difference with UPS. The long-term effects are even more mind-boggling: UPS generated more FCF in 2018 than FDX has cumulatively generated over the last 12 years.From an operational point-of-view, this financial under-performance stems from a severe efficiency differential to UPS on virtually every operational metric:(Source: Company Filings, Air Traffic Statistics, Author's Estimates)FedEx enjoys a 2.1% EBITDAR advantage due to having a non-unionized workforce (Source: author’s calculations). However, this is more-than-offset by a 4.7% margin disadvantage due to a bloated asset-base (Source: author’s calculations).Unions can potentially come into play when you combine Express and Ground segments, and my conversations with industry executives indicate that this is the prime reason Smith has opposed a full-scale integration. According to the IRS:Specifically, the “degree of control” matters:Over the past several years, pockets of Ground drivers across the country have been pursuing litigation against FedEx arguing this very reason: FedEx exerts significant control over their work, and they should therefore be classified as employees. FedEx has prevailed in these litigations thus far. However, if the Ground and Express networks were combined, drivers who previously had some leeway in determining their work schedule for Ground shipments must now handle Express shipments that need to be delivered by a certain time. If there’s an 8am delivery in that truck, then the driver needs to get up in the morning even if every other package is a Ground package that can be delivered at any point in the day. Given this, a stronger legal argument can be made that FedEx will be exerting “significant influence” and a much higher “degree of control” over the IC’s work schedules, and FedEx might have to yield and classify IC’s as employees.A similar situation exists for Express workers. Due to the nature of time-sensitive shipments, work stoppages and strikes can yield havoc for Express businesses. This was a big deal in the early 1900’s in the case of railroads, leading the government to enact the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (RLA). This law essentially laid out a set process for employees to work out grievances with the parent company; in other words, it make it more difficult for employees to stop the operations of an Express business, go on strike or otherwise disrupt the daily package flow of an Express carrier. The key here is that this classification only applied to employees of railroads and other “Express carriers”:Currently, FedEx Express is designated as an Express carrier under the RLA. However, if the company were to merge its Ground and Express networks, it may lose this classification, giving employees free reign to strike or join a national union (as is with the case of UPS).I’ve illustrated that union woes don’t justify a ~500 bps margin drag, but can FedEx potentially side-step this? Operationally, perhaps the best workaround for the union situation would be the way FedEx assigns workers to certain deliveries. Express AM deliveries (time-sensitive morning deliveries) are the most time-sensitive, Express PM can be delivered in the afternoon and Ground deliveries are the least time-sensitive. Therefore, FedEx can assign current Express/Ground employees to Express AM deliveries while assigning Express PM/Ground deliveries to employees and independent contractors. This may preserve the RLA status for Express employees without exerting “significant control” over independent contractors.FedEx has an opportunity to increase margins by over 400 bps by integrating its domestic Express and Ground operations. We can estimate this by using UPS as a proxy.If you were to combine FedEx’s domestic Express and Ground businesses, you essentially have a U.S. delivery business with the following characteristics: about 90,000 drivers and 1,300 facilities handing ~12m daily packages. The comparable UPS domestic company has about 75,000 drivers and 1,000 facilities handling ~17.5m daily packages. On a per driver basis, therefore, FedEx handles about 133 packages and UPS handles 233 packages; on a per facility basis, FedEx handles 9,231 packages and UPS handles 17,500 packages. If we can close each of these gaps by 50%, this would imply eliminating 90k-12m/183=24,000 drivers and 1,300-12m/13,366=400 facilities. We know drivers cost $40k/driver/year for FedEx, so the savings from the 24k reduction would be on the order of $960m. Facilities can cost anywhere from $5m-10m/year depending on the side, and this would give us potential savings of $2-4bn. Finally, FedEx currently spends double per air package relative to UPS, and airlines are highly underutilized, evidenced by a 450bps differential between payload factor vs. UPS (Source: Air Traffic Statistics). By reducing domestic airline capacity, FedEx can realize ~$800m in incremental savings (40% of gap to UPS closed).This corroborates nicely with our margin picture: taking the low end of ~$4bn in total savings is about 5.7%, which would bump FedEx’s margin from 7.5% to 13.2% vs. UPS’s margin of ~10%. These estimates corroborate with my industry calls. In addition, industry experts agree that logistically, this isn’t an extremely difficult result to accomplish.Up until now, this was a theoretical possibility. In addition, Smith seems to have a personal vendetta against an integration. According to Q4 2019 Earnings call:However, this all changed last week: FedEx Express will now begin contracting with FedEx Ground to deliver residential packages. The driving force of this change, Raj Subramaniam, came onto the board of directors about a month ago. Executive turnover over the last year within FedEx’s C-suite also indicates a change in mood and potentially a slate of people ready to look at the business radically. A combination of these factors makes realizing a portion of these potential cost savings a real possibility.FedEx is a sleeping giant- while this opportunity has existed for over a decade and has in fact intensified in recent years as the company has invested heavily in its duplicative Express infrastructure. There is precedent for an integration strategy working, however. Back in 2013, Third Point got involved in the company championing some of these same issues I’ve raised in this article, but exited by way of greenmail.Using the low range of our estimates, FedEx can achieve ~$4bn in incremental pre-tax savings through a full integration of FedEx Ground and Express. These numbers are based on only 20-40% reduction in the “efficiency gap” between the domestic Express and Ground networks. Interestingly, international Express is doing fine with margins far greater than that of domestic Express (Source: Author’s estimates based on conversations with industry experts).On top of this, FedEx has historically traded at a ~6-7x EBITDA multiple, relative to UPS’s ~10-11x multiple. This is most likely a result of FedEx’s lower cash conversion, higher capex requirements and lower margins (despite it having a superior Ground business that is non-unionized). An integration will directly improve on all these metrics and we can expect to see a multiple re-rate along the lines of UPS given the success of this strategy.Its important not to overstate the what is happening, however. Specifically, FedEx has publicly stated that this change isn’t a full integration; rather, it is structured as a contract between the two segments and will only deal with residential deliveries. However, this does signal a shift in management’s view on the business and indicates that we are in the early innings of a thorough internal review of the company’s asset efficiency. Previously, no internal studies had been conducted in FedEx to explore the potential monetary savings of an integration strategy (Source: Author’s calls with industry experts). Here is the potential savings we are looking at with such a strategy:(Source: Company filings, Author's Estimates)Others have argued that value can be recognized in several other ways- specifically a spinoff of FedEx Ground. While this is a good idea in theory, it is logistically difficult given the overlap in customers between the two businesses. In addition, it would be difficult to justify the valuation of FedEx Express as a standalone entity, which is chronically FCF negative given its current footprint and package volume. FedEx realizes this and therefore they haven’t divested/spun-off any business in the past several decades, another testament to the importance of scale in this industry.There are other pertinent issues that are relevant to FedEx, namely:These issues, while important, will undoubtedly make this article unbearably long. I mention them in passing to give a sense of some of the peripheral issues one should consider when deciding to invest in FedEx.As Smith says, the economy has a say and the competitors have a say. The recent developments between Express and Ground seem to indicate we are in the early innings of a managerial review of the company's disparate operations, and perhaps a step towards integration. While one should follow these developments closely and how they evolve, one also needs to look no further than UPS to determine how FedEx can look/operate with a more integrated business. I would also recommend getting familiar with BTS data to get operational information and indications of improvement at Express (both domestic and international).Even a portion of the savings I outlined here (>$4bn on the table) along with a multiple re-rate for the stock can allow investors to realize significant upside from investing in FedEx. All in all, there is a clear path to $300/share if this optimization continues."
4314790,95006,2020-01-01T06:09:15-05:00,"I warned investors about a FedEx price decline in March 2018.After the decline, I bought FedEx near the 2018 December lows based on historical cyclical price patterns.What has happened with FedEx in 2019 doesn't appear to me to a normal cycle, and I'll be a seller going into the new year.","(Source: Pixabay)For the past several years, I have focused most of my analysis on stock cycles. I first wrote about FedEx (FDX) in a March 15, 2018, article titled ""How Far Could FedEx Fall?"" In that article, I warned investors about how cyclical FedEx's stock price could be, and that even though it only appeared slightly overvalued at the time given analysts' high expectations, rotating out of FedEx and into Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) would be a wise move. I ended up eventually buying FedEx stock on December 20th, 2018, the same day my article ""Here's The Price I'll Start Buying FedEx"" was published. Here is how the stock fared in between those articles compared to Berkshire, my suggested alternative:Data by YChartsAn investor would have been spared from about a -30% drawdown by rotating out of FedEx and into Berkshire when my first article was published.My thesis when I bought FedEx last December was that the stock had been subject to big downcycles before, and I thought that I was buying it near a cyclical low and also at a deep enough discount to have a margin of safety in case the cycle was deeper than I expected.In my original FedEx article, I shared this historical price data and analysis:At the time that I bought FedEx on 12/20/18, the price was well off its highs:Data by YChartsThat was comparable to the 1997, 1999, and 2015 drawdowns. As long as the economy didn't slip into recession and FedEx went through a normal cycle, it seemed like a reasonably good bet to make. In my second FedEx article, I backtested the results of the strategy.It should be noted that in the two years the strategy wouldn't have been alpha-producing, it was still a profitable one.Here is how my FedEx purchase has performed versus the S&P 500 since I bought it on 12/20/18.Data by YChartsIn early 2019, FedEx behaved exactly how I expected it to, and even looked like it might start beating the market. Then, it all fell apart.The shaded green area in the F.A.S.T. Graph above shows FedEx's adjusted earnings over the past 20 years. The past two years saw a 1% gain and a -30% decline. Analysts had expected 16% annual gains for this period when I first looked at FedEx back in 2018. That's a big miss, which is something we might expect during a recessionary downcycle. In fact, the current decline looks awfully familiar to the Great Recession. The only problem, of course, is that we aren't in a recession. And while China's growth has slowed in the past couple of years (not helped by US tariffs) and there hasn't been much global growth, it's not enough to justify FedEx's earnings that we have seen this year. Frankly, they have been a disaster.Some have been quick to point the finger at Amazon (AMZN) as the culprit, and I think that has certainly played a part. While FedEx bulls are quick to point out that Amazon only represented a small portion of FedEx's business, I think they may be missing something. When someone orders something from Amazon Prime (which I seem to do almost every other day, it seems), some of that is business that could have gone to FedEx if I had ordered from somewhere else on the internet and had it delivered via FedEx. Toss in the trend of in-store pick-up that many retailers are doing now, and that is even more business FedEx potentially misses out on (even if it's not business the company once had and lost). Before in-store pick-up and Amazon, if I wanted anything faster and more reliable than US Mail, I basically had to use FedEx or UPS. Now, I have two more very appealing options. I can simply order from Amazon or order at any number of retailers and pick it up at a store near my house free of charge. That ""free of charge"" part is an important incentive for consumers. Prime is basically free if you are already a member, and in-store pick-up is simply a matter of someone's time, which many tend to value less than money, which is what they will have to pay FedEx for.I'm very aware that FedEx is mostly a B2B business, but I'm not sure how much growth is really going to come from there going forward - business-to-consumer seems threatened to me. That doesn't mean FedEx is doomed, but the problem is the company has a lot of leverage and is continuing to borrow.Data by YChartsGoing into the 2008 recession, FedEx had $2 billion in debt. Now it has 9x that amount. That's not going to augur well for the company when we have our next recession, which could be sooner rather than later. This is something I should have noticed last December but didn't, and that was a mistake on my part.Typically, I have four different types of articles that I write for cyclical stocks, and they generally have the same style of title so that I can keep track of them. When I think a cyclical stock is near its peak, I write a ""How far could they fall?"" article where I warn investors about the dangers of the stock and suggest alternative investments that won't fall as much. Then, when a stock falls about -20% off its highs, I write a ""Here's the price I'll start buying"" article. These share two entry points for the stock that would have been good to buy historically, and I backtest those entry points. Typically, a stock still has further to fall before it hits those entry points. The third type of article are ""buy"" articles, where I announce that I have purchased a stock. In these articles, I run the business through a series of what I call ""impairment tests"". These are a list of things that I look for that might be different this time than previous cycles which might impair a recovery. If a stock passes the impairment tests, I buy it at this point, and if it doesn't, I share why I'm passing on the stock (I did that with 3M (MMM) last year). And lastly, I write an article when I sell the stock - like this article - which reviews the results of my investment or trade so others can potentially learn from my victory (like my recent Micron (MU) article) or my mistakes.FedEx ended up being a little different than most stocks, and it caused me to cut corners regarding my impairment tests. What happened was, in the two days from which I submitted my ""Here's the price I'll start buying FedEx"" article to the time it was actually published, the stock price fell so much that it hit my buy price. If you will recall, this time in late December 2018 the market was falling rapidly. I was writing articles every single day either telling investors they could now rotate back into stocks I had suggested they rotate out of, or I was writing ""buy"" articles. In fact, I bought more than I could write about at the time. I bought Roper Technologies (ROP), Equifax (EFX) and more Apple (AAPL) on top of everything else I was buying, and I never even had time to write articles on those. So, it was a frantic time of buying, and I bought FedEx quickly and noted it in comment section of my 12/20/18 article (I didn't want to write a new article the very next day after I had just written one), but the mistake I made is that I didn't fully run the stock through my impairment tests.One of those tests is to check debt-to-equity this cycle compared to previous cycles.Data by YChartsIf I would have done that, I probably would have passed on the stock. The debt-to-equity, even back in December 2018 when the chart above ends, was double to quadruple what it had been during previous cycles. This is something I should have noticed but didn't in my haste to buy at a cheap price.It's important to stress here that I am the type of investor who tends to sell when others are buying and buy when others are selling. FedEx is an example of that. When the price was just off its all-time highs, I was bearish on the stock. And when the price fell dramatically last December, I did not hesitate to buy it. Now, when one looks that the sentiment of Seeking Alpha writers on FedEx, it is mostly bearish. It's rare that I join them, and I could very well be wrong. FedEx might have a plan here, and maybe China tariffs and a global economic slowdown were enough of a one-two punch to temporarily dent the company's business, Amazon is no threat, and FedEx will soon recover. However, I didn't buy FedEx stock as a turnaround play at this time last year. I bought it as part of a normal cyclical downturn and expected recovery. This doesn't seem like a normal cycle to me, and the difference in debt load this cycle compared to the last recession is enough to make me not want to hold the stock through the next downcycle. FedEx might end up being okay, but my thesis is broken in the sense that this cycle is simply not similar enough to previous cycles. We have both disruption going on and higher debt.I am fortunate that I bought with a good margin of safety. In fact, in the comment section of my original March 2018 article, I stated that I wouldn't likely buy FedEx stock until it was around $160-165, from just glancing at the numbers. At the time, the stock was trading at $247, and $160-165 turned out to be a reasonable price to place a bet on the stock. Because I was willing to wait for a margin of safety, I won't be losing much on this bet even though I made a mistake. Hopefully, this serves as a reasonable example of why a margin of safety is important.While I'm currently long FDX, I plan to sell my shares just after the new year. This doesn't appear to be a normal cycle from what I can see here. It might end up being a temporary decline, but it doesn't feel that way to me. It looks like a value trap to me, especially if we have a recession within the next two years, in which case, FedEx will have even more headwinds to deal with. If that happens, there could be tremendous downside for shareholders that they might not recover from for many years."
4331534,20715,2020-03-12T14:24:37-04:00,FedEx has been falling for over two years now and is down over 60%.The company is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday with analysts expecting a pretty sharp drop on a year-over-year basis.The stock has broken through several key support levels in the last few weeks.,"Global express freight company FedEx (FDX) is set to report earnings on Tuesday, but investors may be more concerned about the stock breaking below support ahead of that earnings report.I wrote about FedEx back in December ahead of the previous earnings report. I expressed at the time that I was neutral on the stock for a number of reasons, but one of the main reasons was the technical picture. The stock had been trending lower and I saw the possibility of the stock trading in a range between $140 and $175. The diagonal dashed line is from the original chart that I drew in December as is the solid line at the $140 level. I added the dashed line at $175 for this evaluation.I also expressed that I thought the $140 level was a low-risk entry point if a trader wanted to trade the range, but I cautioned that a break of $140 could see the stock fall all the way down to the $115 level which was the low in late 2015. As we can see on the weekly chart above and the monthly chart below, the stock has broken below $115.It’s also worth noting how oversold FedEx is at this time. The 10-month RSI is in oversold territory for the first time since 2009 and the monthly stochastic readings are the lowest they have been since that same bear market.When I first started writing this article, I took note of how the $107-$110 range acted as resistance back in 2006 and 2007 and thought it could act as support now, but by the time I could finish the article, the stock blew through that potential support as well.From a technical perspective, I personally would have a hard time buying FedEx right now. Perhaps if the stochastic readings make a bullish crossover and I see some support level hold, I might be willing to invest a small amount in the stock. But the allocation would be lower than my usual amount.This is actually the fourth time I have written about FedEx for Seeking Alpha with the first time being one year ago. In all three previous articles, I have taken a neutral stance and since that first article, the stock is down almost 38%. In each of the previous articles, I have expressed concern about the earnings falling and the trend of the stock.The earnings set for release next week are the fiscal Q3 2020 results and they are expected to show earnings per share of $1.67 and that is down from $3.03 for Q3 2019. That is a 44.9% drop in earnings compared to the same period from a year earlier. EPS dropped 38% in the second quarter and are expected to drop by 30% for 2020 as a whole. That is not a recipe for a stock that I want to own.Revenue is expected to come in at $17.05 billion and that is up from an even $17 billion in the third quarter of last year. Revenue has followed a pattern over the last four quarters with it down one quarter and then up the next. Revenue was down 3% in the second quarter so analysts expect that pattern to continue.I usually use Investor’s Business Daily for the management efficiency measurements, but those figures for FedEx seem to be inflated. The Wall Street Journal shows FedEx with a return on equity of 2.9% and a profit margin of 0.77%. Both of those figures are well below average.The fundamental issues with FedEx have been attributed to the trade war and the loss of business from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The two companies had a business disagreement and Amazon no longer uses FedEx for shipping products. The first phase of the trade agreement has been signed and maybe that will help FedEx down the road, but the ink on that agreement hadn’t even dried when the coronavirus outbreak hit China. Now, the virus has been labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization and it continues to spread across the globe.Part of me wonders if FedEx could somehow see a boost in revenue from the virus concerns. Is it possible that businesses will boost their overnight deliveries since so many are canceling business travel? Perhaps they conduct meetings over Skype and then send contracts overnight rather than meeting face to face and signing the documents in person. What about online shopping that isn’t done on Amazon? Could FedEx see a boost in business from customers looking for items not available at the local store and they need overnight or in only a few days?I don’t know the answer to these questions at this time. The economy seems to be on the verge of a contraction and even the possible upticks in the business mentioned above might not be enough to help boost FedEx’s revenue and earnings in the near future.The sentiment for FedEx has shifted considerably since last March. At this time, there are 27 analysts covering the stock with 14 “buy” ratings and 13 “hold” ratings. A year ago, there were 28 analysts covering the stock with 24 “buy” ratings and four “hold” ratings. If we look at it in terms of a percentage, last year the buy percentage was at 85.7% and now it’s at 51.9%. This marks a huge shift from extreme bullish sentiment to a stance that is below average.The short interest ratio is at 1.8 at this time and that is below average. This suggests that short-sellers are shying away from the stock. What is more concerning is that the short interest ratio was at 2.23 one year ago and it has been lower than the average stock for the past year. The stock has fallen over 58% from its peak in January ’18 and yet the short interest ratio hasn’t been over 2.5 for the last year.The put/call ratio is at 0.88 and that is slightly below average. There are 67,396 puts open at this time and 76,463 calls open. The ratio was slightly above average at 1.15 in December and it was at 1.05 last March.The overall look at sentiment indicates that analysts have become more skeptical toward FedEx while short sellers and option traders have become slightly more bullish. I’m a little surprised by these changes, but it could be a case where the stock has fallen so much in the last few years that bearish investors are afraid to step in at this point.I remain neutral on FedEx. The falling earnings and the low ROE and profit margin are discouraging from a fundamental standpoint. Sure, the trailing P/E being under 10 might seem attractive, but if earnings continue to fall, the P/E may jump even if the price continues to fall - it depends on which one falls faster. The company does pay a dividend and the yield is at 2.34% currently, but as we have seen from some of the energy companies recently, dividend cuts are always a possibility.The technical picture for FedEx is frightening in my opinion. Buying the stock at this point is a classic case of trying to catch a falling knife. Do I think the stock is going to zero? No, but it can still go significantly lower. I’m sure the people that bought the stock at $160 after it had hit $260 thought they were getting in at a great price and now it is just above $100. For anyone that bought the stock at $160 and is still holding the stock, they now need the stock to rally by almost 60% for them to get back to break-even.The sentiment toward FedEx is baffling to me. I find it hard to believe that the stock can fall from $260 to $110 with analysts’ ratings shifting from overly optimistic to slightly below average. I can’t believe the short interest ratio hasn’t jumped at all in the past year and has in fact gone down.I will continue to shy away from FedEx until two things happen. First, the earnings need to stabilize and start growing again before I will consider buying the stock. Secondly, the stock price needs to stabilize and start turning higher before I will consider buying the stock. I am more than willing to miss the bottom in order to see some movement to the upside from the stock and for earnings to stop shrinking quarter after quarter."
4321612,105093,2020-02-05T11:51:20-05:00,"FedEx faced fundamental challenges and hurdles for the most part of 2019.The company nonetheless remains an inherently profitable enterprise with, as i see it, extreme long-term appeal regardless of how a few comparatively minor items turn out.The time to buy FedEx is when the company is cheap - historically and valuation-wise. That time is slowly coming up again.","Being a long-term FedEx (FDX) shareholder has lost some of its shine over the past year. With the stock dropping from high, premium multiples to below a fair value multiple, we're currently looking at one of the world's primary logistics companies trading below a 15X forward earnings multiple.Unsurprisingly, this causes interest from value investors - myself included. I come down on the side where the company is buyable at the correct valuation, and I believe that time could be now or may be coming soon.Let's take a new look at FedEx to see where we are.So, for 2019 we've clearly seen that sentiment regarding FedEx has been overwhelmingly negative. This negative sentiment has come from, I would argue, two factors above any other.First, Amazon (AMZN) apprehension. While this is a point, I'm surprised at the degree of reaction we're seeing. Like I wrote in my last article on the logistics/shipping giant, "" Why FedEx Should Be Considered A Buy At Today's Valuation "", Amazon business represents less than 2% of FedEx revenue. It's also been shown that Amazon as a business, isn't a desirable customer to have for companies like FedEx due to their profit margins, with operating margins below 0.25%, with the quote of ""somewhere between tiny and zero"". (Source)(Source: 2020 Presentation)It's as though the street is seeing Amazon as a competitor to FedEx - which I do not consider to be the case. Amazon competes with other retail operations, not with logistical companies to whom they never offered an appealing profit in the first place. The fear here seems to be focused on the potential of Amazon becoming an actual logistics giant themselves, entering a space in order to try and bring a pricing war, much like they've done in other areas.These fears are not only irrational, but they're also - at least in the current market state - provably flawed, with all carriers increasing rather than dropping rates. This includes Amazon's own shipping/service prices (Source: Manufacturing.net). As we can see on the above graphics, FedEx is also increasing rates.(Source: Wikipedia)This isn't an article on Amazon, but I'd like to reiterate a caution I've made on Amazon before, at least insofar as the European market. While I personally love Amazon as a service and hub to make many of my own purchases, I see their continued existence in current form in many markets (and certain segments) as balancing on the tip of a spear.Germany, which is currently the company's second-largest market behind the US, is facing a legal issue as Germany is currently fielding a law protecting third-party contract workers with minimum wages, social security measures and proper grievance addressing methods. It doesn't take a degree to figure that if Amazon were forced to change this, their profits would be affected.In the end, Amazon is a company currently to be reckoned with on an international basis. However, I believe it's only begun facing some of its more existential issues, which are comprised of (among other things) worker treatment, warehouse conditions, delivery driver treatment, strikes/legal issues, suicides, differential pricing, product substitution, selling Wikipedia articles as books, Kindle content issues, tax avoidance across the world, animal cruelty, antisemitic content and products detailing on how to behave as a pedophile where the S.F Chronicle later described the company's behavior as: "" defended the book, then removed it, then reinstated it, and then removed it again"". (Source)Handling risk in an investment is what I do when I pick companies and try to value them. In the end, I've found forecasting Amazon in any meaningful way to be too risky of a proposition/investment basis. The company may excel and grow, or it may just as easily become increasingly marginalized as legal, labor and tax issues catch up with them. That being said, I would never bet against the company.Second, and as I see it, more importantly (and with more relevance), the macro situation which includes tariffs/trade wars, Brexit, as well as the European TNT integration, has weighed on company results for quite some time at this stage.(Source: 2020 Presentation)I want to take this time to field a concern which I answer on a real-life basis quite often when it comes to ""defending"" my investments in banks/finance from people who believe that the national cash-less revolution will put banks out of business.People have a tendency of overestimating the impact of the consumer-grade market in companies and/or banks (in the context of banks, I'm talking about services like credit cards and cash management, not mortgages). The fact is that most banks' primary generation of profit isn't tied to issuing credit cards or the associated fees, but mortgages and access to capital/credit markets.Similarly, while FedEx B2C-business is experiencing issues, part of the meat in FedEx is in the B2B-business, which has significantly stronger overall margins. This is in part why compared to the Brexit and tariff uncertainity, the Amazon issue is not all that significant in the longer term. Policy and tariffs, on the other hand, will significantly impact company profits, which will once again open the door to global trade and restore equilibrium in global trade, which in the end is what fuels large parts of FedEx operations. I also want to point out that FedEx Ground Market share, despite all the problems, has a strong historical track record.(Source: 2020 Presentation)There is no question that FedEx was heavily impacted by the trade war, and every investor who invested when this was the most significant, has seen the hurt that company operations have taken. However, the continued (and increased) negativity in the face of improved relations and the lightening of tariffs is illogical. The risk to FedEx, the primary risk, is increased trade uncertainity which compresses global trade further - the opposite is happening.(Source: 2020 Presentation)Let's remember that despite everything and sell-side analysts arguing as though the sky is falling, some of the worst trends in decades and a very serious trade war has barely managed to take a real >1% dent out of FDX operating margins on a 3Y-basis - adjusted or GAAP.No, the real issue for FedEx during the year was earnings, which due to a variety of factors dropped like a stone.In my last article, I wrote that:The company has reacted appropriately and done this. Now we're looking at a different situation where things may be turning around, yet the market is still treating the stock as though the slump will not only continue flat but worsen. I don't see the catalyst for this development - and I don't consider Amazon to be a likely catalyst to cause it, given the extremely low contract volume which FedEx had.The bottom line going into 2020 is that while 2018 and especially 2019 were negative years for the company, the main factors which usually are considered risks don't, as I see it, hold much water in the long term. This brings us to valuation.In the end, it's all about what we pay for something. A company with currently-poor profits may be buyable if you're able to buy a prospect at a few times prospective earnings.In FedEx's case, the current valuation continues to show appeal.(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)The company currently trades at an average weighted P/E of 12.3 and offers a conservative yield of 1.7%. It's not as good as what we've seen, but still pretty damn excellent. As we can see, this takes into expectation a significant earnings drop, followed by years of recovery as CapEx intensity gets lower, macro returns to normal levels and trade resumes its activity.(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)Even based on earnings growth estimates, which given an average EPS growth of 2.39% (thanks to the slump) comes in around a P/E of 13X, you'd be well-covered at more or less sideways trading at current valuation, netting you a market-beating CAGR of 10.9%. If we start modeling according to historical market valuations, even a multiple expansion to a historical average (15.7X) would net you profits in the form of 16.5% CAGR.We can do better, however. Let's cut the average earnings growth estimates by half, expecting (beyond forecast years), a near-flat growth rate of below 5% per year, in a company that typically averages double digits or high single digits.(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)Even in such a, I would argue, conservative scenario, you need not worry about your returns on a long-term basis, as they would continue to be market-beating. Your invested capital would be well-preserved even in the case of a sideways/completely flat trading environment, bringing you a CAGR of ~5% based on trading at an average weighted P/E of 10X.There's some ambiguity to these forecasts. FedEx isn't exactly known for providing analyst guidance good enough to make reliable forecasts, represented by a 36% failure rate even with a 10% margin of error. However, given the overall ""protection"" in the forecasting here, where even negative valuation development over the next 5 years doesn't result in a loss of capital, I believe this can be seen as acceptable.People have a tendency to overestimate the impact of certain things. Analysts are one of these groups - and in this case, the Amazon impact is, as I see it, grossly overestimated. What's more, it seems that many of them also underestimate the difference between volume and quality. Pure volume, as Amazon provided FedEx with, makes no difference if the quality/profitability/margins of the volume is poor. This was my argument months ago - and I saw the Amazon exit as positive for the company strictly on the basis of contract margins, who instead can (and are) focus on quality of service instead of strictly price of service. In this context, this means focusing on customers/segments with better margins. FedEx shareholders should love this - I certainly do.So, the issue for FedEx, as I see them, weren't actually Amazon but instead macro. The global trade war/Brexit contributed to a horrid performance in EU, with spillover effects affecting manufacturing and industrial performance, which ultimately impacts FedEx performance.There was also continued integration issues with TNT in Europe, which are set to be solved going into 1H20 however. E-commerce (Not Amazon, E-commerce as a whole) is one segment for the company, and an important one, but one the company is working to improve margin-wise, which includes steps such as:Because of all of these factors, the core question of value here is one I see as a positive one. The value of FedEx is certainly here at a valuation of ~12x earnings, and the upside can be said to be between 5-10% CAGR on a fairly conservative basis.It's not as much as some of the companies I invest in. That's the reason I'm not calling this a ""Very bullish"" or ""Table-pounding buy"". It's a good buy, and an excellent way to get some shipping/logistics exposure. It lacks the significant upside however to warrant any more positivity than that, as I see it. There's seems to be a clear split between those who believe FedEx is not worth investing in, and those who believe in the ""Very Bullish"" thesis that FedEx will rocket to the moon in a short while.Me, I come down somewhere between them. FedEx is certainly worth your time, and I would say your money. I don't expect 15-25% CAGR out of my investment, however. Market-beating rates of return, even if they are barely that, are good enough for me at this time. It was the disconnect between the bull and bearish sides here which made me want to clarify my own position here.Thank you for reading.Continued undervaluation warrants a ""Bullish"" and ""BUY"" stance for FedEx due to a potential 5-10% CAGR over the coming years. While risks still exist, the valuation is appealing enough to warrant a second look, if you invest for the long term."
4314818,31441,2020-01-01T21:14:43-05:00,"FDX and UPS increased fees for bulky items.It seems like a sound business decision for FDX. It could help protect margins in certain segments of the business.However, the move will likely not be about to keep its total operating income from falling further.Sell FDX.","Source: Barron'sThe debate over the direction of the U.S. economy rages on. I believe we are at peak economy. However, the incessant melt-up in financial markets appears to mask the true strength of the economy. If the economy turns down, then the transportation sector could be the first to get hit. That puts FedEx (FDX) in the spotlight. FedEx and UPS (UPS) recently added a $24 fee for certain bulky items:FedEx needs to increase revenue anyway it can. Its most-recent quarterly results were underwhelming. The company reported revenue of $17.3 billion, down 3% Y/Y. Revenue for FedEx Express and FedEx Freight fell 5% and 4%, respectively. FedEx Ground revenue rose by low single-digits. A few months ago FedEx did not renew its ground shipping contract with Amazon (AMZN), which is likely to become a FedEx competitor. The loss of Amazon business hurt revenue. Amazon recently blocked third-party sellers from using FedEx Ground for Prime deliveries. This could further hurt FedEx's top line. Source: Shock ExchangeThe company's operating income fell hard. Operating income was $554 million, down over 50% Y/Y. Operating income margin was 3.3%, down about 370 basis points versus the year-earlier period. On a segment basis, operating income at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground both fell by double digits. Operating income for FedEx Freight fell 5%.FedEx Ground is expanding to six and seven-day delivery. Management intimated the margin erosion was due to rising costs to expand the company's infrastructure, yet revenue from expanding its services had not caught up with rising costs yet. That may partially explain the erosion in margins. However, I believe FedEx is experiencing a loss of price power. Using the limited information in the 10-Q on revenue per segment, I performed a high analysis of operating income margin per segment (excluding corporate eliminations).I estimate that operating income margin for FedEx Express was 2.4%, down about 370 basis points versus the year-earlier period. I estimate that operating income margins for FedEx Ground fell 450 basis points, while margins for FedEx Freight were practically unchanged. With an operating income margin of 7.9%, FedEx Freight seems to have the most pricing power of the company's three operating segments. If the company is building the FedEx Ground infrastructure then why would margins for FedEx Express fall so hard? Market chatter previously suggested FedEx may have been slashing prices to fill planes. Such chatter could eventually gain legs.E-commerce is FedEx's fastest-growing segment. Business-to-consumer (""B2C"") connotes companies selling products directly to consumers. Its popularity has grown with the explosion of the Internet. Management is trying to position FedEx as a major player in the B2C market.FedEx has also invested heavily in technology. Its Dynamic Route Optimization (""DRO"") system provides real time data to service providers, allowing them to optimize route timing. Service providers can also use DRO to accommodate the increase in packages. Ultimately, DRO should allow FedEx and its service providers to handle increased e-commerce volume. This should improve efficiency and productivity throughout the company's network.The increase in fees for bulky items should help FedEx grow revenue and improve margins for that product category. Pursuant to ground transportation, FedEx is not the only game in town. UPS is a worthy competitor. Amazon is expected to build out its ground transportation network as well. If Amazon continues to steer business away from FedEx then it could continue to create headwinds for FedEx. The company could enjoy pricing power for bulky items for the foreseeable future. However, I expect the company to face headwinds in other areas.In my opinion, the global economy has likely peaked. A stagnant economy, particularly in the industrial sector, could cause the overall transportation sector to decline. I believe FedEx's infrastructure is built for volume. If that volume does not materialize - due to waning demand or competitive pressures - then its operating income margins could continue to deteriorate.Raising fees on bulky items appears to be a sound business decision by FedEx. It likely will not stop the slide in operating income. FDX is down about 10% Y/Y. It will likely fall further. Sell the stock."

The likely acquirer is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The gangster move: a merger with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).In July 2017 we predicted, ""If Bezos tomorrow said, 'We see overnight delivery as a huge opportunity,' the $150 billion of market cap of DHL, FedEx, and UPS would begin leaking to Amazon.""This has happened. Since the launch of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivery service in February 2018, FedEx has lost $25 billion (39%) in value, despite the S&P's 24% gain. Amazon has added $240 billion (33%). In less than two years, Amazon captured nearly one-fifth of the market for e-commerce deliveries in the U.S.Since 2014, U.S. e-commerce has increased 84%, creating a massive opportunity for the delivery industry. But instead, there has been a transfer of wealth from FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. government to Amazon. Amazon enters high-friction, low-margin businesses as a means of differentiating low-friction, high-margin businesses (AWS and AMG).Network effects, cheap capital, idolatry of innovators, and a feckless DOJ/FTC have resulted in a monopoly era where a wildly profitable business (phones, digital marketing, loyalty programs, cloud, Yoda dolls) can generate such staggering value (""antimatter"") that entire industries become loss leaders (""features"") to differentiate and protect the antimatter. Netscape, the fastest-growing software firm in history, went from antimatter to feature when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) began bundling Internet Explorer with Office.I served on the board of a visual commerce SaaS firm (Olapic) until we sold for $130 million in 2016. There was a great deal of discussion on whether to sell. I urged the founders, naturally optimistic about the firm's prospects, to sell. The difference between $1 million and $10 million in wealth is meaningful (go big), but the difference between 0 and $1 million is profound (sell). Every entrepreneur should bank enough money to provide economic security for their family… at any opportunity. For every CNBC story on Spiegel and Zuck turning down offers and going on to capture billions, there are dozens of founders who should have sold. Pro tip: your VCs will encourage you to ""be in it to win it,"" and to keep going, as they are already rich. Assume you are not Mark Zuckerberg.Speaking of Zuck, I think he'd be happier if he'd sold to Microsoft (I don't know him, so this is pure speculation). A powerful algorithm for happiness is to be wealthy but anonymous. Perhaps as a coping mechanism for realizing the significant damage he levies on the world, Zuck has developed the attributes of a sociopath. Instead, he could have worked in Seattle for 27 months, retired to Hawaii, invested in rockets, owned a football team, and produced Cats for the big screen.With any software start-up, there is a non-zero probability that you wake up the next day and find that a better-resourced firm (Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Adobe) has deployed 200 engineers to copy your product, bundle it with their stack for free, or near free, and... welcome to zero. I believe this is happening to Slack (NYSE:WORK), but more slowly than Netscape, as Microsoft's General Counsel has likely coached Satya to charge a nominal fee for Teams and let Slack bleed out, instead of putting a bullet in its head and stirring the DOJ from a 3-Ambien slumber.FedEx is in the midst of being featurized by Amazon, who can make investments across their vertical stack that FedEx can't match, as Amazon has antimatter (Prime, AWS, AMG). The Memphis firm's most recent earnings were a sh*t-show with top- and bottom-line misses, drivel about a slowdown in air freight, and (my favorite) an unfavorable calendar - a Kabuki dance attempting to distract investors from the fact they're being featurized by Amazon.FedEx shareholders have woken up in an M. Night Shyamalan nightmare. Instead of seeing dead people, investors are haunted by Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans with an arrow the shape of a smile on their side. Everywhere. They might as well be German Panzer tanks fighting a white-and-purple cavalry of FedEx trucks. There will be a lot of macho battle cries from FedEx, some heroism, and an increasing stench of death. (Can't help it, I love WWII war metaphors.)To be fair, Amazon is a better-run company than FedEx, who has stuck their chin out with an offering that, from a consumer standpoint, feels 1995. In addition, Fred Smith spent a great deal of time lobbying the President to lower corporate taxes so he could free up capital to buy back shares, instead of fighting Amazon.The clean-sheet, technology-driven innovation at Amazon, coupled with cheaper capital, has caught FedEx flatfooted. Amazon:As Amazon is vertical, the return process is nearly frictionless. I have an Amazon 4-star store on the street level of my office. I can take a product downstairs, hand it to them, and they handle the rest. A return via FedEx involves printers, labels, and additional costs to have them package.Despite what feels like an invading army of Amazon vans, the reality is the Seattle firm is doing more with less - better service with less CapEx.Evading regulators, tax avoidance, a 1,000-person communications department, exploiting our culture's idolatry of innovators - these weapons have rendered CNBC Amazon's plaything. The result is a firm that throws its weight around like no other. Amazon banned merchants from using FedEx right before the holidays. That's like staging a mock homecoming queen ceremony so you can pour pig's blood on your competitor in front of the senior class.""Deliver with Amazon. Be your own boss. Great earnings. Flexible hours. Make more time for whatever drives you."" Amazon has taken a page from Uber (NYSE:UBER) and is leveraging the romanticization of entrepreneurship, the need for flexibility, and the decreasing options of non-degreed workers in rural areas. There are already stories depicting breakneck delivery schedules that obviate luxuries such as bathroom breaks. FedEx drivers get paternity leave and (gasp) health insurance.Sell or merge. FedEx stock is cheap and will get cheaper. EBITDA will decline as management will be forced to make incremental investments in a futile game of catch-up. But the real virus infecting the stock has already taken hold of the delivery firm's corpus. Amazon did a Jedi mind trick last week. Banning merchants from using FedEx convinced the markets, with a single press release, that FedEx has regressed from ""growth"" to ""mature"" to a declining firm.A Walmart acquisition would mean the retail giant goes (more) vertical for an 11% dilution ($38 billion vs. $340 billion market caps). Walmart would recognize economies of scale (accretive), buttress their grocery offering (the gangster unlock of the last five years in business), burnish their data set, and go Yoda on Amazon's a$$ - old, but not to be trifled with. FedEx solves their succession problem (CEO is 75), gets 5,000 well-staffed distribution centers (stores), and sells at a high. Time is not on their side. The stock price today will seem overvalued tomorrow.A more interesting and bolder tie-up would be with Shopify. The pride of Canada boasts a $45 billion market cap vs. FedEx's $38 billion (think about that). The combined firm would be a viable option to Amazon (the anti-Amazon) - increasingly attractive positioning to a growing cohort of merchants. Retail is an enormous and fragmented business that wants out of the Amazon gulag.Shopify-Ex would offer retailers something they don't get from Amazon: partnership. Newco would provide merchants a lot of the great taste of Amazon (robust e-commerce tools and fulfillment) without the calories (merchants keep their data, control the customer, branding, no private label launches on backs of merchant data).The much larger firm would have a combined market cap of $83 billion, high single-digit revenue growth, and likely register multiple expansion as the complexion of the business would move to recurring revenue. It would captivate the markets (see above: CNBC's plaything). This could be the biggest thing since Tim Hortons.In 24 months, FedEx will not exist in its current form. A lack of innovation, and a competitor who can overwhelm enemies with cheap capital and Jedi mind tricks, has featurized one of the great success stories of modern business. The resulting firm, post acquisition of FedEx, will offer an increase in shareholder value, superior customer experience, fewer jobs, less tax revenue, and no paternity leave.We are barrelling toward a country with 350 million serfs serving 3 million lords.

4313371,42661,2019-12-19T12:57:25-05:00,FedEx reported plunging earnings and margins this week.Valuations suggest there is little upside right now and a lot of unprotected downside risk.I provide current valuation based on multiple methodologies and some thoughts on paths to a turnaround.,"Keeping a company soaring ahead straight and level is a complex task. You must constantly be aware of what is happening around you and anticipate changes so as to control your own course and arrive safely at your goal. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has been having some trouble doing this of late. Today I'll consider the outlook going forward for this popular dividend income target.FedExFedEx continues to see strong competitive pressures in its core ground and air shipping business. Office supplies and services also will continue to see headwinds from direct retail competition and continued migration to electronic office records and internet business to business. Against this difficult outlook, we see shrinking margins as FedEx eliminates prime time holiday season home delivery premium surcharges and cuts margins to respond to competitive pressure. The company also has stopped providing deep discount shipping rates to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The effect of this was the trigger of the early December 2018 plunge, as market fears of the break of relationship between FedEx and Amazon caused investors to shun FDX shares. Prices did not begin to stabilize and recover until after Christmas 2018, and after rising to April 2019 highs of about $199, have been in a declining channel trend, now shifting to consolidation at the $150 to $158 price levels. Current analyst sentiment leans from a neutral to modestly bullish outlook.The company has a good dividend history, reaching Dividend Achiever status (10+ years of rising dividends). However, the company has now gone seven quarters without a dividend increase and appears likely about to lose that status. Also of note is just 10 years ago, FDX failed to make its yearly dividend increase during the 2008/9 financial crisis. These brief interruptions for good cause do show responsible management actions in shepherding cash flow during difficult times. However, they do also indicate that management is not primarily focused on maintaining a strong safe dividend as a top priority. Although the company has outperformed the S&P 500 for most of its history, total net return has been negative for the past five years. Chad Brand took a recent walk through the FedEx dividend and share buyback programs along with contrasting them to cash flows. He points out that FDX has only generated $1.6 billion in FCF (free cash flow) over the past six fiscal years, while expending $14.1 billion on dividend distributions and share buyback programs. The clear conclusion is that these are being funded largely from taking on debt. This, coupled with negative total net return for the past five years, leads me to label FedEx as a yield trap, attempting to prop up share price with unsustainable distributions and buybacks. Dividend growth investors should be aware.Payout ratios confirm the past five years are not sustainable, first with cash payout ratio going negative and now earnings payout also far in excess of 100%. A look at key financial metrics on a per-share basis reveals declining per-share free cash flow and earnings for the past three years even as revenues have more than doubled. Funds from operations have been gyrating widely and are misleading even at that. With debt sharply rising and cash flow minimal and falling, along with declining earnings, the increased revenues are not reaching the bottom line, squandered on debt to engineer false-looking shareholder metrics, not to invest in future growth.Over the past 10 years, debt had piled on to a prior clean balance sheet, while FCF is up only modestly and earnings are in decline. ROI is in free fall, along with declining operating margins. This over the same period that debt is climbing. These are not good signs. In summary, we have a company that is not growing its bottom-line cash flow and is borrowing to engineer the look of shareholder returns as more attractive than company operating performance suggests. The changing face of the competitive environment along with FedEx's diversification into office services/shipping centers anchored by the acquisition of Kinko's, has diverted funds and attention from the core shipping business, tying up large amounts of capital.The picture is not all bleak. I have often spoken of the Nexus, where e-commerce and traditional retail meet. With a global footprint of shipping/delivery-pickup points, along with last mile services to home and office, FedEx is in a strong position to occupy a key place in the Nexus.Furthermore, a paradigm shift to automated drone last mile and robotic transfer stations should begin to offer opportunities for FedEx to slash labor costs. To do so will require significant new capital investment in these new technologies. Given the swollen and growing debt of the company, I expect divestiture of the FedEx Kinko's centers and other non core business will be needed in the immediate future to free up capital and redirect employment of credit. Management still can turn things around if it is willing to take these needed steps to return to core business based on a platform grounded in new technology and designed to meet customer needs at the Nexus.An additional opportunity exists for FedEx to lead in a new niche. With more and more international e-consumer sales and a changing tax situation and outlook for internet sales, the use of duty-free facilities for pick up of international packages could become a major service segment globally. FedEx is already established with a presence at many major international airports with its air transport and transfer station facilities. Adding duty-free shop presence would be very easy for the company with these contacts and facilities already in place. This new service would enable someone that is planning international travel in the near future to then make international internet purchases and have them delivered to the FedEx duty-free station at the airport the buyer will be transiting anyway. This allows avoidance of taxes and import duty. An added bonus is the security of the entire delivery chain. As an expat living in Brazil, I know how expensive import duties are (100% of cost, plus shipping frees, and a bit more added for administrative fees, bringing the total fees to more than 100% of the purchase price). The paperwork can be difficult and confusing for imports also and the last mile local in-country mail delivery fraught with peril from loss, theft, fraud, and damage.There is a huge potential untapped market for this service and FedEx holds a good position to fill it, charging premium rates for such a service while still saving the customer money on the net cost to them. In 2018, Amazon generated $65 billion in international revenues, much of it from retail sales. Just 20% of this from duty-free center services would mean $13 billion in new high-margin revenue to FedEx. A 50% figure (near $30 billion) is quite realistic even.Current management will need to show a clear plan and path for the future. This will be critical within the next few quarters. Demonstrated proof of success implementation will need to begin not far thereafter. Hopefully, a strong activist investor will step in to guide and monitor such efforts in the near future now that share price has begun to stabilize and recover within the range of fair values for the company as it currently is positioned.Having looked at this need for a turnaround and some of the opportunities to drive one, let's look at valuation.Historically, FedEx has been driven as a growth business with a foundation anchored on safe dividends with strong compound growth. This has changed in the past 18 months to a look of slow to no growth and a dividend that is no longer growing and does not even look sustainable at current distributions. Thus, we have departed what used to be a strong income stock valuation, well suited for YDP evaluation, to a more complex scene.YDP fair value for the current $2.60 of annual dividend distributions at the five-year historical average yield 0.61% is $426.23. Let me assure you that such a valuation is not even available as a dream, let alone reality. A valuation based on a more realistic yield rate of 1.65% such as has been the ballpark trend since it became apparent that growth has stalled and dividends are at risk provides a YDP valuation at a more realistic $157.58. Given the lack of current long-term dividend sustainability, that figure should be considered the high-side limit to values presently.Traditional valuation metrics based on financial ratios showed many well-correlated indicators in the past until mid-2017. These include Price/OpCashFlow, Price/Sales, and to a lesser extent, P/E. Correlation of these valuations to actual market prices has deteriorated for each of these factors post 2017, with P/E becoming completely delinked from as a value indicator. P/OpCashFlow, and to a slightly lesser degree P/S also, remain useful valuation tools. Currently, these provide valuation of $173.70 and $224.30, respectively. The lower, at $173.70, is in fairly good agreement with my current YDP view. Therefore, I suggest the $175.00 valuation with moderate confidence at this time and a lot of downside risk going forward. For instance, a 25% dividend cut would be expected to reduce valuation to $118.00 per share.The recent key pattern of note on the technical chart is the development of a sideways consolidation trend in the higher half of the declining channel for the past two months. This was forming a new technical bottom in the $151 range. However, the new earnings release and call on 12/17/19 have triggered a breakdown below that support. Shares will almost certainly test the $139.50 recent support of October 2019 and likely will also test the January 2016 lows at $120.00. A $118.00 low would be consistent with valuation at a 25% cut of the current dividend. Overall, we see a company with little near-term upside and a lot of downside exposure with little in the way of technical support to catch a falling knife.I see no indications in this week's phone call that management is considering or prepared to make the changes needed to fix the flat tire that has halted FDX. The reported plan is to slash capex now that the ill-timed air fleet replacement is completed. The lack of capex funding precludes timely movement into drones, robotics, and development of a position in the Nexus. It would appear that only an activist investor or takeover can turn this wrong way convoy around at this time.I have provided my EII subscribers with ideas writing covered options to help manage positions in this falling knife and to generate 19.4% annual yield rate on sidelined cash while waiting for shares to drop below $145.00, while protecting from (at the time a week ago) $17.00 in downside market risk.Thanks for taking the time to read my work.

4316574,54272,2020-01-14T08:00:00-05:00,FedEx is witnessing peak pessimism with its P/E compressed due to Amazon fears and EPS depressed because of transitory factors.Amazon would never like to lower prices for non-Amazon eCommerce players which are FedEx’s target market.End markets are bottoming.Sell-side is underestimating margin recovery.The stock can see ~25% upside over the next six months and potentially double in medium to long term.,"This article was selected to be shared with Seeking Alpha PRO+ subscribers - find out more here.FedEx's (FDX) stock has been under pressure over the last couple of years thanks to the U.S.-China trade dispute (which has led to a slowdown in industrial - most profitable end market for FedEx), uncertainty over Brexit which has affected European economies, issues with TNT integration, upfront cost incurred in expanding six and seven days delivery, and exiting Amazon (AMZN) business.While Wall Street is currently obsessed with Amazon threat and fears a pricing war, the reality is exactly opposite with pricing remaining strong and capacity tightening for non-Amazon customers. Amazon's real competitors are other retailers not FedEx. Any pricing war with FedEx will help lower cost for its competitors who rely on FedEx. Amazon has no reason to lower prices for non-Amazon e-tailers at its cost.Things have started to improve on the macro front with phase I of the trade deal due to be signed this week. Odds of orderly Brexit have also improved with Boris Johnson's win. The company is focused on filling its spare capacity with high quality volume at a better margin. This coupled with cost savings from an 8% reduction in flight hours for express business, TNT integration benefits as well as easing comparisons will help the company generate significant operating margin expansion going forward. I believe the stock can see at least ~25% upside over the next six months with a potential to double over medium to long term.Of late, many sell-side analysts, investors, bloggers and professors are saying that Amazon can enter pricing war with FedEx and UPS (UPS) to gain the #1 spot and establish a monopoly in the Logistics space. The reality is exactly opposite. Both FedEx and UPS announced a healthy rate increase of 4.9% this year for their express and ground business. They even started levying $24 fees on packages weighing more than 50 pounds. Earlier this limit was 70 pounds. Amazon itself increased its prices by 3% in 2020. Does it look like a precursor to price war?Think about it logically. Would Amazon like to increase or decrease prices for its retail competitors? Amazon's real competitors are other retailers not FedEx. Any pricing war with FedEx will help/lower cost for its competitors who rely on FedEx. Further, if Amazon goes too competitive in pricing for goods outside of its network (i.e. other than Amazon and vendors who sells through its platform) it will mean higher cost/lower service quality for its own network.Amazon entered logistics industry to better serve its customers. Amazon logistics' aim is to provide the company a competitive advantage over other online retailers in terms of price/service quality to its customers as well as vendors. It will not help Amazon if its competitors start to get lower rates at its cost.Also, any meaningful expansion outside of its own network might invite antitrust concerns. I don't think management is looking to spin off Amazon logistics as it will take away a key competitive advantage for the company. With both President Trump and (billionaire hating) Democrats vying for its blood, expanding outside its core vendors might not be a smart move. I also don't agree with the notion that it will take away the business from UPS. Ideally Amazon would like to keep ~80% of the volume on some of the most profitable routes and leave ~20% of the business to UPS.FedEx's strategy in the current environment is to focus on non-Amazon eCommerce business which is around 56% of the total eCommerce business. This makes sense as this market is growing at a healthy rate and FedEx has much more pricing power in this market due to its fragmented nature.FedEx has also postponed all non-essential capex (i.e., not essential for safety service, or replacement, or obsolescence). FedEx capex spend may look higher in its financial statement because it is replacing 159 A310 and MD-10 aircraft. Once that is complete by fiscal '22 year end, there will be a significant reduction in the corporation's ongoing capital expenditures on both an absolute basis and percent of revenues. UPS is following similar footsteps and has decreased its capex guidance for 2020 by $500 mn on last quarter's earnings call.So what we are moving towards is actually a very rational logistics supply environment for non Amazon eCommerce players. This will be very positive from pricing perspective.I believe FedEx's strategy will pay handsomely. Think about the kind of operating leverage a transportation company, whose existing network is getting filled with incremental volumes at higher pricing, can generate. FedEx is likely to witness the same over the course of next few years. I expect its operating margin to surpass its previous peak over the next couple of years. Wall Street is not modeling it and is in for a big surprise.When it comes to transportation companies, investors, analysts as well as management often give too much emphasis on volumes rather than the quality/ pricing/yield it is getting on those volumes. While incremental volumes may help short term results because of more lane density, going too competitive on pricing is not the best strategy for long-term returns. It's difficult to renegotiate prices higher with a customer who has shifted to you just for price rather than quality of service. Also, you might have to let go a higher yield opportunity just because your lanes are filled with low quality volume. Service quality and employee morale also suffers leading to further attrition of good quality customers.Take for example the case of LTL industry in the last decade. Back in 2009 when LTL industry was witnessing pricing war and most of the players were going too competitive on price to take share from YRC Worldwide (YRCW). Some players like Conway even went to the extent of cutting their employees salary temporarily to make sure they remain profitable while taking share from YRCW. Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) didn't participate in this pricing war and continued focusing on its service. A decade later, Old Dominion's operating margins have improved to more than 20% versus 5.65% in 2009 and its stock price is ~20x higher than its 2009 lows. Conway, on the other hand, saw a short term increase in its stock price in 2009 but soon found it struggling because of low quality volume. It spent next several years trying to turn around its business and raise prices to an acceptable level and then finally had to sell itself to XPO Logistics (XPO).Last year, there was an article in Wall Street Journal calling for Fred Smith to reinvent FedEx. He has already done it by changing its focus on the customers who are paying it appropriately for its service and this will start showing in the numbers as 2020 progresses.In addition to severing ties with Amazon, one thing which greatly impacted FedEx over the last couple of years was slowdown in global trade which affected its industrial end market. The company's industrial or B2B business is much more profitable than consumer or B2C business (which includes ecommerce) due to greater lane density and stronger yields. Recent development surrounding the U.S.-China trade deal as well as improved probability of orderly Brexit post Boris Johnson win marks a turning point in global trade environment. With China taking steps to lower tariffs and open up its economy there is a chance that global trade reaches a new high in upcoming cycle.Surprisingly, some sell-side analysts are still posting negative commentary on FedEx citing macro concerns, which I believe make little sense at the bottom of the cycle. For eg., Argus research analyst recently downgraded the company citing trade, tariff and overseas macro concerns. I believe this downgrade is unwarranted as the worst is already behind us and these factors will be a tailwind going forward. If anything the stock should be upgraded as the worst is likely behind us.Similarly Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger downgraded the stock after its last quarter earnings with title of his report being ""Although it may be the Nadir, we are moving to perform rating.""Who downgrades a transportation stock at the bottom of the cycle?Further, speaking to Reuters, he commented,""The bottom line, we think this could be a good stock as we head into 2020. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised if shares didn't close down all that much on Wednesday.""Who downgrades a stock in December and calls that it can be a good stock heading into the next year?Clearly he lacks convictions and is hedging his bets. While sell-side has luxury to make confusing calls, institutional investors can't afford to be underweight a company of this size for long if it starts to recover.Management has been pretty clear and straight forward that worst is behind us and things are likely to improve going forward. Below are some of the relevant excerpts from the company's recent earnings call.While I understand investors' disappointment with management, ignoring the recent positive development on macro front might not be a wise approach. Some of the leading indicators like China's industrial production have already started improving and there is a very strong case for cyclical recovery in industrial economy and global trade going forward.In addition to improving macros helping sales, the company's operating margins are also likely to improve significantly. The following is a list of some of the key points to remember while thinking about the margins:So, there is a clear path for FedEx cost improvement for the next few years which coupled with operating leverage from recovering volume and higher pricing can push FedEx margin higher.Investors and sell-side analysts are somehow not modeling much improvement in margins going forward. Their typical estimates are around 30bps to 50 bps improvement in margins in FY 2021 (FedEx's fiscal year runs from June to May). This is surprising because I believe an 8% reduction in flight hours itself can save several hundreds of millions for express segment whose total annual expenses are ~$35 bn. Out of $35 bn ~$13.5 bn is salary and employee benefit. I believe ~10% of this or $1.35 bn is for pilots who are paid based on flight hours. So, a 8% reduction in flight hours will save ~108 mn in pilot compensation. Fuel is approximately $3.3 bn annually for express. So, an 8% reduction will save over $264 mn. For maintenance and repairs, which is ~$1.9 bn I am assuming a 4% savings (because all of that is not plane related) which equates to ~$76 mn. So, the total savings from these three components is ~$450 mn. There will also be some saving from landing fees, but I am ignoring that for now. Even if we remain cautious and take just $350 mn in saving, it can add more than a dollar to EPS from flight hour reductions alone. (Calculation $350 mn multiplied by 0.75 (tax rate) divided by 262 mn share count = $1 increment in EPS).Combine this with benefits from TNT integration (~$750 mn run-rate saving post completion in FY2022, they have not given FY2021 component but it will likely be meaningful), recovery in ground business margins (management has guided for low teens margins in Q4 (ending May) in ground segment), operating leverage from recovery (express segment will likely see ~35% incremental margins) and easing comps. I believe the company's margins can easily improve by more than 100 bps in FY 2021 and I am likely to prove conservative here.For the current fiscal year, the consensus is approximately 5.3% for operating margins and $69.2 bn revenues. For the next year, assuming 6.3% operating margins and $72 bn in revenues (consensus estimates), we have $4536 mn in operating profit. This is $868 mn more than current year's consensus operating profit of $3668 mn (=5.3%*69.2). Applying 25% tax rate to incremental profit and dividing by 262 mn share count, we have $2.48 in incremental EPS for the next year. Add this to the current year EPS of $10.80, we get $13.28 in EPS for FY2021. I expect the company's operating margins to completely recover by FY2022 as the company realizes benefit of TNT integration and continues to fill its infrastructure with higher quality volume. This would mean an all time high EPS and I believe the stock price will also recover completely.Valuations and where can the stock go?FedEx stock price is currently witnessing peak pessimism of late with its P/E compressed because of fears about Amazon threat and EPS depressed because of transitory factors. I believe both will change this year and the sentiment on the stock will take a U-turn.FedEx is a core provider for non Amazon eCommerce which is 56% of the market. The company has a significant pricing power in this market and it is impossible to even think of this market without FedEx. UPS and USPS both have relatively higher cost structure in this market due to unionized and government workforce, respectively.The company's end markets are poised to recover, and with significant cost savings from flight reductions, TNT integration and other factors discussed above, the company is poised to increase its operating margins significantly. The company has 10%+ long term operating margin goal. No one takes that seriously but I believe the next few years of margin recovery which starts this year can take the company there. With the company not expanding its infrastructure unless necessary, and taking additional revenues with better pricing on existing infrastructure; its operating leverage might surprise analysts and investors positively.FedEx is not a stock where institutional investors can be relatively underweight without impacting their performance meaningfully. During the downturn it was ok, but as the recovery starts I believe they will quickly shrug irrational Amazon fears and focus on what is happening on the ground level instead. Insiders are already buying at these levels and I believe institutional investors to soon join.So, where can the stock go?In the short term (less than six months) I expect the stock price to move towards $200 as investors realize the bottom is in place. The company's earnings over the next two quarters and forward guidance will help them better appreciate the recovery cycle over the next year, and the actual cost saving and margin improvement potential for the company. The stock has traded over an average P/E of ~13.5 over in the recent past. However, a cyclical company recovering from bottom usually gets a higher multiple. So, I believe a 15x multiple will be more appropriate. Applying it to my EPS estimate of $13.28 for FY 2021(ending May), gives a target price of $200. My target may prove conservative if investors realize the reality of Amazon competition and shrug off some of the irrational fears faster. This may cause P/E multiple to expand faster and move towards high teens. Also, as mentioned above, my EPS might prove conservative.In the medium term (12 to 18 months), I believe the company will regain its margins completely and the stock can see a new all time high. Longer term, the stock can potentially double as its margins continue to expand with it taking higher quality volume on existing infrastructure.The biggest risk to the company is policy related. If Trump trade war reignites and causes macros to worsen, the stock might be negatively impacted. In general FedEx is quite levered to global trade and anything which impacts global trade negatively will be bad for the company.If TNT integration doesn't go as planned or European economy continues to worsen, that's another risk.Also, the company's P/E multiple depends on investor perception of Amazon threat. If investors continue to overestimate Amazon threat it will negatively impact FedEx's P/E multiple. Ironically, UPS which has a much larger Amazon exposure (I believe 10% of UPS volumes are Amazon related) receives less negative coverage and trades at a better multiple!"
4314626,44781,2019-12-31T01:00:12-05:00,"FedEx has falling margins, growth problems and a frozen dividend.I haven't been happy with FDX's falling guidance and management's plans to turn things around.So, I exited my FDX position and reallocated the funds towards BAM and BPR, increasing my passive income stream and dividend growth prospects.","I sold my FedEx (FDX) stake this week.I hated doing so because I sold the shares at a loss. I hate locking in losses, because unrealized losses always have the potential to turn into gains. Furthermore, when you own high quality companies, this tends to be the likely long-term outcome. However, FedEx has really disappointed me in recent quarters operationally and this fundamental performance has trickled down into the dividend metrics in a negative way.The company’s fundamentals are deteriorating before my eyes. And, earlier in the year, FedEx froze its dividend. In short, in more ways than one, my FDX shares were no longer meeting expectations and with that in mind, while doing a bit of end of the year portfolio/income stream rebalancing, I decided to sell FedEx and replace it with a combination of Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) and Brookfield Property REIT (BPR).Needless to say, FDX has been one of my most disappointing investments in a while. I began accumulating my FDX position in July of 2017, purchasing an entry level position at $209.70. At the time, shares were down about $10 from recent highs and I decided to take advantage of the little dip to buy what I thought was a fairly valued blue chip with strong, double digit dividend growth potential.When it comes to FDX, I looked like a genius at first. It didn’t take long for shares to rise up to all-time highs in the $275 range in January of 2018. But unfortunately, that bullish sentiment didn’t last long.The trade war became a reality and FDX was clearly caught in its crosshairs. Shares fell precipitously throughout the second half of 2018. I added twice during the weakness, at $200.15 and $187.06.I continued to believe that I was getting a deal. When I originally bought shares, FDX management was offering forward EPS guidance in the $12 range. That figure rose and rose during early 2018, with management offering its most bullish forward looking expectations of all-time in August of 2018, calling for full fiscal year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $15.85-$16.45.That guidance was cut in the ensuing quarter down to the $12.45-$13.40.I suppose this should have been a red flag (that’s a really wide discrepancy). But, I continued to put my faith in what I believed was the best-in-class management team. Roughly $13 per share in expected earnings still represented a fairly cheap multiple on the shares I was buying into weakness. I thought management would navigate the short-term trade issues and be able to return to growth in relatively short order.Remember, prior to the trade war, FDX was known for fantastic EPS growth. In 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, FDX posted bottom-line growth of 33%, 21%, 14%, and 24%, respectively.But, my expectations were off. It appears that I gave this company too much benefit of the doubt. FDX’s guidance continues to fall. During the most recent quarter, management called for FY 2020 EPS to come in the $10.25-$11.50 range.This means, that while the stock is down significantly (from the $275 highs in early 2018 to the $150 level where it sits today), the stock actually hasn’t gotten any cheaper. Using the bottom end of the recent guidance, the stock has actually managed to become more expensive, on a forward basis, than it was when I was buying the dip a year ago.And, as I said in the introduction, not only has FDX posted very disappointing bottom-line results, the company is no longer growing its dividend. In my portfolio, it doesn’t a lot of sense to hold onto companies that aren’t doing this. Creating a reliably increasing passive income stream is my top priority. Being that FDX’s yield is relatively low, re-investment wouldn’t generate enough compounding alone, to justify holding onto shares.Harkening back to the faith that I placed in management, I’ve been waiting for them to announce a dividend increase in recent quarters, allowing the company to maintain its current 17-year annual dividend growth streak. The company has one more chance to raise its dividend to maintain this streak. If it declares a $0.65/share dividend for the April payment, the streak will have officially ended. While there is still a chance for that to happen, I decided it wasn’t worth waiting around for. I doubt dividend growth is management’s main priority at the moment when it seem to generate sales and earnings growth, and with that in mind, I was happy to move on.The company’s margins fell dramatically during the most recent quarter and it appears that competition is really hurting FDX (operating margin came in at 3.2% compared to 6.6% a year ago). I know that management continues to be bullish, looking a year or so out, but honestly, if they were so certain of their eventual turnaround, I don’t see why they wouldn’t have given investors a small, token even, dividend increase in 2019.I invested in FDX because I viewed it as a part of a near duopoly in the global logistics space, yet falling margins like this do not signify a wide moat.To me, it appears that new competition, primarily from Amazon (AMZN) is hurting FedEx. Amazon is a relatively small part of FDX’s overall business, however, the loss of its business has proven to be a significant headwind.During the recent Q2 conference call, CEO Fred Smith said, “The loss of volume from Amazon had a larger negative impact to the second quarter than the first quarter, since the FedEx Ground contract with Amazon expire in August.”He continued on, highlighting margin headwinds, noting that Amazon, amongst other things, contributed to the problem saying, “The headwinds and expansion of six and seven-day delivery, the loss of Amazon volume, and Cyber Week shifting to the third quarter accounted for approximately 60% on the Ground margin decline year-over-year. Higher self-insurance accruals also negatively impacted Ground margins by approximately 90 basis points. Package and freight yields across our businesses have been negatively impacted due to a mix shift of lower price services, lower weight per shipment, and increasingly competitive pricing environment.CFO Alan Graf had this to say regarding the competition, “The other thing is, is that I think if you think about all the positive things we've said and that we're seeing, as we get into 2021, we will start lapping Amazon.”Specifically, regarding the margin headwinds, when Allison Landry of Credit Suisse asked a question specifically regarding management’s bullish outlook, I was disappointed with the response.Landry asked, “I know there's an element of timing of the Cyber Week, but how should we think about the cadence of these metrics in Q3 and Q4, basically just trying to understand how we can get comfortable with the margin snapping back to the double-digit level by Q4? Thank you.”Henry Maire, President and CEO of FedEx Ground, provided a response that didn’t really address the question and certainly didn’t provide peace of mind for me as a shareholder.Maire said, “The thing I would add here is that most of the costs you're seeing is the timing of peak and the six and seven-day operation being set up. We began operating seven days a week on November 3rd, and it's going to take a while for the volume and revenue and the network to catch up and cover the expense.”When reading through the conference call, I didn’t get the sense that management had a clear sense of a turnaround plan. Throughout recent quarters, I’ve worried that they were out of touch with the business and industry at large (which is a significant critique, I know). However, with so many negative changes to the guidance and results that has missed expectations over the last couple of years, what other conclusion am I supposed to arrive at?While I still believe that the established logistics companies have what it takes to compete well against individual retailers looking to cut out the middlemen and deliver their own goods due to the size and scope of their operations and the efficiencies that should come along with such volumes, if Amazon’s move to distribute its own eCommerce volumes proves to be successful, I don’t see why other mega retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) wouldn’t follow in its footsteps.This is a potentially existential threat to the logistics space as we know it. Although I’ve been a noted bull on this space, I have to admit that recent trends have turned me cautious.I sold my FDX, in part, because of these concerns. By selling when I did, I locked in an unfortunate loss. I was down ~25%, making this trade one of the worst that I've ever made. I hated locking in those losses, but a lack of confidence in management combined with the fact that the company was no longer meeting expectations from a dividend growth standpoint inspired me to make the sale. I decided that my capital was better off elsewhere and exited my FDX position at $147.32 and $147.43.I still hold a full position in United Parcel Service (UPS), but I’m also considering selling those shares as well. To me, the issues that FedEx is facing regarding margins could be a harbinger of things to come in the industry at large. Thankfully, I’m sitting on much larger gains when it comes to UPS than I was when it came to FDX, so if I were to make a move here, it would be a profitable one. I’m in the process of looking for a suitable replacement (it’s harder to find higher yielding names that I’m interested in owning right now due to high valuations in the DGI space), so don’t be surprised if you see an article from me titled, “Recent Sale: UPS” in the relatively near future.Having sold FDX, I knew I needed to put the proceeds to work.Prior to my FDX sale, I also sold Ventas (VTR) because of dividend growth issues as well. A few weeks prior to these moves, I sold my VEREIT (VER) position too (this was also a company that wasn’t providing dividend growth). I’ve discussed my year-end rebalancing a bit in recent articles. I’m making some moves to raise cash to pay down high interest student loans before the interest begins to accrue in early 2020. That process is about complete (I sold some shares to pay down debt and I re-financed part of it at a lower, much more acceptable, rate). But, these moves did put a small dent in my passive income stream and I’ve been looking to repair it.Being that FDX was bought as a high dividend growth name, I wanted to make sure that I stayed true to that segment of my portfolio with part of the proceeds. That’s where Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) comes into play.I’ve admired Brookfield Asset Management from afar for a while now. I love the disciplined, value oriented mindset that the Brookfield business was built upon. The company looks at the bigger picture with a long-term view and invests accordingly. Love is a strong word and usually best avoided in the stock market, but at the end of the day, this company’s investing principles mirror my own so closely, that it just didn’t make sense not to own shares.I also loved the Oaktree acquisition awhile back (when it comes to value minds, Howard Marks is one of my favorites). Regarding Oaktree, I was pleased with what BAM had to say about the acquisition during the recent quarterly investor presentation. Here’s a snipped from the slide show:Source: Page 3 of Q3 2019 letter to shareholdersOver the years, BAM has built itself into a widely diversified cash flow machine. The company has been generous with those cash flows with regard to shareholder returns as well. These are the types of companies that I love to own, but speaking of value, it’s rare that BAM trades at a discount and being a value investor myself, I haven’t found a compelling point to buy it at a discount.Sometimes, there are stocks that you just have to hold your nose and accumulate. Names like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) come to mind in this regard. While I hate to say this, because it goes against so many of the principles that I’ve build my investing strategy upon, I acknowledge that sometimes, it doesn’t matter all that much what you pay for a certain company’s shares because of their long-term growth rate.I bit the bullet and bought BAM at $57.81 and haven’t felt any buyer's remorse since.Sure, I wish I had bought BAM shares were when they were $37 a year ago. I didn’t, because at the time, I thought they were pricey. But, with funds from operations continuing to increase at a double digit annual rate (NAV and cash flows continue to grow at a double digit rate as well), it won’t take all that long to justify the premium that I paid.Although I think that shares are expensive, BAM management doesn’t. The company expects to see cash flows grow at a 7-9% and NAV to compound at a 15%+ rate “for years”. BAM’s management concluded that the shares were trading at a ~35% discount to fair value during the September quarter. At the time, shares were trading for $57. They’re crept up a bit since then, but assuming that their IFRS value estimate is correct, I’ll be rewarded handsomely for buying that these prices regardless of my own, more conservative, opinion.Moving forward, my plan is to slowly, but surely, build my BAM position into a full one. The shares that I bought represent a ~0.50% weighting for me. My plan is to buy shares of BAM (alongside my monthly MSFT purchases) moving forward via selective dividend re-investment until my position reaches the 1.5-2% range.Adding BAM helped to add to my high dividend growth segment, but being that BAM’s current yield is relatively low, at just 1.10%, it didn’t do a whole lot in terms of canceling out the income that I lost when selling high yielders VTR and VER. To make up for this lost income, I stayed in the Brookfield family and initiated a position in Brookfield Property REIT (BPR) at $18.49.I already owned Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), which I bought during downturns a few years ago and have treated me nicely since. I believe that Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) is a bit more cyclical and economically sensitive than BIP or BEP and I’ve been hesitant to buy into the name due to the rally that the broader markets, and the REIT space, specially, have experienced throughout 2019. However, the high yield attached to BPR at the moment was what attracted me most to the company's shares and when looking at the distribution coverage and the company’s recent dividend history, I felt as thought the yield was reasonably safe and worth the risk.BPR is a fairly new offering under the Brookfield umbrella. Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) have been around for awhile now, though the REIT subsidiary has only been trading on the NASDAQ since August of 2018. BPR offers U.S. interests a different tax structure than BPY. The REIT variant appears to make more sense for my personal portfolio, though as far as operations go, I think it’s fair to view BPY and BPR as one and the same. BPR shares can be changed for BPY units at a 1:1 ratio. And, dividends paid to BPR share holders are on the same schedule and identical in amount to the distributions paid to BPY unit holders.BPR shares have been fairly unloved by the market because of the company’s exposure to shopping malls. BPR has added significant exposure to this space, using its value oriented mindset to buy the beaten down assets. Generally speaking, I’ve been fairly content to avoid this space, even though the values are low and the yields are high. However, when looking at some of BPR’s plans for renewal in this area, I was impressed.The company is re-imagining the shopping mall experience with the addition of residential and commercial square footage, creating what are essentially self confined and sustaining commercial ecosystems. Only time will tell if this mixed-use mindset is the winning strategy in the shopping mall space. Physical retail continues to struggle at large, though who am I to argue with the minds at Brookfield?Here’s a series of images from the company’s investor day presentation showing potential plans for retail re-vitalization:Source: BPY Investor Day Presentation, Sept 2019, pages 16, 18, and 20It’s also worth mentioning that retail only makes up about 46% of BPR’s year-to-date NOI. BPR has significant office and LP holdings as well. This balanced approach helps to put my mind at ease when thinking about the shopping mall exposure here.Source: BPY Investor Day Presentation, Sept 2019, page 6I like the exposure to multi-family units that BPR provides. I also like this company’s mindset in the commercial space market. There is a lot of demand here, as noted in BAM’s recent quarterly presentation when management had this to say about office space occupancy in many of the world’s most significant urban centers:Source: Excerpt taken from Brookfield's Q3 2019 Letter to Shareholders Here’s an image showing the company’s breakdown regarding industry exposure provided at the recent Investor Day in September of 2019.As you can see in this image below, BPR is also diversified geographically as well. W.P. Carey (WPC) is my largest individual REIT holding, and its diversification across industry and geography attracted me to that name. Sometimes this diversification leads to lower multiples due to the question marks that arise when looking at so many different variables; however, in terms of generating reliable cash flows, I prefer the diversified model because I feel as if it protects me from unexpected downturns across the wider portfolio.Source: BPY Investor Day Presentation, Sept 2019, page 7I bought a ~0.75% weighted position at $18.49/share. Admittedly, this was much more of a yield play, rather than a value or growth move. BPR served a purpose for me and my year-end rebalancing scheme. This REIT hasn’t been one of my absolute favorites in the past, but being that most of my favorite names in the real estate space had a fabulous 2019, I didn’t see any compelling values and being that BPR shares offered a 7%+ yield, I was happy to take the chance with them.BPY has increased its shareholder distribution annually since initiating payment in 2013. The company has been on a $0.06/share annual increase schedule for 7 years now. If the company were to continue on this mid-single digit increase path, I’d be impressed. Obviously as the payments grow higher, this $0.015 quarterly increase represents less and less growth in terms of percentage gains; however, at the ~7% yield mark, all I’m looking for is annual growth that matches inflation and right now, another $0.015 increase would roughly double that. The next BPY/BPR distribution/dividend announcement should be in early February and I’ll definitely be watching to see if the company stays on pace.Ultimately, while I have some concerns about BPR, I like owning large, well diversified players and the company’s ~$70b AUM signify this. Furthermore, BAM recently talked about its success with regard to raising third party capital. During the trailing twelve months, the company has raised roughly $30b. Management expects its next round of funding to come in the ~$100b+ range. Needless to say, the market has confidence in Brookfield and it appears as though this company will have the fire power to take advantage of opportunities, in the real estate space, or elsewhere, should it see fit.Adding these high yielding BPR shares (alongside Broadcom’s recent 22% dividend increase) allowed me to cancel out all of the lost income from recent trades, which was a nice weight off of my shoulders.Overall, the subtractions of VER, VTR, and FDX from my portfolio, the additions of BAM and BPR, and the reduction of my Disney (DIS) stake combined with the augmentation of my Comcast (CMCSA) stake, make it stronger, in my view.My income stream is larger and my dividend growth prospects are greater. Only time will tell, but to me, this series of trades represent wins of multiple fronts and I look forward to seeing how they turn out moving into 2020 and beyond.This article was previously published for members of The Dividend Growth Club."
4314322,24223,2019-12-28T07:00:00-05:00,The horrible 2020 results are due to short-term factors.FedEx has a long and strong growth runway ahead of it.Attractive valuation during a down year is precisely when you want to buy cyclical companies like these.,"We maintain a buy rating on shares on Monmouth Real Estate (MNR), an industrial REIT with outsized exposure to FedEx (FDX). Given the fact that this REIT has a significant amount of revenue from FedEx (59.6% based on Annual Rent and 48.0% based on Square Footage) we decided that we would take a closer look at the shipping giant.Fortunately, my colleague, Dividend Sensei, on Dividend Kings, has put together an extensive research report on FedEx, a company that Dividend Kings has bought four times in the Deep Value Blue Chip portfolio.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)Besides us, FedEx has gotten several buy recommendations including:Why? Because this is a fast-growing, competently run cyclical company that's experiencing an industry downturn that has caused its valuation to collapse to the most attractive level in a decade.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)Anyone whose ever been interested in FedEx should be considering starting or adding to their position today. In fact, there are three reasons why I consider FedEx a ""good buy"" right now, and from its 16% undervaluation, it's likely to deliver strong market-beating long-term total returns.All while paying an above-average safe dividend that's likely to grow two to three times faster than the dividends of the broader market.(Source: Seeking Alpha)FedEx has been having a rough 2019, missing earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters. That's due to the cyclical nature of its business as well as a $5.9 billion investment program that it's undergoing to improve efficiency and global delivery capacity.The biggest headwind for the company has been the trade conflict which has slowed global growth including in major economies in which it operates.(Source: investor presentation)The timing of the loss of the Amazon contract (which FDX chose to terminate) as well as Cyber Week sales being pushed into December, is largely what caused adjusted operating margins to fall to 3%.Further constraining margins are investments to expand FedEx Ground to seven-day operations which management believes is a critical move to maximizing convenience and winning market share in the future.Management is confident that improving global economic conditions and its cost-cutting initiatives paying off over the next two quarters will push up operating margins about 10% by the end of May 2020.FedEx operates in 220 countries and territories, meaning that it's one of the most trade conflict-sensitive companies in America. That also means that when conditions improve even a little (such as from the phase one trade deal) it's poised for significant growth in earnings and cash flow.But the real reason to be bullish on FedEx in 2020 and beyond is its strong long-term growth runway, powered by the rise of global e-commerce.(Source: Statista)Between 2019 and 2023 Statista estimates global e-commerce sales will grow 16.7% CAGR and $3 trillion in absolute amounts. ABI Research estimates that by 2025 25% of all US retail spending will be online and by 2030 some analysts expect that to reach 30%.(Source: investor presentation)FedEx estimates that in the US e-commerce volumes will increase 90% by fiscal 2026, and it will be able to target 56% of those volumes (due to not working with Amazon).E-commerce is thus a strong secular growth catalyst and FedEx's global focus means it has stronger long-term growth potential for longer compared to UPS (UPS) who is mostly US-focused.FedEx's growth plans largely focus on replacing 159 older and less fuel-efficient jets (A-310s and MD-10s) with modern Boeing 767s and 777s that burn less fuel and have lower long-term maintenance costs. The entire MD-10 and A-310 fleet will be replaced by May 2021.The decline in capex is expected to occur in fiscal 2021 when analysts estimate FCF/share will tie 2013's record $4.14 and the FCF payout ratio will decline to a safe 63%.The company also is rapidly investing in automating its global distribution centers, allowing existing workers to be far more productive, and reducing per unit deliver costs (long-term boost to profitability).FDX's other efficiency programs include Delivery Manager which is now up and running in 59 countries. Fourteen million people have enrolled, a 66% increase from 12 months ago. By the end of fiscal 2020 (May 2020), FedEx expects that 90% of Americans will live within five miles of a FedEx retail location after it added 8,000 Dollar Generals to its convenience network in 2019. FedEx's convenience network in the US now numbers 55,000 locations.FedEx also is working with partners like AutoZone, Lowe’s, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens, Kroger's, Albertsonson's and Walmart to offer pickup and drop off locations near its customers.It's also innovating with the iBot technology which FedEx developed with Dean Kamden (the famous inventor) and which is designed to eventually allow retailers to make last-mile deliveries at significantly lower costs.(Source: FedEx)iBot is designed to allow cheap same-day delivery service in 1,900 cities in 32 countries. FedEx Ground is currently 25% faster than UPS and the company wants to be the fastest and most cost-effective solution for its global customers as well.(Source: investor presentation)FedEx's excellent long-term focus on quality and speedy service is why it has been steadily gaining market share from UPS for the past 20 years.(Source: investor presentation)FDX has also been steadily winning market share in US trucking deliveries and is now the industry giant. We don't care about short-term hiccups, but management's long-term track record in delivering good execution and steady market share and fundamental growth.FedEx also is working on improving the safety and efficiency of its vehicles including through:Finally, FedEx is one of the founders of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance which plans to explore using blockchain technology to improve shipping information transparency, efficiency, and convenience.FedEx's overall business model remains appealing. Globally UPS, FedEx, and DHS dominate the industry with UPS and FedEx being the kings of US delivery.DHL tried to become the third major player in the US but after 10 years of trying, and $1 billion in losses in 2007, it gave up after concluding that economies of scale would simply take too long to achieve profitability soon or with sufficient returns on invested capital to make the effort worthwhile.(Source: Ycharts)8% is considered a good return on invested capital for most corporations and FDX's 10-year median ROIC is about 10%. This gives me confidence that management's capital allocation decisions, including the $5.9 billion they are investing in capacity expansion and efficiency, will work out over time.Fred Smith is the founder of FedEx and remains chairman, president, and CEO. How good is Fred Smith? Forbes has named him one of the “100 Greatest Living Business Minds,” and he been named a top CEO by Barron’s and Chief Executive magazines.Raj Subramaniam is the COO in charge of daily operations and executing on the growth plan, and he took over that job in March 2019. He's a 27-year FedEx veteran in which he served various functions across various geographic regions.The CFO Alan Graf has been in his role for 21 years, but with FedEx for 39. He's the one that's helped FDX deliver 17 consecutive years of dividend growth in a cycle and capital intensive industry. As long as FedEx raises its quarterly dividend by any amount over the next two quarters it will retain its dividend challenger status and remain on track to become a dividend aristocrat in 2028.(Source: investor presentation)Basically, the highly capital intensive nature of this business and strong network effects mean that FedEx and UPS have strong business models where their above-average profitability can likely be maintained even in the face of future challengers.You don't have to just take my word for it. Here's Morningstar's Mathew Young explaining why Morningstar has a narrow moat positive outlook rating on FedEx.A perfect example of FDX's network effect is that 97% of US sales come from customers that use at least two of its three services, and 80% from companies that use all three.(Source: FDX)What would it take to compete with FedEx? Tens of billions of dollars and decades in order to recreate its logistics infrastructure with zero guarantees that any challenger would generate significant profitability in the future.(Source: FDX)That infrastructure delivers 15 million packages per day and links together companies representing 99% of the world's GDP via 5,000 operating facilities.The bottom line is that FedEx is a proven pioneer in its industry. It literally invented Express delivery and it continues to invest in innovation and efficiency to maximize its network effects.(Source: FDX)We have confidence that management will be able to adapt and overcome the various headwinds it's facing now and will surely face in the future. All with the goal of achieving 10% to 15% CAGR growth in earnings, cash flow and ultimately dividends.That's 100% to 200% faster growth than most companies in the S&P 500, making FedEx a fast-growing dividend growth name that's likely capable of delivering very attractive returns from its current 16% discount to fair value.The way we value a company is based on either the historical valuations real investors risking real money have paid for fundamentals or using Chuck Carnevale/Ben Graham/Peter Lynch rules of thumb for companies growing slower than they have in the past.FDX Growth ProfileThe future always is uncertain, which is why it's useful to create a realistic growth range that includes several economic/industry cycles.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)FedEx's slowest long-term growth rate was 7% over the past 12 years. We consider the Reuters -2% CAGR growth estimate to be an outlier, given that the company's plan for returning to strong growth in the future appear reasonable and sound.(Source: Ycharts)At the upper end of the growth range is Ychart's long-term consensus of 12%. While long-term forecasts can be volatile, FDX's has remained above 10% even with all its recent trade/Amazon troubles.Since FDX's historical growth rate is 8.3% CAGR the 7% to 12% growth range means that historical multiples are appropriate for estimating fair value.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research, Reuters', Gurufocus, Yieldchart)The true value of any company is likely to lie within the range of its individual metric fair values. We use the average of all non-outlier company appropriate fair value estimates to generate a reasonable estimate of what a company's fundamentals are worth in any given year.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)In the case of FedEx, fiscal 2020 is going to be a weak year, which is hardly new for the company. During the Great Recession, earnings fell 44% and the far milder trade conflict-induced slowdown is expected to cause a 30% decline in operating earnings this year.Cash flows are expected to fall far less than that, and in fiscal 2021 (starts in May) and 2022 double-digit growth is expected to resume.Once we have a reasonable fair value estimate we then apply the appropriate margin of safety for a company based on its quality score.FedEx is 16% undervalued, so a good buy today. In a potential 2020 pullback or correction, it could become a strong buy or very strong buy boosting annual return potential by 2% to 4% CAGR.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)If FedEx grows at the low end of its growth range and recovers to a long-term PE of 16, then it could deliver 19% CAGR total returns through May 2024.Contrast that with the 2% to 7% CAGR that most asset managers expect from the S&P 500 in the coming years, or the 4% to 6% CAGR that the Gordon Dividend Growth model estimates for the broader market.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)At the upper end of its return potential range, a PE of 18 and 12% growth could deliver nearly 30% CAGR returns, or nearly quadruple your investment over the next five years.(Sources: F.A.S.T Graphs, FactSet Research)The medium-term consensus forecast is created using consensus estimates through May 2022 and applying a lower than historically normal 15.8 PE, which shows FDX is capable of about 70% total returns through May 2022.FedEx may not be a particularly high-yielding stock but its long-term growth rate is expected to be about double the historical 5% to 7% of the S&P 500. Combine that with rapid dividend growth (17.4% CAGR since 2003) and you can see how buying FDX at the best valuation in a decade can make for an attractive long-term investment.Of course, the reason we demand a margin of safety from nearly all companies is that each has a risk profile that could potentially break the investment thesis.The biggest fundamental risk for FedEx is that its multi-year $5.9 billion investment plan won't generate the expected returns on investment.The TNT Express acquisition, for which FDX paid $4.8 billion in 2016, hasn't been going as smoothly as expected. The amount of money required to upgrade the logistics base for TNT has proved greater than expected. However, FDX did pay a very good price for the company by waiting for the Euro to weaken in 2015 before making its final offer.Part of the reason FDX is struggling is that cost cutting in a weak EU economy while facing a highly-unionized TNT labor force is something that it hasn't dealt with before.M&A is tricky to pull off, but management's overall capital allocation track record is above average. FDX has done 25 acquisitions since 1984 with TNT merely being one of the largest.Fast e-commerce growth also can be a headache if execution slips.Management will need to make sure its logistics network can handle the rapid growth in package volume if it's to continue winning or merely retaining market share relative to its major rivals.Fundamentally, FedEx's sales, earnings, and cash flow growth always will be closely tied to the health of the US and global economies. With the TNT acquisition, Europe and Asia will become increasing growth drivers, meaning FDX's results could become more cyclical than in the past.Finally, we can't ignore the biggest long-term challenger to FedEx, Amazon (AMZN).In the US Morgan Stanley expects Amazon's rapidly-expanding delivery service to deliver more packages than either UPS or FDX by 2022 (5 and 3.4 billion packages in the US, respectively).Remember how expensive it would be to compete with FDX or UPS? Well for most companies, that's true. But Amazon has a rich history of investing billions over many years into operations that aren't expected to generate significant profits except over the very long term.Amazon is now expected to deliver 3.5 billion packages in the US in 2019, courtesy of 150 U.S. delivery stations and 90,000 delivery-focused employees.AWS and advertising revenue that Piper Jaffray estimates have 75% operating margins is how Amazon is able to invest in low margin businesses like retail and delivery to increase the stickiness of its ecosystem. In Q3 2019, Amazon Web Services generated $3.6 billion in operating profit that Jeff Bezos can throw at a fast ramp-up of its in-house delivery operations.If there's any company in the world that could challenge FedEx not just in the US market but overseas, it's Amazon, whose CEO Jeff Bezos famously said: ""Your margin is our opportunity.""In terms of valuation risk, it's minimal, given that FDX's lowest ever PE ratio was 10.1 in March 2009. That's just 14% lower than it is now, and the probability of another Great Recession happening anytime soon is very low.But just because FedEx's valuation risk is low doesn't mean it can't suffer short-term volatility.FDX Peak Declines Since 1986(Source: Portfolio Visualizer) portfolio 1 = FDXFDX is currently in its fourth-worst bear market ever, which began from a peak stock price of $263 and 18.3 PE. In other words, FDX's current bear market didn't begin when it was wildly overpriced, but is a result of its latest downturn in fundamentals. That downturn is likely temporary and will end within a quarter or two.But in the future long term, FedEx shareholders have to remember that this can be a highly volatile stock, which has suffered seven bear markets in the last 33 years (vs S&P 500's four).We don't point out this historical volatility to scare anyone from owning FDX or any stock for that matter, merely to highlight the importance of owning any of my recommendations as part of a diversified and properly risk-managed portfolio.These are the risk guidelines we use for the Dividend King portfolios and we created them after consulting with colleagues who collectively have over 150 years of experience in asset management.The essence of risk management is to avoid costly mistakes, the biggest of which is terrible market timing created by psychological landmines like panic selling.(Source: Dulbar, Lance Roberts)Dulbar has been studying how behavioral finance effects long-term investing returns since 1994 and the results back up other research by JPMorgan Asset Management.(Source: Dulbar)6% CAGR underperformance over 30 years is what market timing gets you.Note that a 60/40 stock/bond balanced portfolio would have delivered 8.6% CAGR over the last 30 years, 6.0% after inflation.

Rather it's about building a SWAN portfolio that will allow you to avoid costly mistakes that can sink your financial goals.We understand why investors might be skeptical of FedEx after so many earnings misses and guidance cuts. However, the best time to buy cyclical companies like this is precisely when the market hates them most and they are trading at the best valuations in a decade.FedEx is a well-managed company with a strong business model. Yes, they face risks, as do all companies. However, companies don't succeed and grow earnings, cash flow and dividends due to nothing going wrong, but despite something constantly going wrong.Long-term investors profit from remembering that the market is seldom efficient in the short term but always efficient over the long term.FedEx's growth runway remains strong and analysts agree that management's 10% to 15% CAGR long-term growth guidance is reasonable, courtesy of a decades-long growth runway in global e-commerce.As part of a well-diversified and risk-managed portfolio, FedEx is likely to deliver excellent long-term income growth and total returns from its current 16% undervaluation.It's a ""good buy"" today and is likely to deliver double-digit long-term returns that should put the broader market to shame in the coming years.Author's note: Brad Thomas is a Wall Street writer, which means he's not always right with his predictions or recommendations.

4313452,31441,2019-12-19T20:16:46-05:00,"FDX reported a 3% decline in revenue, while costs grew.Margins cratered as the company spent more to expand FedEx Ground to seven days.FedEx delivered the truth about poor economic conditions.Waning business confidence could stymie FDX long term. Sell the stock.","Source: Barron'sFedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported revenue of $17.3 billion, Non-GAAP EPS of $2.51 and GAAP EPS of $2.13. The company missed on Non-GAAP EPS, GAAP EPS and revenue. The stock is down double digits post-earnings. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.The U.S. economy has melted up since the Financial Crisis of 2008. Much of that growth has been stimulus-induced. What happens when policymakers remove the punch bowl? We may have caught a glimpse of it last quarter. Global trade declined, which hurt shipments. A knock-on effect of trade tensions with China was that global trade also declined in Europe, hurting FedEx's international operations.China and the U.S. reached a Phase 1 trade deal last week. China will suspend tariffs on certain U.S. goods that were expected to take effect the middle of this month. Industrial production rose in November, helped by the end of the strike at General Motors (GM); however, it has been anemic for most of the year. The question remains, ""Will business confidence become strong enough to drive purchases of equipment and spur industrial activity?"" Thawing trade tensions with China can't hurt. However, I believe the economy has peaked until I see evidence to the contrary.An anemic economy has created headwinds for FedEx. Heading into the quarter its revenue growth was flat. It actually fell 3% this quarter. FedEx Express revenue fell 5% Y/Y due the loss of a large customer and macroeconomic headwinds. FedEx Ground revenue increased 3%, while FedEx Freight revenue fell 4%%. I expected revenue from FedExpress to fall. If business activity is in decline, then there may be less need to ship sensitive documents. Secondly, if executives do not have confidence in the future, then they may want to wring out costs within their own businesses. FedExpress, which is a premium service, could be the first services companies cut if they want to reduce costs.The revenue decline was problematic because FedEx's costs are still rising. Again, its infrastructure is built to support top line growth. It may not be that easy to cut costs on dime. Secondly, it is facing competitive pressures from UPS (UPS) and Amazon (AMZN). It may have to keep investing in its infrastructure or cede the customer service battle to competitors. Margins cratered this quarter.Operating income was $554 million, down over 50% Y/Y. Operating income margin was 3.3%, down about 370 basis points versus the year earlier period. On a segment basis, operating income at FedEx Express and FedEx Ground were hard hit, falling 63% and 42%, respectively.I was surprised by the sharp decline in margins at FedEx Ground. The company is expanding FedEx Ground to six and seven-day delivery, yet its revenue has not caught up with the rising costs:FedEx created a lane for itself by selling next day distribution services and the certainty that a package would be delivered. Now, it appears to be attempting to create demand for seven-day delivery. I find it difficult to believe that business is that ebullient that people need packages delivered on Sunday. Secondly, FedEx appears to expanding these new services as the economy has likely peaked. This appears to be the perfect storm in my opinion - rising costs amid waning demand and rising competition.Free falling margins were driven by the 3% decline in revenue and 1% increase in costs. FedEx's two largest costs were salaries (36% of revenue) and purchased transportation (24% of revenue). The railroads are laying off people in order to protect margins. FedEx was adamant the economy was strong enough that it did not have to resort to layoffs in order to grow earnings. Investors should not expect deep cost cuts at FedEx anytime soon.I believe the economy would have become stagnant even if there had not been a trade war with China. Bailouts to big business and policies designed to spur business fixed investment may have likely run their course. FedEx could show improvement next quarter, but over the long term, I expect economic forces to contract. That does not bode well for the transportation sector. Investors should brace themselves for more declines and revenue and margins at FedEx.Thawing trade tensions could spur FedEx in the short term. Long term, I expect a lack of business confidence to stymie the company. FDX is down over 5% Y/Y and will likely fall further. Sell the stock."
4312825,86786,2019-12-16T19:44:46-05:00,"FedEx (FDX) reports earnings Tuesday, and I have recommended a short position for earnings traders.Sentiment is down overall, despite FDX filling its recent area gap.All things being equal, FDX’s earnings should appear weaker year-over-year.","At the start of December, I published my top five earnings plays for the month:I called three out of four correctly, which is especially difficult when calling for short trades (it is more common for a stock to rise on earnings). The remaining trade is FedEx (FDX), which reports Tuesday:I want to take a deeper look at FDX, as my prediction from the beginning of the month is already a couple weeks stale, and FDX has rallied to close the area gap on December 3. This can mean one of two things: Either FDX is showing pre-earnings drift indicative of strong earnings or FDX is simple responding to the gap and now sits at a great entry point for a short trade:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)SentimentIt often helps to look at management sentiment before earnings. Management sentiment, via earnings calls, can help predict the coming quarter’s returns. I ran a lexical analysis on management sentiment over the last few years’ of FDX’s earnings reports.I found FDX’s management sentiment to be 73% lower than average. Nevertheless, sentiment is up over 30% quarter-to-quarter, which is expected as per mean reversion (last quarter, the stock was crushed on earnings). Still, FDX’s sentiment is 84% lower year-over-year.You can see this story in the chart:(Source: Stockcharts)The implication of sentiment for December’s earnings is somewhat difficult to pin. First, sentiment is down overall, implying underperformance. Second, sentiment is rising, implying excess returns. In general, these two things are bullish because large deviations in sentiment reverse, as per the property of mean reversion.However, this is regarding sentiment only and thus is better for predicting FDX’s direction in early 2020 than it is for predicting FDX’s reaction to its earnings report. I remain bearish on FDX because of its fundamental and technical patterns.For example, a company with a falling growth/asset ratio tends to underperform. FedEx has been growing its assets – almost doubling them – over the last four years. Yet, the numerator of this ratio – growth – has been declining over the last four years, and this trend is likely to continue into 2020:(Source: Macrotrends)Macro and Other FactorsIn addition, macro factors, such as the slowdown in Europe’s growth, uncertainty regarding Brexit, and a bottoming-out Chinese industrial sector, should continue to be seen in FDX’s earnings. The trade war being alleviated is probably already priced into the stock, helping explain the area gap filling. A US-Sino trade deal will not change the fact that we are seeing declining global and Chinese PMI in spite of any tariffs, and thus should not be seen as a catalyst for alleviating the declining growth in FedEx’s business.Other factors, such as the loss of FedEx’s contract with Amazon will hurt its bottom line in the short term (the company has stated that it has already replaced the traffic attributed to the Amazon contract in a more cost-effective way, a bullish factor for 2020 but is unlikely to be palpable in this quarter’s earnings report).FedEx’s peak season is also four days shorter this year. Hence all things being equal, FDX’s earnings should appear weaker year-over-year. In addition, FedEx’s most profitable services during peak season – freight and express services – should see decreased demand this year due to a weaker trade and manufacturing environment, and this should be reflected, again, in year-over-year weakness.While I might walk back my prediction were FDX oversold, the gap filling brings FDX to a good price for a short position; in fact, I think any price over $157.50 is likely to lead to profit-taking on good earnings, thus bringing FDX down immediately on earnings (but not necessarily creating a breakaway gap; we might see another area gap, in fact). Overall, this risk/reward and the probability are on the side of FDX from a seasonal perspective, and this has worsened over the past four-year election cycle:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)While the price action currently appears bullish, the smart money is acting much more conservatively. Both the dumb money and smart money are buying this rally, but the smart money is refusing to buy dips, unlike the dumb money. This usually shows that the smart money is expecting a pullback and will be taking profit once the upward momentum stops.Earnings momentum tends to precede stock price momentum. The 90% decline in EPS over the past year is not a fluke but part of this momentum that has been downward over the past four years. EBITDA has peaked, while the company continues to grow its assets:(Source: Macrotrends)OverallIf anything, FDX is overpriced relative to earnings, creating a convex payoff curve for short trades over earnings.I would suggest FDX holders who wish to hold through earnings to at least hedge. As a hedge, I would suggest holding long puts over earnings and engaging in stock repair after earnings, should FDX fall to create an area gap. Stock repair is simply buying at-the-money calls (one call per lot of stock) and selling out-of-the-money calls (two calls per lot of stock), allowing for a quick recoup of gains after a pullback.Let me know if you have any questions about this FDX over earnings or this particular hedge in the comments section below."
4311982,20715,2019-12-11T15:31:57-05:00,FedEx is set to report fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday.Earnings are expected to decline for the quarter and that would mark four straight quarters of earnings declines if it holds true.The stock has been trending lower for almost two years now with a trend line connecting the highs from the last eight months.Analysts have become more pessimistic toward the stock in the last three months.,"FedEx (FDX) is set to release its latest earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. These results are for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Analysts expect the company to earn $2.81 per share for the quarter. FedEx earned $4.03 in the second quarter of 2019. The consensus estimate for revenue is at $17.61 billion.The expected decline in earnings isn't new as FedEx has seen earnings decline in three straight quarters. The first quarter results were down 12% from the previous year and analysts expect earnings for 2020 to decline by 22% overall. Revenue was flat in the second quarter and it is expected to be flat for the year.The drop in earnings and the lack of growth for the company have really come in to play in the last year. In the previous three years earnings had grown at a rate of 16% per year while revenue had increased at a rate of 10% per year.I wrote about FedEx in September ahead of its first quarter earnings report and I noted some different figures for the management efficiency measurements.""Looking at some other fundamental indicators for FedEx, I get some differing figures from the Wall Street Journal and Investor's Business Daily. The Journal has the return on equity at 2.9% while IBD has it at 22.2%. The Journal's figure would be considered lower than the average stock while IBD's would be slightly above average.The Journal has the profit margin at 0.77% as does Yahoo Finance. IBD has the profit margin at 7.6%. Both figures are below average compared to all other stocks.""IBD still shows a return on equity of 22.2% and a profit margin of 7.6% and the Journal still has those figures at 2.9% and 0.77%.In addition to declining earnings, FedEx has cited the trade war as an issue that is hurting its business and many investors continue to look at a decline in business from Amazon (AMZN) as an issue. FedEx ended its ground-delivery contract with Amazon back at the end of August. At the time of the announcement, FedEx said less than 1.3% of revenue could be attributed to Amazon.Regardless of the reasons, FedEx investors are looking for some positive news that can move the stock higher.If we look at the weekly chart for FedEx we see that the stock peak coincided with what I view as the start of the trade war. At the end of January 2018, President Trump announced ""safeguard tariffs"" on solar panels and washing machines and that was the first official move in the trade war. China retaliated shortly thereafter and now it has stretched to almost two years.While the peak came in January 2018, I am more concerned about the trend line that connects the highs since April. The high in September came just ahead of the first quarter earnings reports and my cautious stance turned out to be warranted. The stock fell from the $175 area to below $140 in a three-week span.We see the 52-week moving average looming as potential resistance just above the trend line and that is yet another concern.The weekly oscillators are in the middle of their ranges, but that's where they were in September as well. The stock hasn't spiked ahead of this earnings report, so there is a different pattern in the RSI and the stochastic readings.The one potential positive on the chart is how there seems to be so much downside momentum that if the stock could break above the trend line, we could see a big rally. That's a big if though.Looking back at my September article, there were 27 analysts covering the stock at that time with 19 ""buy"" ratings, seven ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. Flash forward to today and we see 14 ""buy"" ratings, 13 ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. In terms of the overall buy percentage, analysts have shifted considerably. The percentage was at 70.4% in September and is at 50% now. The average buy percentage is in the 65% to 75% range.The short interest ratio is at 1.8 currently. The number of shares sold short fell from 5.95 million to 4.88 million from the mid-November report to the end of November report. The ratio was at 2.4 back in September and it is surprising to see the ratio drop given the trend in the stock. The ratio is below average and is reflective of optimism.The put/call ratio is at 1.05 currently and that is slightly below where the indicator was in September (1.16). I noted in the September article that the put/call ratio had been below 1.0 before the two previous earnings reports. One thing that jumped out about the current option open interest was that both puts and calls have higher totals. There are 96,360 puts open and 91,729 calls open.Obviously the biggest shift in sentiment came from the analysts' ratings and unfortunately this is the sentiment indicator that doesn't usually change on a dime. If there is a high short interest ratio on a stock and the stock breaks through a resistance level, short sellers can add buying pressure to the rally when they try to cover.I remain neutral on FedEx for now. There are just too many negatives to overlook at this time. The declining earnings and stagnant revenues are one issue and the downward trend in the stock is another one. It is encouraging to see somewhat of a shift in the sentiment, but I don't think it is enough to change the tide at this point.If you are a value investor, the P/E ratio being in the 10 range has to be somewhat appealing, but I don't know if it is worth the risk at this time. If you own the stock, I think you will have to exercise patience and have a long investment horizon. I don't see the stock moving sharply higher anytime soon. There are too many layers of technical resistance for the stock to fight through.If your investment horizon is shorter, I can see the stock jumping another 10% to 15% if it is able to break through the trend line and the 52-week moving average. Back in early 2016 the stock was trading below the 52-week moving average and it was an earnings report that moved the stock above the trend line, unfortunately the stock moved back down a little after the spike. Eventually the stock would rally almost 40% in the second half of 2016.I don't see the stock climbing 40% in the next six to nine months. I think the stock could remain in the $140 to $175 range for the next few quarters. If you can get in down at the bottom of the range and sell at the top of the range, that isn't a bad return-25% is nothing to sneeze at. However, a break below the $140 level would likely take the stock back down to its 2016 low, down in the $115 range."
4312847,32001,2019-12-17T01:35:47-05:00,"FedEx the transport giant reports their fiscal Q2 '20 financial results after the bell on Tuesday, December 17th, with consensus Wall Street estimates being $2.76 in earnings per share (EPS) on $17.58 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year declines of 32% and 1% respectively.The decline in revenue estimates from early 2018 for fiscal 2020, has been less than 3% versus the 40% decline in the fiscal 2020 EPS estimate.While the trade deals impact FedEx Express - 52% of revenue but operating income has fallen to just 29% of FedEx's total operating income as of Q1 '20, FedEx Ground and the encroachment by Amazon is a little worrisome.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) the transport giant reports their fiscal Q2 '20 financial results after the bell on Tuesday, December 17th, with consensus Wall Street estimates being $2.76 in earnings per share (EPS) on $17.58 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year declines of 32% and 1% respectively.The good news is that - starting with the November '19 earnings release, FedEx begins to lap the awful compares of the last 4 quarters.The peak in FDX's stock occurred in late January, early February '18 when the stock peaked at $274 per share but since then the China trade and tariffs issue, the supply-chain rerouting that has gripped industrial America, the slowdown in Europe on trade and Brexit issues, and the growing competition to FedEx Ground from the Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN) trucks and one-day delivery has taken a significant toll on the stock. That doesn't even include the hack of FedEx's biggest European acquisition, TNT, which impacted that business and its integration into FedEx as a whole. (The TNT integration was scheduled to take 12 quarters or 3 years, so it will be interesting to hear where Fred Smith (CEO) and Alan Graf (CFO) think that stands today. According to sell-side comments a few quarters ago, the integration should be in the 9th or 10th quarter.)As readers can see, the fiscal 2020, and 2021 EPS estimates peaked in early 2018, a few months after the stock peak and have fallen dramatically since. Have the EPS estimates bottomed? There is usually a lag between the stock price peak or trough and the trend in estimates, so be patient, but with the trade deal and Brexit scheduled for January 31, 2020, investors and CEOs have more clarity on trade and Brexit rules and thus there should be some pickup in international trade.To give readers and investors an idea of the operating leverage in FDX, revenue estimates haven't declined nearly as much as EPS estimates, which is typical with businesses with high fixed costs.The decline in revenue estimates from early 2018 for fiscal 2020, has been less than 3% versus the 40% decline in the fiscal 2020 EPS estimate.The obvious issues like the China tariff tiff and the never-ending Brexit debate are now either behind us in the form of Phase One of the China Trade deal AND the USMCA agreed to last week, or will soon be settled as Boris Johnson has set a firm date of January 31. 2020 for Brexit to happen.While the trade deals impact FedEx Express - 52% of revenue but operating income has fallen to just 29% of FedEx's total operating income as of Q1 '20, FedEx Ground and the encroachment by Amazon is a little worrisome. Fred Smith has described the worry as ""fantastical"" years ago, but Amazon with 1-day delivery seems to have upped the ante and pressure on Ground, which was 30% of total FedEx revenue as of Q1 '20 but 66% of operating income. (FedEx took a charge for TNT integration, which I assume would have been flushed through Express, hence the drop in Express operating income in Q1 '20.)The other issue for FedEx is free cash flow generation: FedEx's cash flow and free cash flow is tracked every quarter on the valuation spreadsheet (acquisitions are INCLUDED in capex for free cash flow calculation purposes) and 9 of the last 12 quarters for FedEx has been free cash flow negative on a trailing 4-quarter basis. Q1 '20 which was the quarter ended Aug '19 saw a free cash flow deficit of $850 million, which is sizable, although to be evenhanded with FedEx, the first fiscal quarter of every year is typically free cash negative.FedEx has moved back over its 200-day moving average which is a key level for chart watchers. Let's see if ""post earnings"" the stock can stay above the 200-day and 50-week moving average. FedEx traded as low as the high $140s after December 2018's earnings release, so a trade below $145 wouldn't want to be seen by those who are long the stock.After falling almost 50% from its January '18 highs, FedEx is trying to steady the ship and the trade deals, (China and USMCA) and ultimately Brexit should provide substantial clarity to an international trade environment that was murky at best and completely unnavigable at worst. (How as a CEO do you plan for the next 1-year or 3-year capex when you have no idea what the trade rules or regs will look like ?)The newer problem for FedEx is now what about the domestic US Ground business and will that be the albatross that slows the Ground giant?I was out for dinner last week at a restaurant in the western suburbs of Chicago talking to an old trucker guy (older than me, owned a small trucking company his whole life) and he made the point that Amazon would not have gotten into the business without the goal of dominating it eventually.However, reading the August '19's quarterly conference call notes, Fred Smith gave the metrics on the Ground and package business and it sounded like FedEx was viewing Ground as a continuing opportunity rather than a threat. Hearing about businesses like Uber Freight (NYSE:UBER) and other startups as I see more and more Amazon Prime trucks rolling around Chicago and the 'burbs, has me nervous for sure.Clients have less than a 1% position in FedEx that's been built over the last year, which includes a $36 cost basis position from March of 2000. More FedEx will be added here - maybe even a little before the Tuesday's results - since I think Fred Smith and Alan Graf are one of the best management teams in the Transportation sector.FedEx is trading at less than 1x revenue, 8x cash flow and 14x 2020's current estimate of $12.What will be watched after the report (and assume it will be bad news, but the comparisons get far easier in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021) will be the trend and magnitude of EPS and revenue revisions, what Fred Smith and Alan Graf might say about the signing of the trade deals and how fast some of this traffic can recover, and what free cash flow guidance might look like.Readers should assume the numbers will continue to be bad for the next two quarters.Thanks for reading.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4312945,31441,2019-12-17T12:57:38-05:00,FDX reports quarterly earnings Tuesday.Revenue has been negatively impacted by weak global trade.Industrial production is also in decline. Businesses may have less confidence in the future.Lack of business confidence is likely hurting spending. It could stymie FDX this quarter.FDX remains a sell.,"Source: CNBCFedEx (FDX) reports quarterly earnings December 17th. Analysts expect revenue of $17.59 billion and EPS of $2.79. The revenue estimate implies a 1% decline Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.The U.S. economy has grown steadily since the Financial Crisis. I do not believe the economy can grow in perpetuity; economic forces are weaker than realized. An incessant melt up in financial markets has masked that weakness, in my opinion. FedEx is highly-dependent upon economic growth. Its shipping services are almost a proxy for the strength of industrial businesses and global trade. Last quarter management lamented how the decline in global trade was hurting its operations:The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade volume to rise 1.2% in 2019. It expects trade volume to grow by 2.6% in 2020, down from its previous forecast of 3.0%. Still, rising trade volume should help FedEx grow revenue next year. The question remains, is any revenue growth sustainable?China and the U.S. reached a Phase 1 trade deal last week. China will suspend tariffs on certain U.S. goods that were expected to take effect the middle of this month. Meanwhile, U.S. industrial production fell 0.8% in October, its steepest decline in 17 months. Several businesses are uncertain about the future and have delayed spending because of it. Whether or not business optimism returns quickly could determine if FedEx's top line growth rebounds.Last quarter the company generated $17.1 billion in revenue, flat Y/Y. FedEx Ground and FedEx Express were disaffected by the loss of a large customer. In August the company did not renew its ground shipping contract with Amazon (AMZN), which is building out its own delivery infrastructure and could become a FedEx competitor. Revenue from FedEx Ground and FedEx Express rose 8% and 3%, respectively. FedEx Freight revenue fell 3% due to decreased average daily shipments, slightly offset by higher revenue per shipment.The global slowdown also negatively impacted FedEx's margins. FedEx is likely having to work harder in order to maintain its top line. Operating income of $977 million was down by high single-digits.Operating income margin was 5.7% versus 6.3% in the year earlier period. The 60 basis point decline caused operating income to decline despite flat revenue growth. Operating Income at FedEx Express fell 27% Y/Y. Market chatter previously implied FedEx may have been slashing prices to fill planes. Last month's performance did not do much to dispel the chatter. If the economy is stagnant then one would expect revenue or margins at FedEx Express would get hit the hardest. It is a premium service that businesses could scale back in order to cut costs. Operating income at FedEx Ground fell 5%; operating income at FedEx Freight rose by double-digits, despite the decline in revenue.Total operating expenses for the company rose 1% Y/Y. Salaries and employee benefits fell 3% due to lower variable incentive compensation. Salaries were FedEx's largest expense item at 36% of total revenue. Other expenses rose and could be more difficult to contain going forward. A 1% rise in total expenses would normally sound stellar, except that revenue did not grow. The problem appears to be a lack of revenue growth instead of an inability to contain costs.Competitive pressures may force FedEx to work harder in order to maintain its top line. This implies that costs could continue to grow more than revenue. The company's cost infrastructure appears built to support top line growth. If that growth doesn't materialize then the fall out will likely be declining margins and declining operating income.A lack of business confidence could stymie FDX this quarter. The stock is up 5% Y/Y, but will likely fall amid a global economy that may have peaked. Sell FDX."
4305267,105256,2019-11-10T21:30:38-05:00,"Let's be careful this week. The rally is intact, but we could see some consolidation this week.I list 5 areas that could offer an opportunity for the market to stumble a bit.I want to pay more attention to other cyclicals than tech, like the Transports and Industrials.We have some interesting earnings reports, IPO lockup expirations this week. The key for this week is not to just buy a name you like, but wait for a significant move to justify going long.","Have you heard this one? Trees don't grow to the skies and neither do stocks. The S&P has run to 3093, a stone's throw from my 2019 high of 3150. Look, I am not the boss of the S&P index, maybe we finish 2019 at 3300! What I can promise you is that the run doesn't go straight up with a jot or a tittle to the downside. It better not because there will be hell to pay on the other side of that jump. So after a really good run last week, this is the week that may be the pause that refreshes. Here's why:Trump to Speak at Economic Club of New York On Tuesday, Trump will deliver remarks at the Economic Club of New York with market participants hoping for more clarity on a planned ""phase one"" deal. Trump on Friday said he has not agreed to rollbacks of U.S. tariffs sought by China. It sparked fresh doubts about when the 16-month trade war that has slowed global growth might end. Officials from both countries had said China and the U.S. had agreed to roll back tariffs on each other's goods in a ""phase one"" trade deal. Trump could say something that the market doesn't want to hear about that or perhaps talk up tariffs on European cars. The news that Trump didn't agree to the roll-back didn't harm the Melt-up, all 3 main indexes closed in the black on Friday. Trump might not pull punches on Tuesday and that could hurt the rally. Just to put a finer point on it, Juncker, the President of the EU, was the one to announce that the US agreed not to put tariffs on their cars. The market loved this news, but no one in the administration concurred on that notion.Powell testimony - Investors will hear directly from Jay Powell on the outlook of the economy, inflation and monetary policy when he testifies before the congressional Joint Economic Committee Wednesday and the House Budget Committee on Thursday. He is expected to reiterate that plans for further easing are now on hold after the Fed cut rates last month for the third time in as many meetings. What happens if he starts talking about what the Fed might do if inflation spikes? Recently, Powell has played the stock market like a fiddle, so the reaction could be very harsh if he goes back to the old Powell.U.S. economic data - An update of U.S. economic data at a time when market participants are leaning toward the diminished impact of the trade conflict on the outlook for growth. Wednesday brings October's Consumer Price Index. Core year-on-year CPI is expected at 2.4% and headline at 1.7%. The Fed's favorite measure of core personal consumption expenditures (the PCE indicator) is running around 1.6% - hovering mostly below the 2% target for about a decade. On Friday, October retail sales and industrial production data will shed light on whether the consumer can continue to drive growth. What happens if a more negative outlook interferes with an optimistic assumption of the ""King Consumer"" powering the economy? Or more likely the decent numbers have already been discounted and the market is looking for stronger performance? What happens if we finally get a spike in the PCE? Why now after 10 years? Well, Powell mentioned that they would keep interest rates low even in the face of a rising inflation rate just to make sure inflation comes back to a comfortable rate? Cynical NYer that I am, I went right to the notion of what does Powell see that we don't see? Maybe he's got some early word on inflation? Sure, the market is reassured that the Fed won't jump until it sees ""the whites of the eyes"" of the inflation monster but to actually see a PCE approach 2% will roil the markets.Global growth update - Several countries from Germany to Japan will release third-quarter growth data in coming days. Figures from Germany on Thursday will likely show that the Eurozone’s largest economy bottomed in the third quarter. In the U.K., data on Monday is expected to show that the economy narrowly avoided a recession after a 0.2% contraction in the previous quarter. But a high degree of economic uncertainty looks set to persist, prompting Bank of England to indicate last week that it's ready to cut rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Japan is to release third-quarter GDP figures on Thursday, amid forecasts for a slight slowdown from the previous quarter, though I recall recent more positive numbers. Again, the market will not appreciate disappointing growth numbers at the height it is at right now.The 10-year has run up strongly from 1.4% to 1.7% in what seems like days. The banks have run up on a strengthening of the bond, on the idea that the interest rate rising means the NIM, the Net Interest Margin, is improving, and that the economy is stronger than expected. Perhaps most of the rise of share prices in banks is the excellent earnings reports of the banks. That said, a retreat in the 10-year interest rates if rapid enough could start a retreat in the banks, which are a major support of this broad-based rally. On the other hand, it could bolster the home-builders, which would, of course, be to the good. The tech sector appreciates lower interest rates as does the industrials and transports. If the 10-year runs to 2%, perhaps that will perturb sectors on the other side of the equation.We are going to need perfection, we are just overbought right now. In the above five possibilities, they all could turn out great, Trump could stick to the script, praise the Chinese and his friend President XI, and confirm that Phase One is proceeding as scheduled, the economic numbers could continue to please Goldilocks of the world, and the ROW - Rest of World - will continue to show that they are bottoming out. The 10-year could just as easily consolidate at this level and not go up or down. All I am saying is that we are well on our way of rising above even the most optimistic levels for the S&P 500 for 2019. Goldilocks may not be good enough.Cash and Hedge - The good news is the VIX fell on Friday back to 12.5, and from here and lower it would make sense to buy some insurance whether it is the SPY PUTs, and VIX CALLs, also again please slowly trim your full positions in your trading accounts. The call to generate cash has nothing to do with the cash or equivalents you should have in savings that should equal at least one year of your expenses. I am asking you to generate cash as a trading discipline, and this is something that I do periodically as the market rises in the fashion that it is right now. Generating cash is the cheapest hedge, especially if you have a brokerage account that charges no commission, you can sell one share a day from each position. At this point you should have some very nice profits, and if you aren't taking them now, when will you take them?This past week I talked about how the market has broadened and that the Transports and the Industrials will help power the Melt-up. The all-clear signal hasn't been sounded yet, we still have that double-top to contend with, but recent developments like the great earnings reports at UPS, and the performance of the railroads, tell me that the transports should be doing much better. Even the airlines have woken up nicely, look at Delta Air Lines (DAL) as an example. Perhaps it's not ready to give us new highs but the chart looks like we will revisit old highs at least. Let's look:The above chart is a 1-month chart, things look more complicated as you get to a bigger time scale...The top horizontal line shows that DAL has pierced most of the overhead congestion. The two lower lines are the rising lows, which show an acceleration to the upside. Of course, there is still a bunch of stranded holders of DAL overhead. But if the Melt-up is happening and transports are part of the rise of cyclical names, then DAL will power through. How does this square with my thought that the S&P will come in this week? Well, first thing, don't buy DAL at the open tomorrow. In fact, be smart and don't buy anything at the open unless you have an opportunity that is screaming at you. Maybe the S&P grinds out another leg up this week, and I will once again be in that comfortable position of being ""early."" There will be names that either break down and need to bounce or are breaking out and going higher. So wait, wait for that entry point, don't just buy just to buy. Okay?ValueAct Capital revealed a larger position in the industrial conglomerate of 24,211,698 shares, equal to about 19.7% of the tradable stock. The latest figure includes 1,650,000 shares purchased from Oct. 30 through Nov. 1 at prices of $19.67 to $20.49 each.My Take: ValueAct gave no reason for its latest acquisitions.This week we also noted insider buying at TRN & this is why I monitor insider activity. I wouldn't trade just on that one data item but by synthesizing different sources we surface actionable insights. Please read my November 6th piece on the transports, we tracked insider buying at FedEx (FDX) and TRN. Just last Wednesday I was a skeptic on the Transports because the chart was looking like a double-top. I now believe we will handily break above that formation to confirming the Transports and the Industrial sector leadership. This is just the quote from that Nov 6th piece on the TRN insider news:""Trinity Industries (TRN): Brandon B. Boze (Director) bought $20+ million in sharesMy take: Whoah! 20 million smackers for a train car manufacturer. What does Brandon know that we don't know? All of a sudden the transports are looking much better to me.""Now we have Earnings CalendarTuesday, November 12: Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP), CBS Corp. (CBS), D. R. Horton, Inc. (DHI), Datadog (DDOG), Rockwell Automation (ROK), SK Telecom Co., Ltd. (SKM), Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS).My Take: I am most focused on DHI, DDOG, ROK, and SWKS, for what they say about the sectors in Housing, IPOs, Industrials, and 5G. DDOG is a recent IPO and I am frankly having trouble figuring out which Cloud-App monitoring tool is better DDOG or New Relic (NEWR).

As chartists, we believe that all fundamentals (whether they be present or future) are actually reflected in the stock's price action on the technical chart. Therefore, one could argue that technical analysis actually includes fundamental analysis to a large degree.Many times, investors who predominantly use the fundamental analysis approach believe that a certain catalyst or trend will move the respective stock meaningfully in the future. Many forget though that the market already knows about this ""catalyst"" and that it has already been reflected in the share-price action of the stock.Trend-following is one of the corner stone aspects of the technical analysis approach. As mentioned in many of our articles, it is far more probable that a trend stays in motion rather than reversing. From this standpoint, we are eyeing up FedEx Corporation (FDX) for a possible swing play to the downside. Let's go through our reasoning behind why we currently have a short-term bearish bias towards this stock.As we can see from the long-term chart above, shares topped out from a nine-year bull run in early 2018. Since then which is over 20 months now, shares have continued to make lower highs and lower lows. The crossing of both the 50-week and 200-week moving averages is confirmation that we have a new intermediate trend in place. Trading in alignment with the underlying trend is very important with respect to our swing trading strategy. Obviously, we must be careful of binary events such as earnings announcements. Incidentally, FedEx is scheduled to announce its next set of earnings on the 17th of December next, so we have almost a two-month window here if we see fit to act.On the daily chart, we can see that we have a possible double-top formation in play. In fact, one could argue that the pattern has already played itself out because price dropped below the August low in both September and October. Therefore, what we would be looking for here is for the recent rally to turn over quickly and resume its journey southward (as shown below). Obviously, we would have no interest in getting short here until we see a see daily swing high in the share price. However, that breakaway gap from the second top as well as the large selling volume number definitely means that we most likely will get more downside here.From a valuation perspective, FedEx Corporation is definitely cheap. The company's sales multiple of 0.6 is well behind the average in this industry, which is 1.0, as well as FedEx's five-year average of 1.0. Furthermore the company pays out a 1.7% dividend, which is slightly below the average in the freight sector (2.1%). We like to see how the dividend has been trending to give us an insight on how much it will potentially grow going forward. FedEx Corporation has now grown its payout for 17 years straight. Although growth rates have been slowing, the dividend has increased significantly over the past decade.Predicting earnings growth is difficult, and some could say FedEx's fortunes are really a play on how much the global economy grows going forward. What we can look at however is how the interest coverage ratio as well as the debt-to-equity ratio have been trending. When a firm has little interest-bearing debt, it means more of its operating profit can subsequently drop to the bottom line.FedEx's interest coverage ratio has been dropping even if we exclude the recent May quarter where the reported operating profit number came in negative. Furthermore, the firm's debt-to-equity ratio of 1.7 is the highest it has been in more than a decade. Trends such as the above puts more pressure on earnings growth to keep on growing that dividend meaningfully. Therefore, it will be interesting to see whether there will be healthy demand for FedEx's services considering the recently announced price increase.To sum up, the latest earnings and top-line miss were the catalysts for more lower lows. We are conscious that this stock's downside may be limited, which is why we may only look to something like a swing trade in here at present."
4296199,20149,2019-10-12T03:54:31-04:00,"Whenever leading brands like FedEx see their stocks drop by 40% from 52-week highs, value investors should take a closer look.Despite the lower valuation, underlying cash flow generation at FedEx has been weak for the last decade.As long as the company needs debt financing to fully fund share buybacks, dividends, and ongoing capital needs, investors should be wary.","Back in 2006, shares of package delivery giant FedEx (FDX) peaked at around $120 before the recession hit. Thirteen years later FDX stock is trading down 40% from its 52-week high and even more from its latest peak (late 2017). Given the surge in e-commerce and the associated demand for global shipping services, the fact that FDX fetches just $140 per share in 2019 might look attractive to value-seeking investors:Data by YChartsSo how is it exactly that FDX is only in the low $140s versus $120 in 2006, given that the company's annual revenue has surged from $50 billion to $70 billion during that time? Sub-par cash flow generation on that revenue, to put it simply, would be my answer.I went back and looked at FDX's free cash flow in dollar and margin percentage terms over the last six years compared with total revenue:Source: Annual 10-K filings for last six fiscal years ending in MayTo put that $1.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the past six fiscal years into perspective, FDX's current market value is around $37 billion, so the stock is trading for 23 times trailing 72-month free cash flow. That is not exactly cheap despite the precipitous fall from the all-time high on a per-share quote basis.Perhaps it is unsurprising that a large, global logistics business like this is highly capital intensive and generates relatively low free cash flow. However, investors should be worried more when they see how much capital FDX has been returning to shareholders during this time.Again, from the company's filings, take a look at dividend payments and stock buybacks over the last six years:Taken together total capital return has amounted to $14.1 billion or $2.35 billion annually since 2014, which is 781% more than cumulative free cash flow generated from the business.So how has FDX been able to manage such a disparity between cash profits available for distribution and actual dividend and buyback activity? As you might have guessed, the answer is it has borrowed the money and turned right around and paid it out to its investors:Coincidentally, total long-term debt increases of $11.9 billion nearly map right onto the difference between total capital returns ($14.1 billion) and operating free cash flow ($1.6 billion) since 2014. So what conclusions can we draw about FDX's financial results and capital allocation strategy and their likely impact on future stock price performance?Well, first of all we can see why FDX stock has made minimal progress in recent years. Free cash flow has been stagnant even as revenue increases have been significant. The company has tried to offset this unimpressive financial performance by continually increasing its dividend and buying back stock to boost per-share figures, but its balance sheet is further impaired as a result.Looking ahead, there is little reason for optimism. Free cash flow remains weak and the company is likely to continue investing heavily in its business now that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making a big push into logistics and delivery.Further debt increases have an upper bound limit since borrowings have been growing faster than profits. Credit ratings matter and FDX is not going to endanger its investment-grade rating. As a result, stock buybacks will likely trail off relative to the recent past.As for the dividend, it would be nice to conclude that FDX has room to keep increasing that, at the very least, but even that is unclear. For the past three years, free cash flow has failed to cover the dividend. Unless the profitability of this business picks some steam soon, large dividend increases are unlikely. Management will still likely opt for small increases, but such a call will not be backed by cash flow, but rather the pressure to appease frustrated investors.In conclusion, I was hoping that FDX would look attractive after a huge decline. That is why I took a deeper look to start with. What I found was a company that despite a strong brand and surging revenue from steadily rising package delivery demand still generates minimal free cash flow. Ill-advised stock buybacks have increased leverage, which will only serve to limit future levers the company has available to increase shareholder returns. Despite what seems like a cheap price, relative to the past 12 months, I see no reason to be bullish about FedEx's future stock price potential."
4311968,24627,2019-12-11T14:41:59-05:00,"A trade deal with China is the most probable outcome, the timing of which appears to be the only real variable.Even if there was no deal and tariffs became the new normal, the trade war impact will fade, supply chains will simply change and global growth will resume.It makes sense to buy stocks that have been impacted by the tariffs and uncertainty surrounding trade, before the trade war and negative headlines become irrelevant.These two stocks are undervalued and offer dividend income that will pay investors while waiting for a rebound in the share price.","As many of you know, I am always looking for strategic buying opportunities that are created by everything from company specific news, to global events, to major stock market corrections. For example, in December of last year, the stock market was plunging due to fears of recession and rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. I saw that as a strategic opportunity to buy stocks and wrote this article last December, telling investors to put their emotions and fear aside and start buying stocks for 2019 gains. As you can see in the chart of the S&P 500 Index (SPY) below, the market put in a bottom in December and has rocketed much higher since:Even though it is tougher to find undervalued stocks with the market at or near all time highs, there are still niche opportunities for investors to take advantage of right now. I believe there will be a trade deal with China announced at some point and whether it is this month or sometime next year really does not matter because the stocks that have been negatively impacted by the trade war and the headlines, are simply too cheap to ignore at this point. Furthermore, the impact to the economy and stock market in the United States has been very limited; the same cannot be said for China with exports falling and declining growth. This shows that it is in China's best interest to make a deal. Finally, even if there is no trade deal and tariffs become the new normal, markets will adapt and global growth will continue longer term. With this in mind, let's take a look at two of my top undervalued dividend ideas to buy now.FedEx Corporation (FDX) is an industry leader in the shipping business, but you might not know that by looking at its stock price. It was at record highs of around $275 per share in 2018, and now it trades for nearly half that amount at $156 per share. I think the market got carried away when shares were trading for about $275. However, now it looks like the move to the downside has been excessive as well, and this has created a buying opportunity.The Chart: Fedex has been a great growth stock for many years, but as the chart below shows it has been sinking ever since it traded around the $275 level in 2018. However, it does look like the stock has put in a bottom, and it has even bounced off the lows it reached a few weeks ago. The 50-day moving average is around $153 per share and the 200-day moving average is about $164 per share. Based on this and with the stock now trading for roughly $156, a bullish potential ""Golden Cross"" formation could soon be appearing on the chart, since the stock is within striking distance of going above the 200-day moving average.This Stock Appears Undervalued: Analysts expect Fedex to earn about $15.52 in 2019 and the estimates for 2020 are around $12 per share. However, earnings are expected to rebound back to around the $15 level in 2021. Even at the expected low point in earnings of $12 per share, this implies a price to earnings ratio of just 13 times. At the $15 per share earnings level, this stock is only trading for about 10 times earnings. That is deeply undervalued based on historical valuations and also when compared to its competitors.For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is currently trading for about $117 per share. Analysts estimates are at $7.52 per share for 2019. That implies a price to earnings ratio of nearly 16 times earnings. This shows that Fedex shares have significant room for multiple expansion. At 16 times earnings of $12 per share, Fedex shares would be trading for $192, and at 16 times earnings of $15 per share, the stock would be worth $240 per share.Why There Is A Strategic Buying Opportunity In The Stock Today: Fedex shares have declined this year due to concerns about global growth and the trade war with China. Company specific issues have also impacted the stock. Fedex has been integrating the acquisition of TNT Express which appears to have brought about some challenges. Fedex has also reduced earnings guidance earlier this year which is why analyst estimates for 2020, have dropped down to about $12 per share. In addition, Fedex recently decided to end a delivery contract with Amazon.com (AMZN).All of these issues have led this stock to trade near 52-week lows and I believe that has created a strategic buying opportunity. All of these issues appear to be one time events that are resolvable. For example, if a trade deal is announced, this will presumably boost global growth and business confidence in general. That could lead to a situation where Fedex beats earnings expectations and even raises guidance. The challenges with integrating TNT Express appear to be fading over time and that could also lead to improved financial results. When negative headlines over the trade war and TNT express integration issues fade, the buying opportunity we have now in Fedex shares will be gone and that is why it makes sense to buy now.The Dividend Yield Is Generous And Could Keep Rising: In 2015, Fedex was paying a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share. Thanks to fairly consistent increases that usually occur around June, the quarterly dividend is 65 cents per share, or $2.60 per share on an annual basis. Based on current earnings and future estimates, Fedex clearly has room to continue increasing the dividend.Potential Downside Risks: A global recession appears to be the biggest macro risk for Fedex shares. I do believe that a lot of bad news regarding China and the integration of TNT Express is already priced into the stock, but it also seems clear that the stock will continue to trade off the headlines. That means if tariffs are raised on China by President Trump, the stock will surely have a bad day as emotion-stricken investors react and as computer driven algorithmic trading also hit the sell button. However, I would use that as another buying opportunity.Some investors are concerned about Amazon.com's foray into package delivery and the fact that Fedex ended a ground delivery contract with Amazon.com earlier this year. However, according to this CNBC article less than 1.3% of annual revenues for Fedex were attributed to Amazon.com. Furthermore, Amazon.com has recently reported challenges in package delivery during the current holiday season and that shows this business is not as easy as it might appear. Amazon.com is an amazing company, but when it comes to the package delivery business, I think it's safe to say that Fedex is the best. Based on the scant amount of business Amazon.com represented for Fedex and due to its far superior logistics and delivery capabilities, I think fears about Amazon.com are overblown. United Parcel Service has been a real competitor for many years and Fedex has done fine handling the competition.Potential Upside Catalysts and Price Target: Fred Smith, CEO and founder of Fedex has proven to be one of the best business managers over decades. Since he owns a significant stake of about 7.5% in the company, his interests are aligned with shareholders. I am sure he is fully motivated to see the shares rebound, and for dividend growth to continue. I am confident he will get the TNT Express integration issues resolved and that resolution will be an upside catalyst for the stock. Of course, a deal with China will help as well. With this stock trading near 52-week lows, and for almost half of the highs of 2018, it seems likely that these shares are seeing pressure at this time of year due to tax-loss selling. This selling pressure will come to an end soon and that means Fedex shares could rebound into January. On October 29, 2019, analysts at Wells Fargo initiated coverage with an outperform rating and set a $189 price target. I think that is a reasonable price target for the next few months, but longer term I feel that a $240 price target is achievable. This is based on a price to earnings ratio of 16, and earnings of about $15 per share.China Mobile Limited (CHL) is the leading provider of telecommunication services in mainland China. I make it a policy to generally avoid investing in Chinese firms due to concerns about different accounting standards and other issues. However, I am willing to make a few exceptions and China Mobile is one of them. This is one of the largest companies in China and when you combine that with the importance and stability of telecommunications along with a bargain valuation and a juicy dividend, I am a buyer. China has a huge population base, a growing middle class and having a mobile phone has become a necessity of life.The Chart: The chart below shows that China Mobile shares are now trading at the lowest level since 2012, which is about as far back as this chart goes. However, upon further research, this stock is now trading close to the lows of around $33 that it hit during the depths of the 2008 Financial Crisis. That's pretty amazing because the fundamentals of this company remain very strong and it is not too easy to get a chance to buy a solid company at is what is very close to the lows of the Financial Crisis.This Stock Appears Undervalued:At a current price of around $38, this stock is well below the 52-week high of $55.84. In fact, it is now trading close to the 52-week low of $37.44. Analysts expect the company to earn about $4 per share in 2019 and $4.22 per share next year. That implies that the stock is trading for just about 9 times earnings. This appears to be significantly undervalued based on the dominant position this company has in China and based on the stability of its revenue stream. It also appears undervalued when compared to the current price to earnings multiple of about 23, for the S&P 500 Index (SPY).Why There Is A Strategic Buying Opportunity In The Stock Today: The combination of the Trade War and the protests in Hong Kong have been a near perfect storm of negative news for many months. This has created the strategic buying opportunity and it gives us a chance to buy right around the 52-week low and for just about 9 times earnings. The most probable outcome is that both of these issues will fade from the headlines. At some point investors are going to return their focus on China's long term growth prospects and it is only a question of time before that happens. I think it is a particularly remarkable buying opportunity, since this stock is now trading near the lows of the Financial Crisis that started in 2008.The Dividend Yield Is Generous: China Mobile pays a dividend twice a year and the first payment is typically at the end of May and the second payment has been in October lately. The amount varies somewhat, but has generally been about $1.85 annually for the past couple of years. The dividend has not been really growing lately but with a yield of about 5%, that is already very generous.Potential Downside Risks:I think the top risk here is that this is a Chinese company and there is government oversight to say the least. The Trade War is an obvious overhang on this stock and the economy in China. However, another big issue is the continued protests in Hong Kong. It is hard to say how these protests and the issues that sparked them will be resolved and when. If the protesters grow weary and the issue fades over time, that will be a positive for Chinese stocks. If there is a major military confrontation that ends this, then there is likely to be another drop in China Mobile shares which is probably just another buying opportunity. Because of this, I would buy only a partial position now and accumulate over time. Both sides (Chinese Government and the protesters) have too much to lose, so some compromise is the most likely outcome.As far as company specific issues go, China Mobile might see margin pressures due to the investment in building out the 5G network. I would not let this concern overshadow the positives which include a generous dividend yield, and the long term growth potential that comes from the very large and growing population base in China.Potential Upside Catalysts and Price Targets: This stock is so beaten down this year due to the Trade War and the Hong Kong protests, that it might be due for a rebound even if these issues are not soon resolved. It just seems that the market might be overestimating the impact of these issues as far as it relates to revenues and profits for China Mobile, especially longer term. On October 1, 2019, analysts at Daiwa Securities upgraded this stock to a buy. The median analyst price target is about $49 per share which represents upside potential of nearly 30%. If you combine that with the dividend that will pay you while waiting for a higher share price, then the total upside potential is very attractive.Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

4295687,103219,2019-10-09T08:30:00-04:00,"FedEx continues to massively underperform the market.Analysts' estimates continue to trail down.Investors may have another 12 months of difficult news to deal with.The stock, however, is reaching a point of epic risk-adjusted rewards.","FedEx Corp. (FDX) has been a stark reminder to investors that it is a market of stocks out there. While the broader averages have treaded water, FedEx has taken a vertical plunge.Data by YChartsWe traditionally associate 20% declines as a bear market in the broader averages and FedEx has delivered 2X that, just in the past 12 months. As we browse Seeking Alpha, there are some compelling bull and bear cases. In general, the bulls have argued that the stock is cheap on forward earnings multiple, while the bears have pointed out that free cash flow has been consistently negative and Amazon (AMZN) might be a serious threat to the business. So far, the bull thesis has failed, rather appallingly. A key problem with trying to buy FedEx with the low multiple in mind is that the earnings are refusing to have any kind of bottom.Data by YChartsThis has resulted in the same argument being made on the way down.FDX is crazy cheap at 12X earnings of $17 (at $204), December 2018.FDX is crazy cheap at 12X earnings of $12 (at $144), September 2019.We are not making fun of that logic as FedEx has certainly surprised on the downside more than almost anyone expected in the midst of a strong economy. Bears have got this right till now as the falling profits and cash flow have further compounded FedEx's free cash flow promises.Data by YChartsBears now have the firm upper hand with no end in sight to FedEx's woes and recessionary fears further panicking the beleaguered bulls.Before we give you that, if you want a rather safe play on FedEx's issues, we highly recommend heading to this stock which has been beaten alongside FedEx but is really not going to be impacted by it. With that out of the way, let's focus on FedEx. The first question is whether something is fundamentally broken with the company. We think the answer is clearly no. The two commonly cited longer term issues, AMZN moving away and trade worries, do exist, but both are shorter term in nature. In the case of AMZN, FedEx had to go out of their way to show that unless they rescaled their graphs you could not even tell how little they cared about AMZN.Source: FedEx Presentation Yes, AMZN could also compete with FedEx, directly, and that should be part of every investor's long-term threat assessment, but the most likely scenario continues to be that AMZN will focus on its retail business and not try and take on FedEx directly. We also think the market will grow enough to accommodate another player if needed. We also believe the trade issues are likely to resolve sooner rather than later and FedEx will dust off its 2% exposure to China like it never even happened.Source: Commercial AppealThe second question to address is whether FedEx is a good value today. Investors, having been burned by FedEx's earnings projections which have matched the decline in the stock, are obviously feeling reluctant to use that as a gauge. After all, they certainly don't want to be saying FedEx is crazy cheap at 12X earnings of $8 (at $96). We think that the answer is more difficult to reach today than it has been in the past, simply because FedEx is going through a supercycle of capital upgrades and is reluctant to pull back. We saw this when Scott Group, who appeared to have lost all strength, was basically just begging for guidance from Alan Graf (CFO of FedEx).Source: FedEx transcript, emphasis oursThe $5.9 billion, while scary for the bulls, does underscore an important point. FedEx is spending a lot to upgrade their asset base, and assuming you don't think that they have suddenly lost their minds, it will pay off.While the cyclicality of their returns are not easy to see on shorter time frames, we can see it on longer time frames. Return on Assets, or ROA, for example, has fluctuated between 1% and 8% as FedEx goes through its profitability cycles. At 1%, we appear to be getting close to trough in our opinion.Data by YChartsOn the flip side, with all of this large spending in place and a largely expanded asset base, can you imagine how much will be generated at 8% in the next cycle? Another way to look at this is to see the ratio of FedEx's market cap to its capital expenditures. We view this as a proxy for how badly the market is punishing the stock for investing in itself.Data by YChartsWe are close to troughing levels again on this measure (near 7) in our opinion. One final measure we would look at is the price to sales ratio. This does make an implicit assumption that earnings and margins can fluctuate a lot, but the revenues are a better measure of longer term value. Based on that, FedEx has approached similar levels 5 times in the past 2 decades.Each was a good buying point, although the 2008-2009 selloff went much further than we would have expected. This appears as a longer term value opportunity and investors buying here likely made good risk-adjusted returns.We looked at FedEx through 3 unconventional measures and we think cumulatively they reflect the strong underlying value in the company. At this point, these measures agree with the earnings metric unlike at the earlier price peak a year back where we stayed out of the stock. Yes, things do look bad today, and yes, they can get worse, but when the time comes to buy, no one wants to. That is precisely where the most compelling opportunities set up."
4295062,103711,2019-10-04T11:43:42-04:00,"FDX has seen free cash flow diverge from earnings in a bad way.FDX has been leveraging up their balance sheet in order to fund their dividends and share repurchase programs.I like the e-commerce bull thesis, but not at 21 times free cash flow.I rate shares a hold.","FedEx (FDX) is one of the largest transportation and package delivery companies in the world. In my previous reports I raised concerns about free cash flow and the amount of debt being raised on their balance sheet, although I was still bullish. With shares trading in the dumpster, I take another look and explain where I went wrong in my previous analysis, as well as why I now rate shares a hold.FDX has been a poor performer since I last covered the stock:(Tipranks)FDX is closely tied to the broader economy, and that has seen significant turmoil from the ongoing trade war. That said, should shares trade at less than 10 times earnings? As we will see, things aren’t so simple.At first glance, FDX appears horribly mispriced as compared to historic valuations, as its recent price to earnings multiple of around 10 is a far cry from the 20s to 30s range its traded at in the past 5 years. I believe that the reason for this has to do with the growing discrepancy between earnings and free cash flow.In the past 3 years, free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures has been negative or barely positive. During this time period however, FDX has also returned more than $4 billion back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Something doesn’t add up - it doesn’t make sense for a company to be returning so much cash to shareholders in the absence of free cash flow. Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper?It makes sense for FDX to have high amounts of capital expenditure expenses due to the capital intensity of the business (think planes, automobiles, etc), but how much of the capital expenditures is recurring (like for maintenance) and how much is for growth initiatives?In every annual filing, FDX has one line of text projecting the capital expenditures related to “growth initiatives” for the following year. I note that I missed this in my previous analysis and that had I not missed it, I probably would not have issued those prior buy ratings. I primarily invest in free cash flow rich companies with growing dividends and large share repurchase programs - in the case of FDX I should have never gotten involved because at the time I was unable to get any estimate of free cash flow. In any case, with management’s commentary on how much of their capital expenditures are non-recurring, we are able to get a better picture of “true” free cash flow. We can see the estimated free cash flow based on the aforementioned disclosures for each year, and how they have compared to net income over time:(Chart by Best of Breed, data from 10-K)This chart says a lot - first, FDX does produce free cash flow and more or less was able to afford their shareholder returns over the past 3 years. But what I want the reader to focus on is how free cash flow has significantly diverged from earnings ever since 2016.FDX acquired TNT Express in 2016, which may help to explain the discrepancy. FDX is working through near-term integration expenses in relation to their acquisition of TNT Express. In their 2018 annual filing they noted that they completed their integration in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East. FDX expects to incur $350 million of integration expenses in 2020.FDX expects the aggregate integration expenses to total $1.7 billion through 2021 - so this should help bolster free cash flow then as expenses drop off. Even so, even adding back the approximately $400 million in annual integration expense back to free cash flow, we still would have a significant discrepancy from earnings. It appears that the TNT acquisition has significantly reduced their free cash flow conversion rate, making earnings arguably no longer suitable as a valuation metric.Due to not producing meaningful free cash flow over the past years, FDX has had to fund their growth capital expenditures by issuing debt (or depending on how you like to look at it, they issued debt to buy back shares and pay their dividend). This has led their debt to adjusted EBITDA multiple to expand from 1.9 times in 2017 to 2.25 times in 2018. While this may be a reason for concern, I think that given FDX’s credit reputation and their risk strategy below, we can give them a pass in the near term.FDX has attempted to mitigate balance sheet risk by staggering their debt maturities so that no particular year has an outsized maturity of debt:(2018 10-K)This means that if FDX were to encounter a “credit freeze” which inhibits their ability to issue new debt to redeem debt maturities, then FDX would not have such a large amount of debt to deal with in any given year. The largest near term maturities appear to be the next 3 years with $959 million, $1.21 billion, and $1.58 billion in 2020, 2022, and 2023 respectively. I anticipate that FDX could simply cease share repurchases and perhaps slow down growth investments in such a scenario. That said, FDX also has around $2 billion of cash, as well as a 5-year $2 billion revolving credit facility and a 364-day $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. Finally, FDX has a solid investment grade credit rating of BBB or equivalent from S&P and Moody’s. FDX has more leverage than I would like and I would prefer that they did not continue issuing debt to buy back shares during a period of limited free cash flow, but their balance sheet does not appear to be in any immediate danger.FDX has been a strong dividend growth stock with a trailing 5 year CAGR of 27%:(2019 Presentation)While the EPS payout ratio is low at around 15%, free cash flow is considerably less than earnings and the company continues to overspend internally generated cash flows, significantly raising the risk profile of the dividend. While I believe that FDX may be able to raise the dividend considerably in the long term, there are many factors which might put the safety of the dividend in question for short periods of time, especially their high capital requirements and leveraged balance sheet.FDX trades around 9.4 times trailing adjusted EPS of $15.12, but given the large amount of recurring capital expenditures, free cash flow is a better metric for true “cash earnings.” FDX generated $6.65 in free cash flow per share in 2018. At recent prices, FDX trades at 22 times free cash flow, which clearly isn’t as cheap as the 9.4 times adjusted EPS multiple would make it seem. Management’s guidance for $5.9 billion in 2020 capital expenditures with 40% associated to growth initiatives implies roughly $3.5 billion in recurring capital expenditures, down from $3.8 billion in 2018. Management needs to execute on the potential TNT synergies they have been touting in order for free cash flow to once again converge towards earnings.I believe that given a long term time frame, FDX will be able to realize such synergies in addition to significantly expanding their network and benefitting from a more stable economy. In a situation where free cash flow approaches earnings plus higher earnings overall, I see FDX trading up to at least 15 times earnings. Fellow contributor Ian Bezek made a good case for why he thinks this might happen.However, all of this would be based solely on management’s execution which has proven shaky in recent years considering the poor free cash flow conversion rate even after deducting growth initiative spending. As a result, I am unable to place any significant conviction on shares based on their current financial position and would need to see real progress before turning bullish again.FDX isn’t the safe dividend growth stock that it may appear to be, as free cash flow has significantly diverged from earnings. Nonetheless I think that FDX should be able to survive this difficult period and emerge with stronger cash flows and a better capitalized balance sheet. However, until I see real signs that they are able to generate better returns on their investments, I am moving to the sidelines as it’s hard to have conviction on promises alone. I like the e-commerce bull thesis, but not at 21 times free cash flow. I rate shares a hold.(Tipranks: Hold FDX)"
4293876,44781,2019-09-27T07:11:20-04:00,"I'm not happy that FDX missed its recent dividend increase.But, I'm also not interested in selling my shares into recent weakness.I think this company has the potential to bounce back long-term and investors interested in gaining exposure to the logistics space should look into the stock.","In a market where attractive value is hard to come by, FedEx’s (FDX) recent sell-off has certainly caught my eye. Truth be told, there may not be another U.S. company that has been hurt worse by the U.S./China trade war than this one. Since the start of this trade skirmish, FedEx has missed expectations and been forced to lower earnings guidance several times. Many believe that FDX CEO Fred Smith is one of the finest executives in the world, yet he doesn’t appear to have an answer to the headwinds that his company faces. Up until recently, FDX was considered a best in breed name in the transports space, yet rival United Parcel Service (UPS) is beating it handedly on a relative basis. It wasn’t long ago that FDX was thought of as one of the best, high dividend growth companies out there as well, yet its recent troubles have been so bad that the company missed its recent dividend increase and the company’s annual dividend increase streak is now under threat. Simply put, it’s difficult to find redeeming qualities about this stock right now. Analysts are jumping ship left and right. But, you know what they say about buying when there is blood in the streets. The broader markets may still be doing fine, but FDX shares are beaten and bloody for sure. So, should value oriented dividend growth investors consider buying shares of this stock while it's in the trade war dog house?FedEx just reported its Q1FY20 results and the stock slipped more than 15% on the data. The quarterly results met expectations on the top-line, but EPS came up short. It wasn’t this quarter’s data that really spooked investors, but instead the disappointing guidance that management gave during the recent quarterly conference call. It’s clear now that FDX has issues because lowered guidance is becoming a trend here.In short, this is the statement given by CFO Alan Graf, that really caused the stock to tank:“Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $11 to $13 per share. The new forecast reflects our lowered revenue outlook, driven by increasing trade tensions, and the corresponding weakening in global economic conditions, especially industrial production that has occurred since our June earnings release. With the increasing uncertainty of trade negotiations and government policies, forecasting customer demand and our corresponding earnings is exceedingly difficult.Our forecasts assume moderate U.S. economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. A further ramping and anti-trade measures and/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business. While our current expectation is to earn slightly above the midpoint of our $11 to $13 range, we believe the range is appropriate given the current macro and business conditions we are experiencing.”CEO Smith began the call highlighting three primary concerns that he brought up to the board in a recent meeting:“One, beginning in the fall of 2018, it had become clear that global trade disputes were adversely affecting manufacturing in Europe and Asia, thereby slowing international shipping demand.”“Two, our TNT integration was facing its most important phase, leading to the integration of European ground operations by the end of FY 2020.”“And three, we plan to add capabilities to enhance our services for the rapidly growing e-commerce market, which we expect to grow in the United States from 50 million to 100 million packages per day by 2026.”To me, 2 of the 3 of these challenges present clear upside opportunity. The trade war has been a major concern for FedEx for a while now, yet unless you believe that the spat between the U.S. and China is going to go on indefinitely, it should be only a matter of time before some of the macro issues that are holding the company’s growth back dissipate. Personally, I think FDX would be one of the biggest benefactors of a trade war agreement. FDX shares were trading well above $200 when these issues began and even though the stock is below $150 today, I think we’d be talking about a $200+ stock again very quickly if a deal was made.The third bullet point regarding the growth on e-commerce presents another growth opportunity for FDX. Historically, FDX has focused on B2B shipping, which still makes up the majority of its volumes. However, it’s clear that the rise of e-commerce is a long-term growth market and Smith believes that FDX can use its leading ground shipping network and technologies to compete for more market share.Management noted that it believes that “more than 90% of incremental domestic parcel volume from 2018 to 2026 is expected to come from e-commerce”.With this in mind, the company is rapidly building out its infrastructure to capture this market share and better serve consumers' needs. FDX has the most automated infrastructure delivery in the industry (due to management’s heavy investments into its network technologies over the years) and it believes that it has the opportunity to take significant market share due to its ability to offer best-in-class service at very competitive rates.Throughout the conference call we heard several executives talk about the importance of capturing market share in the e-commerce area because of the double digit CAGR that market is expected to experience in the coming years. It’s clear this is a priority for the company and I think it makes a lot of sense.When investors talk about B2C/last mile shipping (especially in the domestic market) they become worried about Amazon (AMZN) as the 800 lb. gorilla in the room, known for disrupting the industries that it enters. Shipping costs are a major headwind for AMZN’s retail segment and as you can see on the graphic below, that company is making strides to deliver more and more of its own packages. You’ll also notice on the graph that FDX has very little exposure to AMZN. FDX recently ended its relationship with that company, which was a short-term headwind for the B2C ground shipping volumes. However, management noted that the AMZN business came with unique costs and FDX has already lined up new clients to help replace the lost volumes that should generate higher margins.Source: Q1 CC Presentation, Slide 3The last challenge that Smith listed regarding the important phase of the TNT integration is more of a tossup to me. I was initially bullish on the TNT move when FDX made it because I thought globalization was a force that was here to stay and increasing international market share was going to be a good thing. Well, since then we’ve seen a rise in nationalism across the globe and a weakening in the Eurozone, making TNT look much less attractive. Long-term, I think this move will prove to be productive, but in the short-term, my European outlook isn’t bright (especially on a relative basis to the U.S. and even Asian markets) which creates doubt in my mind with regard to management hitting its original goals for TNT integration.Staying true to its history, FDX continues to invest in itself. Smith highlighted a handful of improvements that the company hopes to make in the FedEx ground area, expanding its oversized packaged delivery capacity and increasing the number of return services and pickup/drop off points. The company is also adding FedEx direction options for heavy/hard to handle items, which management believes can add millions to its package volumes.In short, FDX appears to have its sight on the USPS with regard to the domestic ground market. Smith noted in the call that these investments will increase capex in the short-term, yet he (and the Board of Directors) agree that they will “significantly reposition FedEx for strong future earnings.”In the face of weakness, FDX is also taking steps to reduce costs. Smith mentioned that the company was retiring/grounding nearly 20 aircraft due to softening in the global economy. Graf noted that, “The modernization of our aircraft fleet lowers costs through enhanced reliability, reduced maintenance costs, and improved fuel efficiency.”Considering the company’s negative outlook on both domestic and global trade/economic health, I think these measures also make sense and show that this management team is taking steps to protect its bottom-line.Regarding this negative economic outlook, in the CC, Executive Vice President, Brie Carere mentioned that the company is reducing its outlook for domestic growth as well, with its real GDP estimate falling 20 bps to 2.3%.She cited weak domestic PMI as one of the primary signs of a slowdown in the United States. She cited weakness in Germany’s manufacturing segment and the pressures that Brexit is having not just on Britain, but also its major trading partners in the region, as primary reasons for Europe’s slowdown as well.Carere highlighted China’s industrial performance being at a 10-year low, in large part, due to the trade war. She mentioned that this has led to pain for all Asian economies with high exposure to China.In short, the global growth picture is a bleak one. Carere said that in the most recent quarter, global trade volumes declined year over year for the first time since 2009. She thinks that the negative global PMI numbers are pointing towards a negative annual trade volume figure as well. This hasn’t happened since 2009, either.Carere closed her statement regarding the macro outlook strongly, saying:“As we have stressed before, a zero tariff zero subsidy global trade environment is the most powerful economic growth engine there is. We will continue to push for policies that stimulate rather than depress global trade.”While management was frank that political decisions being made across the world are hurting growth, they weren’t completely negative on their company’s own outlook. After her trade war critic, Carere then moved on to “what we can control”, highlighting the continued long-term opportunity to benefit from international growth, saying:“Right now our sights are set on an addressable transportation market totaling $550 billion worldwide. The majority of this opportunity lies outside of the United States where FedEx share has significant opportunity for growth. International is a clear opportunity for us with tremendous runway ahead.”This echoed the tone heard throughout the rest of the call. Management was cautious in the short-term due to issues that are largely out of its control, but remains bullish long-term because of the secular tailwinds that the logistics industry benefits from.I agree that the logistics space is a good place to be invested long-term. But, FedEx isn’t the only option.The performance gap between FDX shares and UPS shares thus far throughout 2019 is very interesting to me. As you can see on the graph below, UPS has posted serious alpha relative to its largest peer in the logistics space.Historically, we’ve seen FDX provide better growth and generally speaking, higher margins. The main complaint you see investors making when comparing these two business models is the impact of extensive unionization. FDX appears to empower drivers more in an entrepreneurial way, which has led to more productivity. In the graphic below you'll see the 5-year averages from both companies when it comes to sales, EPS, gross margin, and net margin. It’s this higher productivity that has historically led investors to believe that FDX was the best-in-breed play. Not only has FedEx produced better growth, but the company has been known for being more aggressive in technological investments and M&A moves that are meant to increase operational efficient and market share, leading to a tighter grip on large market share over the long-term. This is why the net margin figure is lower in the graph above. For years, FDX’s higher capex as a percentage of operating cash flows was applauded. The market viewed this as a forward thinking company with a strong growth mindset. Well, now that growth has slowed, we’re quickly seeing the positive sentiment surrounding the change.While FedEx’s recent results are certainly better than UPS’s, it's not as if the UPS results are bad. Give me mid-single digit sales growth, high single digit EPS growth, and a 3.5% dividend yield and I’m going to be a happy camper every day of the week. Since UPS’s results have been more stable in the face of the trade war, I think the market is coming to a conclusion.FDX’s focus on generating outsized growth in foreign markets is backfiring, in large part, due to the trade war. Thankfully for FDX investors, I don’t think we’re looking at a secular issue here. I don’t believe that we’ve seen the end of globalization. Sure, there has been a rise of protectionist/nationalistic politics in our years, but if I know anything about politics it’s that it typically doesn’t take long for the pendulum to swing the other way.I also think the higher yield has made UPS more attractive on a relative basis in this Z.I.R.P./N.I.R.P./T.I.N.A. world that we live in. I know that’s why I prioritized building out my UPS position rather than my FDX position earlier in the year when both stocks were beaten down. Since then, UPS has posted 20%+ gains whereas FDX is still hovering around 52-week lows. Admittedly, this short-term outperformance could simply be dumb luck on my part. But, I think there is something to a safe, high yield that offers reliable dividend growth in today’s market.Speaking of dividends, I think it’s important to focus on the fact that FedEx missed its recent dividend increase. This company usually announces increases in June when declaring the July dividend. However, in 2019, management stuck with the $0.65/share figure that FDX had been paying. FDX has now declared that $0.65/share dividend for 6 quarters in a row. The company maintains its dividend growth streak at the moment because 2019’s annual dividend will still be higher than 2018’s. However, for management to avoid a freeze and extend FDX’s annual dividend increase streak from 17 to 18 years, management will have to post a raise in the coming quarters.I respect FDX management for being conservative and wanting to get as much information regarding the global trade outlook that it can before increasing the burden that its dividend will have on its cash flows/balance sheet. Obviously a frozen dividend is much better than a slashed dividend. But, considering the fact that the current annual payment is $2.60 and FDX is guiding from ~$12/share in EPS in 2020 at the mid-point (representing a 21% forward payout ratio), I think the company still has room to grow its dividend without putting the balance sheet at risk alongside capex, investments, and pension obligations.FDX’s yield remains quite low even after the recent sell-off. Right now, shares yield just 1.71%. I’m happy to own a stock with a yield less than 2% so long as it provides reliable double digit growth. As a long-term investor, I can appreciate the compounding power of double digit growth; it doesn’t take long for the passive income generated by even the smallest initial yield on cost to become significant if it's compounding at a double digit rate.For years, FDX achieved my expected results. This is why I’m long a full position of FDX shares. FDX’s quarterly dividend has doubled in size, twice, since 2013 and considering the low payout ratio, I thought it could double again over the next 5 years or so. Yet, management’s recent decision regarding the dividend appears to point towards a more cautious approached towards shareholder returns and if FDX cannot be viewed as a top-tier dividend growth name, then their yield becomes much less attractive.Right now, I’m down ~26% on my FDX which has a cost basis of $196.92. I bought my FDX shares into weakness, but frankly put, I underestimated the impact of the trade war and I was too early. I haven’t added to the position because it carries a full weighting and while I think the stock is cheap now, the company’s low yield and dividend growth prospects aren’t yet attractive enough for me to double down.As you can see on the F.A.S.T. Graph below, FDX shares are trading at their cheapest levels in years when using trailing twelve month data. But, the stock market isn't about the past, but instead, growth potential in the future. Using management's negative guidance, FDX shares aren't trading quite as cheaply as they appear at first sight. My next target entry point would be looking at the ~10x forward EPS mark, which is in the $120 range (if the dividend were still growing at a double digit pace, that target multiple would be much higher). But, since it isn't, I'm relying primarily on value to inspire a purchase rather than dividend growth oriented metrics and when that's the case, I need to see a really wide margin of safety.Source: F.A.S.T. GraphsHowever, since I’m down double digits, I also have no inclination to sell the stock because I absolutely hate locking in losses. Long-term, I continue to believe that FDX will be fine. If I had to guess, in a decade or so, I’d say that FDX shares will carry a much higher share price than they do today. With that viewpoint in mind, why would I lock in losses when I could simply wait and let time turn them into gains?I’m happy to stay put in the stock for now, ignoring a lot of the short-term noise related to trade, and instead focusing on the long-term growth prospects of the logistics industry. UPS appears to be the safer stock pick to me right now, but that doesn’t mean that FDX has lost its blue chip status. If there’s one thing I know about the stock market, it’s that buying and holding shares of high quality U.S. companies typically lead to wealth creation over time. I see no reason why FDX would turn out to be an outlier in this regard. I’m certainly disappointed in the dividend growth news and I’d obviously rather see all of my positions in the green rather than the red, but I remain bullish on FDX and at these beaten down levels, I think value investors should give this company a look because it’s trading for just 12x the mid-point of its updated 2020 guidance.This article was previously published for members of The Dividend Growth Club."
4293308,104099,2019-09-24T14:23:30-04:00,"I think the story of the TNT Express acquisition presents a cautionary tale for investors.Although this is a global brand with a very deep moat, I suggest investors wait for a more attractive entry price.For those like me who lack patience, I suggest a short put option strategy that generates premium and locks in a great price.","The past twelve months have been painful for FedEx Corp. (FDX) shareholders, with the shares down ~39%. I thought I’d look in on the name for a few reasons. First, I think FedEx is a relevant cautionary tale for investors. I’m nervous about acquisitions in general, as they have a nasty tendency to fail, and the TNT Express story here is very relevant in my view. Second, it seems that the “future of e-commerce” thesis is now two decades old.It’s interesting to me that some market participants treat this thesis like it’s new. Third, and most importantly, FedEx is a great, iconic, global brand, and at some point it’ll be worth buying, and I want to know if the current $148 is the right price. I’ll try to answer that question by looking at the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. For those who can stand neither the suspense nor my writing, I’ll come to the point. I think FedEx is worth ~$135 per share. Rather than sit and wait for the shares to fall further, though, I’m going to be executing an options trade and I recommend readers do the same.I am mistrustful of acquisitions because they have a very nasty habit of failing. In fact, while I was eagerly buying rails a few years back, the TNT Express acquisition caused me to shy away from FedEx. In this section, I’ll do my best to chart the level of optimism surrounding this deal because I think it’s typical of other acquisitions investors have seen. I would suggest that if investors hear stories like this from other companies in future, they might be wise to sit on the sidelines. If the great synergies do materialize, there’ll be little harm waiting for some proof. If the great returns don’t materialize as quickly as at first imagined, investors will be able to buy shares at a relative discount.The market’s initial attitude about the TNT acquisition was similar to what the market always thinks about acquisitions. The acquisition would go smoothly and present great “synergies,” as TNT’s European business would complement FedEx’s North American and Asian strength. There was evidence that TNT’s business was sluggish, but no matter. FedEx would somehow imbue TNT Express with something. Ultimately, FedEx spent $4.9 billion of shareholder capital to buy TNT Express.The market didn’t like it when FedEx disclosed higher costs associated with the TNT acquisition, but management continued to maintain that after 2020, there would be $750 million in annual synergies. For their part, Wall Street remained fully committed. Baird suggested that investors “buy the dip” when FedEx got to 190 in December of 2016 and Cowen suggested that investors “lock in” for the long term. That was nearly 3 years and $40 ago. Six months later, there was a nasty cyber attack that ultimately cost FedEx shareholders ~$400 million ($1.19 per share).During the most recent earnings call, Fred Smith admitted that FedEx was “late and over budget” on the TNT integration. Management projected operating income from ground in 2020 to be ~$1.2-$1.5 billion higher than in 2017. As of now, it’s ~$300 million lower than in 2017. As of pp. 53 of the most recent 10-K, the TNT Express integration has cost FedEx shareholders about $1.92 billion over the past three fiscal years, with the company spending $388 million in the most recent fiscal year. It seems that results have so far not met earlier expectations.When I think about acquisitions, I’m reminded of Homer Simpson telling his father that Simpson and Son Revitalizing Tonic isn’t like his other get rich quick schemes. With this scheme, he’s sure to get rich... and quick. The point is that, in spite of their repeated failures, we continue to hold out hope that acquisitions are going to pay off. The weight of evidence suggests that they generally don’t.I remember getting excited about FedEx as a “play” on “e-commerce” in the early 2000s, when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was only seven years old. Here it is 17 years later and the same thesis applies. FedEx is the future of e-commerce... and always will be. In spite of the fact that FedEx has just fired Amazon as a client, it remains a great “play” on e-commerce. For that reason, it may act as a great hedge for investors who still own so-called “brick and mortar” retailers. Finally, as an aside, I have to admit that I find the phrase “e-commerce” quaintly anachronistic. It hearkens back to a time when buying online seemed an exotic, separate thing to do. Online buying of most things is now so mainstream that to have a separate category for it seems odd.Source: FedEx Investor Presentation, September 2019The following is a reasonable assessment of the current challenges facing FedEx from the good folks at Cowen (the people who told investors to stay the course three years and $40 ago). I think this analyst is correct, and that 2019 is largely a “transition” year for FedEx and that we should not expect much from the company over the near term. Evidence of this can be found in the most recent quarterly results, where revenue was basically flat relative to the same period a year ago, while net income declined ~11%.Stepping back from the quarterly analysis for a moment, FedEx has grown nicely over the past six years, with revenue up at a CAGR of 7.3% during that time. A retirement plan expense of $3.251 billion dropped net income in 2019 relative to 2018, which I’m not overly worried about.I do like the fact that management treats shareholders well in regard to dividend and buyback policies. Management has returned just over $13 billion to shareholders since 2014 alone ($10.6 in the form of stock buybacks, the balance from dividends). Thus, while I think the TNT acquisition may have been poorly thought through, management is at least shareholder-friendly in their orientation in my view. I consider this to be a necessary precondition to investing in a company, because a management team that is unfriendly to shareholders virtually guarantees capital loss.Turning briefly to the capital structure, although the level of debt has grown massively over the past several years, I’m not that concerned about it. First, the company has cash and receivables that are equivalent to about 63% of long-term debt. Second, fully 66% of this debt is due after 2027, suggesting that there’s little reason to worry about a solvency crisis here anytime soon. Finally, the weighted average interest rate of ~3.5% is not excessive in my view.Source: Company financialsAs my regular readers are no doubt tired of hearing, I’m of the view that investors need to think about the stock as a thing distinct from the business. The reason for this is that the stock is often a poor proxy for the health of the underlying business. Sometimes the market becomes too optimistic about the shares, and when that happens, the future returns are likely to be poor. For instance, at the height of the TNT Express acquisition talk, the shares traded to optimistic levels. If shares are priced for perfection, any problem (like a massive cyber attack for instance) will surprise investors and the shares will be punished. At the same time, if the market is excessively pessimistic, the shares may represent great value.So, when I review an investment, I want to get a sense of how optimistic or pessimistic the market is at the moment. One of the ways I do this is by employing the methodology described by Professor Stephen Penman in his book “Accounting for Value.” This approach involves isolating the “g” (growth) variable in a relatively standard finance formula to work out what the market must be assuming about the very long-term prospects for a given company. Using this approach indicates to me that, at the current price, the market is pricing FedEx like it will grow at 2.6% in perpetuity. In my view, this is a bit excessive in light of the history of choppy returns over the past several years.I also look at the trailing PE and price to free cash flow measures. At the moment, both of them are off the chart (quite literally) per the graphic below.Source: GurufocusAlso, I compare the trailing PE multiple to the forward multiple and ask the question: ""holding all else constant, what has to happen to ‘e’ to line up the trailing to the forward PE multiples?"" Given that the forward PE is sitting around 12, we’re collectively forecasting that FedEx earnings will grow to ~$12-12.50. I consider that to be a bit optimistic, given the recent history.All of this suggests to me that the shares remain somewhat optimistically priced, and for that reason I can’t bring myself to buy them at these levels.I’m not willing to buy FedEx at the current levels, but I do think it’s a great business, with a deep moat. I also think that it will benefit from the continued growth of “e-commerce.” So, I want to buy, but not at current levels. I have a choice, therefore. I can sit and wait for the shares to drop to my target price of $135 or I can simply sell some put options with a strike of $135. The latter option is preferable to me for a couple of reasons. First, I’m very impatient, and waiting for prices to drop is interminably dull, while selling puts allows me to “do something” now. Second, I’m willing to be a very long-term owner at $135, and selling puts with that strike price allow me to collect some premium.At the moment, my favorite of these puts is the April 2020 put with a strike of $135. These are currently bid-asked at $7.55-$8.45. If an investor simply takes the bid, and is subsequently exercised, they will do so at a price ~14% below the current level. If the shares rally from these levels, my caution will have been misplaced, but the $755 of put premiums buys a decent amount of consolation scotch.In my view, FedEx is a great business, with a very large “moat,” and a great runway of growth (pun intended). The company is an obvious beneficiary from so-called “e-commerce” (when are we just going to call it ‘commerce?’). I certainly want to own this business. Management certainly made a mistake with the TNT Express acquisition, but the pain of that mistake will be (relatively) short-lived in my view. My problem relates to the current share price. It’s just a bit too rich for my blood at these levels.Thankfully, the options market provides investors with an alternative to waiting for shares to drop to more reasonable levels. I’m willing to obligate myself to buy these shares at $135, and I’m comfortable accepting $7.55 per share to take on that obligation. If I’m correct, and shares drop from here, I’ll own them at what I consider to be a satisfactory price. If the shares rise from here, I’ll keep the premium. Thus, I think short put options represent a “win-win” for investors at these levels."

Still, the precarious drop in the share price does mean I made a miscalculation with regards to timing when doing my previous purchase/s.As a conservative dividend investor who means to learn from investment mistakes, no matter their size, I intend to here look back into FedEx and see if there are risks of thesis-breaking pieces of news which should cause concern to even long-term investors, or if my mistake is simply limited to ""only"" buying the company at a bad time, despite the perceived undervaluation.Let's get going and see if 1.7% yield for this company is worth investing in.Anyone who invests in the space knows (or should know) the current worries in trade uncertainties and macro - these have continued to plague the company for the past quarter. These were also part of the reason for:No arguing - this was pretty damn terrible. The company's stock has taken the expected hit and is currently trading at share prices below the January 2019 dip.Let's take a closer look at some of the items, beginning with the loss of Amazon.While there's no question that Amazon (AMZN), for a company like FedEx, provides a sheer volume of packages and shipments, there are the questions of how valuable the e-retailer actually was due to the margin pressures. Many have questioned - me included - what profit margins FedEx actually had with Amazon. Over the course of the past few months, we've gotten some indications - namely that Amazon wasn't all that good a customer for FedEx to have.In fact, material from quarterly reports has shown Amazon to be a terrible customer when looking for profits. Companies like FedEx don't make a whole lot of money from focusing on the so-called deferred package segment (non-overnight), which is also characterized by high volumes but smaller and smaller margins. One could go so far as to say that Amazon and similar customers/contracts have been part of the reasons for FedEx problems for a number of quarters now - and why the reason to drop Amazon is actually an excellent one.(Source: 1Q20 Earnings call Slides)Operating margin numbers for the contract between Amazon and FedEx were under 0.25%, ""Somewhere between tiny and zero"". (Source)So while the decision to cut Amazon will and has affected volume and sales mix numbers, as well as a likely short-term effect to revenue per package, the overall long-term effect of dropping Amazon will likely be positive. There's also some consensus that FedEx will recover from this contract cancellation quickly. (Source)And while many currently laud UPS (UPS) as a working and profitable alternative to FedEx, the fact is that the company has exactly the same problem as FedEx - though currently unaddressed. It's hard to compare the two companies in this field because UPS does not report the same metrics that FedEx does (It does not report individual revenue per package on an individual customer basis). Because of this, comparing this or estimating the effect of Amazon on UPS profits is a bit of a gamble.Here's what we know, however.Rumors are already around that UPS may follow FedEx's example and not renew contracts with the retailer.Even if UPS does not ditch Amazon - perhaps the reverse will happen, with Amazon already looking into their own B2C logistical solutions. In this case, FedEx would, of course, be in a much better position than the company being left/cut out.So - in closing here, I don't consider Amazon an appealing customer for FedEx, and I consider the company better off long-term.But of course, this isn't the only current problem with FedEx.It would be incorrect to characterize UPS as the only company looking to invest in increased capacities at this time. FedEx is looking to add further capabilities for the growth in E-commerce, as they expect the number of packages per day to double until 2026. The big difference here is that many of these packages will be shipped not to centers, but to residences, as well with an increased volume mix in favor of short-distance deliveries. This will a challenge that needs to be surmounted for a company that's traditionally been a B2B, not a B2C business.Another upcoming woe/headwind is the fact that a large amount of the ground growth is to be expected in the short-haul zone/segment, meaning not all that high-profit margins or yields.(Source: 1Q20 Earnings call Slides)The company is also taking steps to address the softening macro situation, in this case through the retirement of over a dozen MD10-10 aircraft as well as likely retiring another 10 A310s during 2019, resulting in the elimination of this fleet type.(Source: Youtube)The main issue for the company remains the stressed geopolitical, macro situation. With weaker growth and contraction in the industrial sector, inventory buildups and softness across the world are causing deep troubles for companies like FedEx - forcing them to react through capacity cuts and investment reconsiderations.The company's response to this continues to be the overall global transportation market where the company, through its TNT M&A, has the position, once things are integrated and working, to be a better competitive player on the global scale.(Source: 1Q20 Earnings call Slides)Unfortunately, these plans have been hampered in part by the tariffs, macro reactions and industrial softness, which have caused reductions in freight volume, which in turn lead to the situation we're seeing today - including the share price.FedEx has not been idle, however. The company has:Through these ambitions (among other things), the company means to recapture growth and get back into a more profitable operation.More importantly, however, what sort of value are we getting if we invest in FedEx today?(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)Today, we have better targets and better circumstances than at the time of publishing of my previous article. The expectation is more realistic for 2020, but even considering such low figures and conservative estimates, the company is trading at barely 10 times earnings at this time. Granted, to go by P/E during such a troubled time may be questionable, but that and peer comparisons (as well as other key metrics) are the best we have at the moment.Only during the very shortest time in 2009 did the company - in the midst of an ongoing recession - trade lower than it does today - and only by very few points, also roughly 10 times earnings.Even had you invested prior to this, FedEx is an investment that would have paid off over a long time, as the company beat the S&P 500 development. The company also averaged a dividend growth of 17.5% annually during the time - a very good number.It also bears mentioning, as I wrote in my first article, that the company payout ratio has historically been below 10% of operating earnings. Only lately has this climbed, and now stands at about 16.8%. FedEx is a company which reinvests profits into the business, under the hope that eventually this will pay off - as I consider it likely that it will.Nor is P/E-metrics the only highlight of the relative undervaluation here. The company also trades below 5 times EBITDA (usually above 6.3) and at very favorable valuations in terms of EV/EBITDA. While the current (and 5 quarters past) troubles really highlight the weaknesses of a logistics company in a precarious situation, one should not forget the fundamental advantages of this company.All in all, I consider the value proposition appealing here.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)The company need not provide market premium valuations in order to give market-beating returns either. All it needs to do is return to a standard, fair value - as it was perhaps a year or so ago.If it does, your potential returns go up over 20% including dividends - and for one of the world's largest freight companies, this is impressive indeed. Even were the company to drop to 7 times earnings, your position would not be in the negative in the long run, given the company's dividend and dividend growth policies.This provides an excellent safety net, while at the same time providing a good possibility for market-beating upside long-term.This is exactly what I am looking for.So, because of macroeconomic conditions, industrial softness and the general geopolitical situation, FedEx has chosen to reduce guidance by almost $0.9B in operating profit during the fiscal. Together with other negative factors, risks and emotions associated with the company's business and operating segment, this has pushed the valuation and company stock price in a very negative direction indeed. The fact that this was the fifth straight quarter of misses and/or cutting did not help matters one bit.The company's current position is severalfold - namely that of trying to operate a profitable transporting/freight business in the emerging age of E-commerce while navigating geopolitical trade tensions, softening industrial output and while trying to modernize the entirety of the aircraft fleet.The challenges of such a position are not to be envied, nor are they to be underestimated - and underestimation of this is perhaps one of the things I've been guilty of prior to this year.The question to me about FedEx is not whether to invest - I'm a FedEx long, remain one, and my rating here is a bullish ""Buy"" - but when to invest. As FedEx themselves say in relevant earnings calls, if there's further geopolitical tensions and weakness, the risk for further share price pressure in FedEx is high. Consequently, the stock price could drop lower, if this was to be the case. If you consider it likely, your best bet would obviously be to wait.However, the core of my considerations in FedEx has not been challenged by another weak quarter - and that is that FedEx will be one of the companies that herald the future of logistics and freight going forward.I consider it very likely they will be, and their degree of internationalization and business across the world only confirms this - even if parts of this business are currently plagued by integration problems and efficiency.I have no intention of knowingly investing at a poor point in time, however - so to that effect, I would advise one who was interested in investing in FedEx to consider carefully where they believe the company is and is going 1-3 years from now.FedEx isn't going anywhere as a company - these coming months won't decide the be or not to be of this giant. We may see further pressure, and we may not.What is true however, is that the company is trading below recession-level valuations in terms of prospective earnings. While this may be justified given the challenges faced by the company at this time, it's also unlikely that the macroeconomic conditions will remain poor forever.This means that if you consider a turnaround in macro likely, this will in turn positively affect companies like FedEx, who will benefit from volume effects.My strategy for FedEx remains purchases in bite-sized chunks during times of relative and historical undervaluation - and it is one I will continue doing at this time.The latest buy of this company was today.Thank you for reading.At a valuation of ~10 times earnings, I consider FedEx to be a ""Buy"" - though this comes with the caution to invest in small positions, if at all. There is a degree of short-term uncertainty here, which may depress the share price further prior to a rebound - and a true recovery could take years."
4294065,20599,2019-09-29T15:00:59-04:00,FedEx revealed a drop in EPS and revenue last week.Integrating the TNT acquisition better and expanding ground delivery are its future drivers of success.The company is working to a new future with Amazon as a competitor instead of a partner.,"Every week a handful of companies release some bad news about their earnings, business line, or future endeavors. This can create a stock that is a value trap or create a possible entry point for a strong company. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) took a beating this past week. The company announced poor earnings and reduced expectations for future earnings. The stock dropped over 10% in one day and continued to slide through the end of the week.FedEx is down almost 40% over the past 12 months compared with its closest competitor, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), being up 1.9%. Its earnings estimate and revenue for next quarter have been reduced so low, it shouldn't take much for FedEx to match or beat it. In June, FedEx had warned that 2020 earnings would be coming in lower than 2019's earnings due to its International Express division. Given all the headwinds facing FedEx, that prediction came true on Sept 17. The trade war with China is a big driver in the problems facing FDX. With the interruptions to manufacturing facilities, FedEx has lost out on a large part of its business. FedEx has also finally acknowledged Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a competitor. Amazon and FedEx officially broke off their relationship this summer and that has hurt FedEx more than expected. With Amazon building a fleet of planes, vans, and sorting hubs, it's possible Amazon could offer logistics and shipping to outside businesses.Even with the lower earnings, FedEx is not quitting on investing in its business to drive efficiencies. The company is spending almost $6 billion on new aircraft and sorting hubs. Cutting cost by reducing capacity at the Express Air-shipping division including grounding older planes should help it for future growth. FedEx did note that it expects weakness to continue in the International Express division due to European sluggishness and its TNT acquisition needing more time to produce efficiencies. It is looking to push into seven days of ground delivery per week and become the low-cost, high-service provider in the short-haul market.As with any stock, there are risks involved. Given the amount of fuel consumed by such a large fleet of planes, trucks, and vans, FedEx is exposed to the gyrations in the oil market. If oil spikes, it will be felt on FedEx's bottom line. Another risk is that its investment in a turnaround plan and the acquisition of TNT do not bring the expected returns and cost savings on schedule. These are long-term plans and investors tend to focus on the short-term. Thankfully FedEx has a dividend yield of 1.77%, which looks secure, and provides investors with cash while they wait for the turnaround to take shape. The trade-war and sluggish global economy will hurt FedEx, but no more than its competitors.FedEx appears oversold at $148 a share and this looks like a good entry point. It is refocusing its business to strongly compete in the ground business and making the necessary adjustments to their Express service. Losing Amazon has certainly hurt, but it has an international and domestic shipping network that would be hard to replicate. Look to add this stock to your portfolio for potential future growth."
4292906,105409,2019-09-22T21:47:14-04:00,"FedEx's EPS decreased the third quarter in a row. The shocking part of this quarter was a negative free cash flow of -$853 mln.The forward P/E ratio, which is 12.5, is not relevant as FedEx has a lot of debt (2.1x EBITDA) and free cash flow keeps worsening.If macro conditions worsen (as most analysts expect), FedEx will be the first company in its sector to get hurt. Its margins are much weaker compared to its peers.Investors should wait how FCF will evolve in the coming quarters. If the company keeps losing money, the risk/reward is not worth it.","On September 17, FedEx (FDX) reported Q1 2020 results which were far below expectations. In fact, EPS declined 8.3% YoY. However, the recent drop got the stock to a forward P/E of 12.5, considerably lower compared to S&P's average P/E of 22.3. Consequently, one could think that this stock is getting undervalued. In this article, I will explain why this stock looks to be a 'value trap' where P/E appears to be cheap, but debt is high and free cash flow negative. This is a very bad situation which you should avoid as an investor. It looks like there are many dark clouds hanging above the company. Furthermore, I will analyse FedEx's performance compared to its peers.(Source: freightwaves.com)It looks like the company is losing its growth status as EPS declined 8.3% QoQ, the third consecutive decline in a row. This is primarily due to weakening operating margins as revenues stayed flat.(Source: FedEx Corporation)Interestingly, instead of blaming itself, management blames the macro environment, which I don't like at all:This is a big difference with its closest peers, United Parcel Service (UPS) and Expeditors International (EXPD). These companies were able to grow earnings in their last quarterly report and are only talking about 'uncertainties.'At the mid-range management guidance of $11 to $13 EPS (which was far below consensus of $14.62), forward P/E currently stands at 12.50. Contrarian investors could see this as an attractive buying point. However, one should be aware of FedEx's high debt (expected to grow to 2.1x EBITDA), declining margins (operating margins declined by 60 bps) and negative free cash flow (-$853 mln in Q1 2020). I am mostly concerned about the huge negative free cash flow. Consequently, FedEx needs to issue debt to fund the business. If this trend continues, as you could expect based on management reactions, things could get really bad for FedEx.(Source: FedEx Corporation)In this section, I provide a comparison of FedEx's operating and FCF margin with United Parcel Service and Expeditors International. I notice three things:(Data sources: FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service and Expeditors International)It looks like investing in FedEx based on its P/E ratio is not a good idea. FedEx's huge negative free cash flow in its latest earnings report is concerning. Combined with the relatively high debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.1, investing in FedEx implies taking much risk. With a further economic slowdown ahead, things could get really ugly for FedEx. I suggest waiting out to see how FCF evolves in the coming quarters. If it keeps being negative, the risk/reward is way too low."
4294861,31441,2019-10-03T13:53:26-04:00,"FDX's revenue is flat, while operating income is in serious decline.Business shipments could get worse before they get better.Sell FDX.","Source: CNBCI have been bearish on FedEx (FDX) for several years. I was certain FedEx's fortunes would fall with a decline in the U.S. economy. Though the company's financial results have not been much to write home about, its stock had been rising with broader markets. That may have changed last month. The company reported revenue of $17.05 billion, which was in-line. However, it missed on revenue. The stock fell hard and is still down 15% post-earnings.The fall in stock was justified, in my opinion. There has been a lot of happy talk from the Trump administration and various corporate CEOs. However, FedEx's management spoke candidly about the toll the trade war with China was having on its operations. Management was earnest about its expectations of weaker U.S. economic growth. It confirmed that Europe is declining faster than the U.S. However, talks of the strength of the U.S. consumer could be equivalent to whistling past the graveyard:I have been bearish on the U.S. economy for a while. However, the potential knock-on effects of the trade war threw me for a loop. If a slowdown in China's economic growth causes China to reduce imports of European products, then it could exacerbate the contraction in manufacturing in Europe. This could have wider implications. Other multinationals like General Electric (GE) or Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) could also face a slowdown in revenue from Europe.The U.S. economy has expanded for over a decade. It was bound to slow or even decline at some point. Sans more stimulus, economic contraction could be a foregone conclusion. Rail traffic is in decline, which portends businesses are shipping fewer goods and services cross country. The falloff in business activity could create headwinds for FedEx and UPS (UPS) in the future.The headwind is the impact of the global slowdown in FedEx's margins. Revenue of $17.1 billion was flat Y/Y, but the company had to work harder to maintain its revenue. Operating income of $977 million was down by high single-digits.Operating income margin was 6.1%, down from 6.7% in the year earlier period. The 60 basis point decline created a double-negative effect, which caused operating income to decline despite flat revenue growth.FedEx Express has traditionally represented about half the company's revenue. It only represented about 29% of total operating income, which implied it has lower margins than the other segments. FedEx Express's operating income of $285 million was off 27% Y/Y. A few months ago market chatter implied FedEx may have been slashing prices to fill planes. The free fall in operating income this quarter seems to support that thesis.Operating income from FedEx Ground represented 66% of the company's total operating income; it fell 5% Y/Y. Revenue from FedEx Express could get hit hardest by an economic contraction. Businesses send their most time-sensitive documents via FedEx Express and this revenue stream could turn down first. The company must then rely on FedEx Ground to pick up the slack. If operating income from FedEx Ground is also falling, then that does not bode well for the company. Most of the chatter narrative surrounds the prospects for FedEx Express. From an operating income perspective, FedEx Ground appears to be the one remaining moat and should be protected at all costs.Management expects to earn $12 per share for fiscal year 2020, less than the $15 Wall Street was expecting. The lowered guidance likely spooked investors and exacerbated the stock's decline. In my opinion, a decline in earnings was to be expected given the lingering trade war. If the trade war ends, then FedEx's earnings would likely spike in the short-term. Over the long-term I expect the global economy to remain stagnant to declining. FedEx's prospects will likely ebb and flow with the global economy.The slowdown in the global economy could further engulf FDX. The stock is down 40% Y/Y. Business shipments could get worse before they get better. Sell FDX."
4292634,104183,2019-09-20T05:33:44-04:00,"FedEx shares have a miserable day following fiscal Q1 2020 earnings, where lower guidance created a new wave of selling.The company is adversely affected by the trade war, as well as the loss of Amazon in its largest segment.There is the potential for trade relief next month, but investors shouldn’t be in a rush to buy FedEx on this.","Nearly every broker on the street cut either its rating or price target on FedEx (FDX) on Wednesday, in response to a weak set of earnings from the company and equally weak guidance. With fear surrounding the stock, Wednesday’s performance saw the worst intraday loss since 2008, which is difficult to imagine. The company has several problems at the moment, and it’s unclear how it plans to pivot. FedEx needs to address the competition headwind directly and create a more competitive offering to prevent the growth of other key players in the industry. Additionally, the company and its stock are also reliant on business conditions improving, which with PMIs having rolled over, doesn’t seem all that likely in the short-term absent a trade deal.Source: FreightWavesFedEx reported revenues of $17.05 billion, which were flat on a YOY basis. Operating income, however, fell on the same timeline to $977 million from $1.07 billion. A margin decline of 60bps for operating income also occurred, as certain costs increased. This ended up impacting the bottom line, where the company reported net income of $745 million versus $835 million last year. Chairman and CEO Frederick Smith said that the challenges experienced during the quarter were reflective of a weaker global macro environment, which is primarily the result of trade issues. In relation to the negative margin development, the company referenced the “loss of business from a large customer,” as well as a mix shift that led to higher costs and lower yields.There’s a lot to unpack here, but first I want investors to focus on guidance. The company is forecasting earnings of $10-$12/diluted share before the adjustment of the mark-to-market retirement plan factor. That’s not currently something the company is able to forecast. The company is also factoring in a 24-26% effective tax rate due to lower than expected earnings in certain international locations. With earnings lower from the previous guidance of $11-$13/diluted, there’s both a valuation concern and a broader worry that the factors independent of FedEx are going to cause earnings guidance to be cut again at the next earnings report, should trade headwinds not abate.FedEx lost Amazon back in June, as FedEx decided not to renew one of its contracts. This is due to a greater rivalry between the two companies and directly impacts the FedEx Express segment. In order to quantify the loss, FedEx estimated back in June that Amazon was less than 1.3% of company-wide revenue. That equates to roughly $884 million using 2018 revenue figures. Factoring in a potential 1-2% growth rate, we’d be looking at around $900 million loss. So, while this is only 1.3% of the company, it’s still a difficult revenue loss to replace right now considering sales are flat.In looking at where the losses actually came from this quarter, the loss of Amazon directly impacted the Express segment, with revenues falling 3% YOY. FedEx Ground, on the other hand, actually saw a nice increase, improving +8%. Yet, Freight mirrored the weakness that Express saw and also contracted 3% during the quarter. In line with what the company stated at a high level, operating expenses significantly increased. Rentals and landing fees spiked 12% YOY, completely offsetting the benefit from lower fuel costs. Additionally, purchased transportation costs increased 2%, while D&A rose 9%. This comes as salaries and employee benefits declined during the quarter by 3%.The effect for certain segments was exacerbated where expenses rose and revenues fell. FedEx Express notably saw this development, as operating income fell 27% in the segment. This is supposed to be the backbone of the business, yet with operating profit for the segment falling by nearly a third on a YOY basis, there are clear, fundamental issues with the business that should serve as a stopping point for investors. This stock carries a lot more risk than what may be let on with a well-known brand name and gearing to global e-commerce.Source: 8-KIt’s also concerning in the sense that the CEO is worried about Amazon and to imply otherwise is simply incorrect. Amazon is a very real risk factor for the company and I don’t expect that competitive pressure to go away anytime soon. He said Wednesday:If competition is only going to increase, where is the silver lining for this stock? It lies in trade tensions easing, for which there is a potential catalyst just around the corner. Next month, key meetings will take place in Washington and there is a chance that a trade war truce – whether temporary or permanent – is struck. This would restore business confidence and enable economic growth to get back on track on a global basis. I’m decently optimistic that something beneficial will result from the meetings, but there are by no means any guarantees.In the company’s earnings presentation, management included charts of the U.S. PMI and the Eurozone PMI, which both have rolled over since early 2018 and trended below 50. That’s the level that is critically watched by investors, as reading and trends above 50 are generally indicative of economic expansion. Currently, they're under 50, both indicative of contraction and a harder operating environment for FedEx. While the company can lean on e-commerce to some extent, it needs the strength of the broader domestic economy, as well as major international economies, in order to see revenue and earnings growth.Source: Investor PresentationIn terms of rate increases for the upcoming year, the company is planning to increase shipping rates by 4.9% for FedEx Express, Ground, and Home Delivery. Freight shipping rates will increase, on average, by 5.9% and will also go into the effect at the turn of the year.The stock is now down over 7% on the year and has been on a really poor run since the start of 2018. The stock peaked above $270 and has shed almost half that value now. The stock has a surprisingly low short interest at 2%, but perhaps that’s because investors believe in the name brand of the company and expect that the macro situation can’t get much worse than what it already is.I’ll say that the stock does look cheap here and that may be another point to consider heading into the talks between the U.S. and China next month. The stock trades at an EV/Sales of 0.8x and a forward P/E of 11.5x, both of which are cheap in their own right. Against the logistics industry, which sports a 1.3x EV/Sales multiple and a 15x forward earnings multiple, a company like FedEx really shouldn’t be trading at this wide of a discount, especially when they are not alone in facing difficult business conditions. EV/EBITDA multiples echo the discount, with the current multiple for FDX at 7x versus a sector average of 7.8x and an Industrials average of 8.9x.Source: StockChartsThe dividend isn’t also anything to get excited about, even after the big dip on Wednesday. The stock yields 1.5% and that’s really not much of a benefit to prospective investors. If the yield was in excess of, say, 3% or 4%, the stock would look a lot better today and there’s a larger bargaining chip to be had. The yield is exactly in line with the yield for logistics industry and falls only 30bps short of the yield for the Industrials sector, so it’s difficult to place blame on FedEx itself for not having a higher dividend for investors. Rather, investors searching for yield with beaten down stocks should likely look elsewhere.I think buying the stock here, this week, requires investors to have quite the long-term view of the company. Since I do not expect trade tensions to ease right now, I fully expect the stock to continue to reflect weakness. Talks next month between the U.S. and China may result in a reprieve of downside, but FedEx is still left with a significant competitive threat that it needs to address via a new service or new pricing scheme. While the valuation looks cheap, and does help make a case to buy the stock on the dip, the prolonged issues in the macro environment, which have weighed on business conditions, don’t foretell an optimistic outlook for the shares. I think investors need to walk away from this stock for the time being."
4291732,24823,2019-09-16T09:25:52-04:00,Earnings on Tuesday.Bouncing after a triple bottom.Guidance needs to improve.Or bottom fishing continues.,"Federal Express (FDX) has attracted bottom fishing that has formed a triple bottom on the weekly chart, and it needs improved guidance to continue any bounce up. Will the company give improved guidance on Tuesday? I don’t know, but I like to look at the fundamentals and make an educated guess before earnings. I like to be prepared to buy the bottom after earnings or wait for the next earnings report.FDX does not qualify for our model portfolio. Our most important signal is our overall fundamental/technical grade for the stock. Currently, FDX has a grade of 30 out of 100, where 50 and below is a Sell signal. No surprise that a stock testing the bottom has a Sell signal. What will be a surprise is if FDX gives improved guidance on Tuesday. That will improve our Sell signal to possibly a Hold signal, but probably not a Buy signal.Bottom fishing is tricky business, and those that bottom-fish are usually in very early before lift-off. The bottom fishers don’t wait for the real bounce to start, but the small investor can. This requires that you are prepared for any surprise and ready to act after earnings. If you have better research than is currently available in the public domain, you may act before earnings. Obviously, bottom fishers pay for and have such research. Let’s see if we can figure out why they are bottom-fishing at $149 and if they are going to be right. Obviously, if China is fixed and Amazon (AMZN) fails as a competitor, FDX may be off and running again.According to Earnings Whispers, expectations are for $3.23 vs. $3.20 consensus, and the consensus revenues are estimated at $17.1 billion. Yahoo is showing that in the last 90 days, earnings estimates dropped from $3.63 to $3.17. Next quarter dropped from $4.03 to $3.59. Full year dropped from $16.65 to $14.69. This is the guidance that is already in price. What we need to find out on Tuesday is whether this guidance holds or improves. If it holds, the bottoming process continues. If it improves, then the bounce continues. If guidance is worse, price will look for a new bottom below $149. The bottom fishers will average down. They don’t expect to catch the exact bottom. If there is a big negative surprise, the bottom fishers fold, there is exhaustion selling, and price could test $124. I think that is unlikely. More likely is a retest of $149.Let’s turn to the fundamental metrics to test the valuation of FDX, based on the existing guidance. If it is overvalued and there is no improvement in guidance, I expect the price to drop to $149. Finviz shows these metrics and even color codes them. As you can see, the FPE based on next year’s earnings is attractive. If you look over the valley of this year’s drop in earnings, and FDX can hold on to the current estimate of next year’s earnings, price might reach the old high again. That scenario would generously give FDX all of this year to fix its problems and turn around. I think the China problem will be fixed soon rather than later. A good holiday season might also help, and tariffs are being rolled back for the holidays on some items.Using this year’s earnings estimate of $14.69 gives an FPE of 11.85. Compared to the 5-year growth rate of 8.80%, that seems reasonable, giving us a PEG of 1.35. However, FDX is mature company facing disruptive competition, and that growth rate may be optimistic. Even if there is no growth, the FPE is still acceptable, but the price may never see the old high for some time.The short ratio is not exceptionally high, but if there is a positive surprise, the shorts will be squeezed and price will have a nice pop after earnings. I don’t expect that this quarter, but it could happen in future quarters.Here is the weekly chart, and it shows the profile of a bottoming stock that has failed to break out or break down. The bottom fishers are looking for a breakout. The shorts are looking for a breakdown. I don’t think we will see either of these outcomes this quarter."

Given conditions, FDX is generating no free cash flow.","If a longer title could have been created for this FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fiscal Q1 '20 earnings preview, the headline would have read, ""Expectations are low, EPS and revenue revisions remain negative, but comparisons get easier"" which might be the only bright spot currently for the Transport giant.When FedEx reports their fiscal Q1 '20 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, September 17th, 2019, Street consensus is expecting $3.17 in earnings per share on $17.07 billion in revenue for ""expected"" year over year decline in EPS of 8% on flat revenue growth.For full year, 2020, the current consensus is $14.66 in earnings on $72.3 billion in revenue growth for expected full-year drop in earnings of 6% on 4% y/y revenue growth.And right there is the issue with capital-intensive businesses like FedEx: small changes in revenue growth can lead to sharp changes in EPS, so China trade tariff issues, the resulting slowdown in Europe, and maybe some issue with spiking crude oil prices if the Yemen drone attack on Saudi's crude oil production ability can't be remedied as quickly as thought, FedEx could see a tough end to calendar '19 and their first half of fiscal '20 if these issues remain prolonged.That being, these headwinds are all well known now, and FedEx faces easier comparisons over the next 4 quarters.Source: valuation spreadsheet and IBES by Refinitiv estimatesFedEx's first pass at their fiscal '20 guidance in June '19 management noted that Express and Ground margins would continue to compress (Express margins fell 140 bps in Q4 '19) and that only Freight would show a positive Q1 '20 in terms of margin expansion.Unfortunately, for investors, Express and Ground are 90% of FDX's total revenue and operating income, respectively.Here is how the FedEx EPS and revenue revisions look:Source: IBES by RefinitivAs readers can see - like many companies in the SP 500 - consensus EPS and revenue estimates peaked for FedEx last fall, just as the SP 500 started the 20% correction we saw in Q4 '18. (See the 10/31/18 estimates highlighted in the black box.)Fiscal 2020 started on June 1, 2019, so 2020 should be the last year of negative earnings growth for FDX for this downturn, the first year of negative EPS growth since 2013.Consensus FedEx EPS and revenue estimates - and really more, importantly, the revenue estimates - are still being revised lower for FedEx. Only the most recent 2022 revenue estimates have seen an increase, and in particular note the July 31, August 31, 2019 revenue estimate consensus.FDX valuation spreadsheet updated as of 5/31/19 financial results (last quarterly rpt)Just about everything that could go wrong has gone wrong for FedEx, including the TNT hack about 18 months ago, Europe slowing, FedEx becoming the poster-child for the President and China's tariff tiff with the Huawei shipment(s), and now, with the Saudi Arabia drone attack and a big chunk of their production disabled, possibly causing a crude oil spike, Fred Smith, FedEx's Founder and CEO, must be ready to lay his head on the desk and call ""Uncle"".This being said, it's probably not a bad time to look at the shares of FedEx if you want to own a world-class brand at 8x cash flow at depressed earnings valuations.However, this could last another year too, if the President and China fail to get an interim agreement.The longer-term issue for FedEx is free cash flow generation, which was written about here and here.Nothing has really changed with capex and free cash flow for FDX, but I don't want to keep writing the same thing, quarter after quarter.Longer term, the stock looks to be bottoming, but a heavy volume trade below the December '18 low of $150 and we would reconsider the long position."
4291573,20715,2019-09-15T05:55:24-04:00,"FedEx is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.Earnings have declined in each of the last two quarters, and they are expected to decline again.The stock faces numerous layers of resistance if it is going to start a new upward trend.Sentiment toward the stock is slowly shifting to a more bearish stance, but it is far from extreme pessimism.","The world's largest overnight delivery company has seen its stock struggle over the past year and investors are hoping the next earnings report can give the stock a boost. Memphis-based FedEx (FDX) is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.17 per share on revenue of $17.09 billion. The earnings figure would mark a decline in earnings of 8.4% from the $3.46 EPS reported in the first quarter of 2019. The revenue figure came in at $17.05 billion one year ago, so analysts are looking for a slight increase.FedEx has seen its earnings decline in each of the last two quarters, declining by 15.2% in the fourth quarter and by 18.5% in the third quarter. Prior to these last few quarters, the company had been doing well with earnings growth, averaging EPS growth of 18% per year over the last three years.Even as earnings have slipped, revenues have been able to grow. The average annual growth rate over the last three years has been 11% and revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter.Looking at some other fundamental indicators for FedEx, I get some differing figures from the Wall Street Journal and Investor's Business Daily. The Journal has the return on equity at 2.9% while IBD has it at 22.2%. The Journal's figure would be considered lower than the average stock while IBD's would be slightly above average.The Journal has the profit margin at 0.77% as does Yahoo Finance. IBD has the profit margin at 7.6%. Both figures are below average compared to all other stocks.FedEx has gone on record stating that the trade war is hurting its business and here it is getting ready to report for another quarter and the trade war is still going on. The dispute between the U.S. and China has now stretched to 20 months, and it has taken a toll on many companies and FedEx is definitely one of them.Despite the decline in the stock price since the trade war started, there could be some good news on the chart. The stock recently dropped to the $150 area and seemed to find support there and it is the third time in the last year that the stock dropped to this level. The stock bounced from the $150 area last December and moved back up close to $200 in April. The stock fell again in the second half of April and through May, but once again it found support in the $150 area. The stock bounced back above the $175 level in July before the recent pullback brought it back down to the $150 area.The stock did drop a little lower on this recent pullback, falling down to a low of $147.24, but it has since bounced back. We could be looking at a double-bottom pattern forming from the low in May and the recent low. For the pattern to be completed, the stock would need to move back above the peak between the two lows. The peak in July was $177.79.While the potential double-bottom would be a positive sign, FedEx faces several potential layers of resistance if it is going to rally very much. The 52-week moving average has been moving lower for almost a year now and it could certainly act as the first layer of resistance. Looking at the past few years, FedEx hasn't really used the 52-week as support, nor has it acted as resistance.Even if the stock breaks above the recent high and the 52-week moving average, the peak from April ($197.77) could also act as a resistance point.The sentiment toward FedEx has remained rather bullish even as the company has seen earnings decline and as the stock has dropped over 40% from the high in 2018 to the recent low. There are 27 analysts following the stock and 19 have the stock rated as a ""buy"". There are seven ""hold"" ratings and one ""sell"" rating. This puts the buy percentage at 70.4% and that is right in the middle of the average range. I wrote about FedEx ahead of the earnings report back in March as well and at that time there were 24 ""buy"" ratings and four ""hold"" ratings, so we have seen the buy percentage drop in the last six months.The short interest ratio is at 2.4 currently and that is slightly below the average short interest ratio compared to all other stocks. The ratio was at 2.23 in March, so it has inched up a little in the last six months, but it is still skewed to the bullish side.The put/call ratio is at 1.16 currently with 87,793 puts open and 75,991 calls open. The ratio is slightly higher than average, and it is higher than it was in June or in March when the last two earnings reports have come out. In both of those cases, the ratio was just under 1.0. The fact that the ratio is slightly higher than average and has increased in the last six months indicates there is an increasing amount of pessimism being displayed by option traders.None of the sentiment indicators are indicating extreme pessimism, but they have all shifted to slightly more pessimistic readings. This could mean that overall expectations are lower heading into the first quarter earnings report and that could be a good thing for the stock. When expectations are lowered, the hurdle becomes easier to clear and the chances of a positive surprise increase.I am not ready to take a bullish stance on FedEx. The declining earnings and below-average management efficiency measurements are concerns for me. There is also the matter of the chart and all of the various resistance levels the stock will face as it tries to start a new upward trend.I do find it encouraging that the various sentiment indicators are moving to more skeptical levels, but they have a long way to go to reach extreme levels of pessimism.The trade war continues to linger over FedEx and will until it is resolved. Even if the trade war is resolved, we could see the global economic slowdown continue and that will certainly hurt a transportation company like FedEx. Personally I'm not convinced that a trade deal is going to end the slowdown, it will help, but I'm not sure it will be enough to stave off the next recession.There are too many negative factors for FedEx to make me a long-term bull. Sure, we could see a little boost after earnings, but the earnings report would have to be incredibly strong to halt the downward momentum in the stock, and I just don't think that is going to happen in the current economic environment.Because of the support at the $150 level, I think it is difficult to make a bearish call, but if the stock were to break $150, the next layer of support is down in the $120 range. At this time, I consider myself neutral on FedEx."
4272072,31441,2019-06-25T15:48:27-04:00,FDX reports earnings after-hours.Market chatter suggests FDX could cut prices to keep its planes filled.Declining prices could hurt margins and sentiment.Sell FDX.,"Source: CNBCFederal Express (FDX) reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. Analysts expect the company to deliver revenue of $17.88 billion and EPS of $4.93. The revenue estimate implies 5% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:The U.S. economy has expanded for over a decade. Was the expansion organic or was it stimulus-induced? I do not believe the economy can grow in perpetuity. If the GOP tax cuts marked the end of government stimulus for a while, then the economy has likely peaked. Rail traffic is in decline, which portends businesses are shipping fewer goods and services cross country. If FedEx does not exhibit strong growth this quarter or if management gives weak guidance, then it could be another data point suggesting the economy is slowing. A decline in mailings of business material or sensitive documents could portend a fall-off in business activity.In its most recent quarter, FedEx generated total revenue of $17.0 billion, up 3% Y/Y. Revenue from FedEx Express fell 1%; revenue from FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight both grew in the high single-digit range. FedEx Express was negatively affected by lower international priority and international domestic package revenue. FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight revenue were driven by higher volume and higher yields.FedEx Express represents over 50% of total revenue. The segment could be a proxy for business activity since businesses oftentimes rely on FedEx for their most-sensitive documents. If the segment falters this quarter, then it could portend the next recession is near. Market chatter also suggests the company could be slashing prices to fill up its planes:This could imply that pricing for FedEx Express could tumble. Whether the company can offset the price cuts with more volume remains to be seen. We also do not know if UPS (UPS) will respond with price cuts of its own. This could lead to a spiraling down of prices in what could be a slumping business environment.The company's total costs did not rise in concert with its 3% revenue gain. Salaries and benefits actually fell 1% Y/Y and represented about 38% of total operating costs. I expect management to try to contain costs going forward and this could be a large expense bucket the company can control. Expenses for purchased transportation rose 8% Y/Y due to higher volumes across all transportation segments, increased rates, and increased fuel costs. Tight labor markets could be driving rates higher. The fall out was that EBITDA grew 7% on a 50 basis point increase in EBITDA margin.If the company offers discounts to online merchants, then FedEx could potentially drive more volume at lower rates, while the costs of purchased services are rising. I expect margins to be in line this quarter. However, margins for the second half of 2019 could shrink. This is important as it could potentially impact FedEx's valuation. With an enterprise value of $57 billion, FDX trades at just over 8x EBITDA. The stock appears to be fairly valued, assuming it can maintain EBITDA at current levels. That could be difficult to do if its pricing power declines.The economy appears to have peaked, which does not bode well for FDX. The stock is down over 25% Y/Y. Weak guidance could cause FDX to fall further. Sell FDX."
4293000,99986,2019-09-23T10:52:12-04:00,"FedEx reported earnings last week, and quarterly revenue growth rates have decelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter to 0% for fiscal Q1.The stock continues to trade below all of its key weekly moving averages, and has been unable to reclaim its 40-week moving average for most of 2019.I see FedEx as an avoid given its lethargic technicals and weakening growth metrics.","FedEx (FDX) reported their fiscal Q1 2020 results last week, and the initial reaction should be of little surprise to investors. The company's growth rates have been decelerating for nearly a year now, and a miss on revenues from sluggish estimates is a recipe for further share price weakness. Forecasts for Q1 revenues were $17.3 billion, and FedEx came in 2% lower at $17.0 billion. From an earnings per share [EPS] standpoint, we also have the third quarter in a row of negative year-over-year growth. While value investors continue to clamor about buying below $170.00, I don't see any rush to buy FedEx stock. Earnings revisions continue to be negative, revenue growth rates are expected to decelerate again next quarter, and the stock remains in a bear market. The next crucial support level for FedEx sits at $128.00 if this current support at $151.00 breaks down on a weekly close. I see FedEx as an Avoid based on its weakening fundamentals and would be using 15% plus rallies to exit the stock. (Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com)Just two months ago I wrote on FedEx and discussed how the company was cheap for a reason. The company was seeing decelerating growth in both EPS and quarterly revenues and was one of the worst-performing S&P-100 (OEF) stocks of 2019. Typically, laggards continue to remain laggards, especially if there are no positive fundamental developments on the horizon. In FedEx's case, the company had the odds stacked against them going into this quarter, with revenue likely to decelerate from 3% to 2% unless they were able to beat massively on their numbers. The chart below from my article in early July shows what I was trying to convey in my article. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While some investors may argue that a deceleration from 3% growth in quarterly revenues down to 0% this quarter is not a big deal, it is a big deal when compared to the past two years. As the below chart and table I've built shows, FedEx has seen quarterly revenue growth erode from low double-digits to non-existent growth in the span of just 18 months. This is a significant headwind for earnings per share growth as it's near impossible to achieve sustainable earnings per share growth without help from the top-line. The below chart shows that not only have quarterly revenue growth rates fallen off a cliff, but the two-quarter average for revenue growth rates is tracking similarly. The two-quarter average (white line) for revenue growth is designed to smooth out any lumpy quarters and provide for a more precise idea of what the real trend in revenue growth is. Neither of these figures is trending higher, and two-quarter average revenue growth is expected to drop to 0% next quarter. FedEx's fiscal Q2 2020 revenue estimates are sitting at $17.9 billion, and this will translate to less than 1% growth vs. the fiscal Q2 2019 figure of $17.8 billion. This is not ideal for the company, as this shows that the deceleration in revenue growth is persisting.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Looking at earnings per share growth below, we can see that FY-2020 earnings per share are expected to be down 5% year-over-year, and then make a new high for FY-2021 based on estimates. However, the deceleration in the growth is blatantly obviously below. FedEx went from growing annual earnings per share at high double-digit rates per year to a slowdown to 2% expected for FY-2019. The new high in FY-2021 at $16.24, with 10% growth is only coming after the first negative year-over-year growth in EPS in the past decade. For this reason, this double-digit bump in FY-2021 is much less impressive. Based on this, FedEx is nowhere near the same stock it was during 2014 through 2018 when it was a medium-growth large-cap.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)As we can see from the below charts, earnings estimates have been revised lower slightly based on this miss. FY-2020 annual EPS estimates have gone from $14.73 to $14.69, while FY-2021 estimates are down nearly 1% from $16.35 to $16.24. Just as positive earnings estimate revisions tend to lead to medium-term price appreciation as I pointed out in Barrick Gold (GOLD) in July, they can be a headwind when they are negative revisions as we see with FedEx. Based on the company's lowered guidance, it's likely these earnings revisions will track lower over the next couple of weeks. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)Fedex's CEO Frederick Smith FedEx blamed the weak quarter on ""a weakening global macro environment driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty"". While these points are true, the company was clearly too upbeat about the resolution of a trade war. One of the more issues contributing to revenue softness is Amazon's (AMZN) move from a partner of FedEx to a rival with its creation and expansion of its own delivery network. Amazon's Delivery Services Partners Program, discussed initially in Q2 of last year, allows entrepreneurs to run their own businesses fulfilling Amazon orders. FedEx discussed last quarter that that Amazon only accounted for 1.3% of its total revenue, and this would only be a minor issue that would correct itself in FY-2021. While this remains to be seen, this additional loss of revenue has come at a time when FedEx is seeing softness already. (Source: Company Slide Deck)Outside of the Amazon partnership loss, global trade disputes have affected manufacturing in Europe and Asia, and this has slowed shipping demand. As we can see from the company's slide deck above, Eurozone Manufacturing PMI is at multi-year lows. This is no help to the company as their China business has also been affected by Chinese exports to the U.S. declining every single month of 2019. Finally, industrial demand has been weak with inventory build and increased trade tensions. All these factors are contributing negatively during a period when FedEx was already coming up against tough comparisons from its 26% FY-2018 earnings growth.On the positive side, the company is working on new initiatives and has launched Seven Day Service with FedEx Ground. FedEx Extra Hours should also differentiate them from some of their competitors as it allows them to take orders later in the day, and still have them delivered the next day. Finally, the company just announced a new strategic partnership with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). This will help Dick's get product to their customers faster from their e-commerce business through ground commercial, home delivery, and express services.While FedEx may have sandbagged their numbers a little this quarter after five consecutive misses, even a beat would still likely see a contraction in earnings growth for FY-2020. The fact that a continued deceleration in revenue growth accompanies this contraction in earnings is not ideal. With FedEx needing capital for their long-term vision of taking advantage of e-commerce growth and increasing facilities to gain share in the FedEx Ground oversized package network, lower costs is not an option. For this reason, earnings growth is likely to remain pressured for FY-2020 and FY-2021 as it's very difficult to grow earnings per share when revenues are flat, and costs to integrate new plans remain high. An escalation in the Trade War would have further negative ramifications for the stock.Looking at the weekly chart below, we can see that FedEx broke down from its $227.00 - $274.00 base in 2018, and is now trying to build a new base for most of 2019 in the $160.00 - $198.00 range. This is the third test of the bottom of this base, and triple bottoms rarely hold. Usually, the more often a level gets tested, the more likely it is to see follow-through in that direction. A weekly close below $151.00 would increase the potential we may need to see a test of strong support at $128.00.From a trend following perspective, the stock's 20-month moving average has rolled over, and we continue to see FedEx trading beneath its key moving averages. I would expect rallies to the upper half of this base to be sold into, barring a trade war resolution.(Source: TC2000.com)While the S&P-500 (SPY) continues to hang out near its highs, FedEx remains a laggard and has been unable to reclaim its key moving averages. I pointed out in July that avoiding the stock was a good idea, and that it would be best to take advantage of sharp rallies of 15% to sell. I believe this is still the best course of action as the fundamentals remain weak, and the technical picture has deteriorated further. Many value investors continue to pound the table on FedEx, but a 1.7% yield is hardly enough to entice me to be paid to wait. I don't see any reason to go bottom-fishing here. The current P/E ratio of 11 is undoubtedly cheap, but the stock remains cheap for a reason. It is not unusual for companies with flat earnings growth and flat revenues to trade at single-digit P/E's as stocks rarely stop on fair valuation. Instead, they overshoot in both directions.I see FedEx as an Avoid at this time, but value investors may get a lower risk entry closer to multi-year support at $128.00. For now, I see the reward to risk as closer to balanced at current levels, and I believe it's likely that 15-20% rallies will get sold into. We saw heavy institutional selling after earnings from $155.00 with the highest daily volume in five years, and this selling pressure likely will persist if the stock rallies back near $170.00."

The deal may be a harbinger of more acquisitions to counteract slowing global trade flows.","FedEx (FDX) announced it has agreed to acquire Cargex for an undisclosed amount.Cargex operates as an international freight forwarding company in Colombia.With the deal, FDX gains an experienced logistics firm as it seeks to counteract a slowdown in global trade with a deeper reach into international markets.Bogotá, Colombia-based Cargex was founded over 25 years ago as an international perishables and dry cargo freight forwarding company.Management is headed by General Manager Pablo Torres, who has been with the firm since 2009 and was previously Project Development Manager at G Torres Vengas e Hijos.Below is an overview video of the company’s marketing campaign:Source: CargexAccording to a market research report by JOC.com, the global logistics industry is worth over $160 billion annually.In the Latin America region, issues with shipping and logistics have held back the development of the e-commerce sector in the area as in some places, packages could take between 45 to 60 days to arrive.According to another report by ASIL, it often takes up to 32 days to import materials into the region of which 28 days take for the products to be sorted through in-country customs and customs brokers.Due to rapid growth of the business-to-consumer [B2C] e-commerce sector and a strong business-to-business market, demand for improved logistics and shipping services in the Latin America region is expected to grow appreciably in the period ahead.The research firm BI Intelligence estimates that 90% of North America’s fleets, or about 180 million vehicles will be monitored through the Internet of Things by 2020 with Latin America following fast behind.FedEx didn’t disclose the acquisition price and terms and didn’t file a Form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of May 31, 2019, the firm had $826 million in cash and equivalents and $21.1 billion in total liabilities, of which $17.3 billion was long-term debtFree cash flow for the twelve months ended May 31, 2019, was $60.0 million.In the past 12 months, FDX’s stock price has dropped 35.0% vs. the U.S. Logistics industry’s fall of 14.2% and the broader overall U.S. market’s drop of 0.02%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Simply Wall StreetEarnings surprises have been positive in eight of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaManagement sentiment in recent earnings calls has dropped significantly since mid-2018, according to the linguistic sentiment analysis shown here:Source: SentieoFDX is acquiring Cargex to enhance its operations between Colombia and Miami.As Udo Lange of FedEx stated in the deal announcement:By acquiring Cargex, FedEx gains expertise on the export management of perishable goods, an important export from the Colombian region.FedEx is facing challenging economic conditions, with reduced international revenue growth as a function of the slowdown in global trade volumes.Although the deal for Cargex was likely a small one, it shows management’s focus on broadening its reach into new markets by acquiring logistics firms that can ‘feed’ new shipping business through its network.I expect to see additional targeted deals like this as FedEx contends with global trade headwinds and seeks to generate growth."
4271908,32001,2019-06-24T20:39:59-04:00,"The China trade and tariff issue has caused supply chain re-evaluation and re-routing. Those trade issues have impacted the Transports like FedEx.With the dividend and Amazon announcement, along with China trade/tariff worries, there is a a lot of bad news baked into the current stock price.The fiscal 2020 EPS growth expectation has fallen from ""mid-teens"" 5 quarters ago to just 5% ""pre-earnings release.""Technically, the stock put in a nice ""double-bottom"" in the low $150s in late December '18 and May '19.FedEx is probably - conservatively - undervalued by at least 25%, and it could be more depending on TNT continued cost reduction, Express margins, China tariffs and free-cash-flow generation.","FedEx Corp (FDX) reports its fiscal Q4 '19 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, June 25th, 2019.Analyst consensus - per IBIS by Refinitiv - is expecting $4.85 in earnings per share on $17.78 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth in revenue of 3% but an 18% decline in earnings per share.FDX (the stock) is down from a high of $270 in January '18, when the S&P 500 first started to crack around Fed Funds rate increases, worries over the increasingly unfriendly China trade and tariff rhetoric (much of which was probably needed) and slowing global growth metrics.Since that peak near $270, and using FDX's closing price of $162 as of Friday, June 21, 2019, the stock is down roughly 40% in nearly 18 months, and the S&P 500 has returned a roughly flat to +5% total return in the same time period.The recent dividend announcement where the FedEx Board came out and left the dividend unchanged was not a big surprise, since anyone who has followed the company, stock and sector knows that capital-intensive sectors aren't big free cash flow generators (Micron (MU), which also reports Tuesday night after the bell, is a classic example as well), and that excess cash is usually directed to big repurchase plans rather than dividends for these cyclical stocks. (Here is the specific Seeking Alpha article where the FDX dividend was referenced and I noted where readers should not expect a big dividend from the transport giant based on free cash flow.)Forward EPS and revenue revisions:(Source: Current estimates sourced from IBES by Refinitiv. Historicals from internal financial and valuation spreadsheet.)Fiscal '19 ends with this earnings results release.Hate to beat a dead horse, but the attached is the dissection of FedEx's cash flow statement (part of it) which shows the trends in the company's cash and free cash flow over the last few years:(Source: Internal valuation and financial modeling spreadsheet)The modeling spreadsheet goes all the way back to the late 1990s, and what is interesting is that while FDX's revenue has more than doubled from $7-8 billion to the current $17, $18, $20 billion estimates, the free cash flow coverage of net income is still well below 1x and hasn't improved that much (hence the dividend news and policy).Fred Smith, who is one of America's great CEOs and founders, has talked about free cash flow and said ""It's coming,"" but the TNT hack and now China and the global slowdown have hampered it further.Alan Graf, the CFO, has been in his position forever, so the upper management team is solid - although there have been changes in some of the division leaders the past few years.Even with the cost reductions several years ago, free cash flow coverage never really improved, thus it tells you FedEx is a very capital-intensive business and shrinking the cost structure is not easy.(Here are other articles written on FDX's cash flow: here, here and here.)Down from the $270 high in January '18, FedEx is thought to be undervalued, but the question remains: is the margin of safety high enough?The April '19 high for FDX was close to $200, so some skittish Seeking Alpha readers may want to wait until the stock breaks out of this trading range and makes a higher high (kinda like my undergraduate years). But at that point, I think investors will need to see revenue and earnings growth consistent with a growing global economy and no longer any worries about China trade issues.The focus will be on Express and Ground margins (probably) during the call, but here is what else will be looked for in the conference call notes:A heavy volume trade below $150 and we would likely be out of the position. However, at its current price and if the global supply chain rerouting can be taken advantage of by FedEx and if TNT and the European economy start to show some life, and if we can see some free cash flow generation that isn't temporary, the stock represents good value here for a horizon of a couple of years at least."
4273945,99986,2019-07-08T17:40:55-04:00,"While FedEx may appear cheap at a P/E ratio of near 11, I believe the stock to be cheap for a reason.The stock broke down from a 10-year uptrend earlier this year, and has been unable to recover since in the midst of declining fund ownership.I believe there are much better opportunities out there, and am avoiding FedEx for this reason.","While FedEx (FDX) might be a conviction buy from the value community judging from recent analysis, I believe that upside is limited, given the eroding fundamental picture and weak technicals. While the S&P-500 (SPY) has trotted more than 15% higher since its December lows, FedEx is sitting with a flat year-to-date return and has not participated in the slightest. This is a significant change of character for the stock, as the stock outperformed the general market in almost every year from 2013 through 2017. On the fundamental front, earnings per share are now growing with a decelerating trend in quarterly revenue growth, and I do not believe this to be sustainable. Typically, in these situations, earnings per share either top out within the next year or two or decelerates significantly. Based on these two negative headwinds, I believe the upside is limited in the stock, and it will be a market performer at best.While conventional wisdom might assume that funds are salivating over the recent weakness in FedEx and scooping up shares at break-neck speed, the opposite is happening. The number of funds holding FedEx topped in Q2 2018 and has been on a steady decline since. The most recent quarter saw 250 funds shed the stock from their portfolios, and this is the most significant single quarter drop in years. While the big money and institutions are not always right, it rarely pays to fight them at the onset of a new trend. Just as one would be crazy to short a stock with accelerating fund ownership from a period of stagnant fund moves, looking to buy a stock while funds are suddenly switching from net buyers to net sellers rarely pays off intermediate-term either. As we see from the below chart I've built, fund ownership was trending up from 2017 through 2018, but now has begun a new downtrend in Q1 with three consecutive quarterly drops, and a new 2-year low in fund ownership.(Source: Investors.com, Author's Chart)So what's the catalyst for funds becoming net sellers of FedEx? Let's take a look at annual earnings per share and quarterly revenue growth below.As can be seen from the chart I've built below of annual earnings per share, FedEx has been a behemoth growth company for a large cap of its size. The company has managed to put up nearly 18% annual earnings growth rates over the past five year period, but this growth is finally beginning to slow to a halt. FY-2020 earnings per share are expected to drop year over year, and while FY-2021's earnings are estimated to put in a new all-time high at $16.35, this will translate to growth of less than 3% per year from FY-2018's $15.31 in EPS, to FY-2021's estimate for $16.35. This is a material drop-off in a prior double-digit growth rate, and there is no reason the company would command the same P/E ratio it did in the 2013 through 2017 period with an exceptional growth rate.This slowdown in annual earnings per share can be attributed to the weakening global trade backdrop, and the fact that FedEx has dropped Amazon (AMZN) from its Express business as a customer. While FedEx has stated that Amazon only accounts for about 1.3% of its total revenue and that this should trend correct itself in FY-2021, this is still a minor blow. The bigger unresolved worry is that China has considered black-listing FedEx after misrouting packages directed to Huawei. Clearly, the company's bets on international trade are not playing out as expected.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table & Chart)Moving over to quarterly revenue growth, we can also see a clear sign of deceleration emerging. During the 2016 and 2017 period, earnings growth was being fueled by reasonably up-trending and robust revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. However, since Q4 2018, revenue growth has flattened out and is now beginning to decelerate quite a bit. The prior average year-over-year growth rate for Q4 2017 through Q4 2018 was 9.8% (five-quarter average). The current year-over-year growth rate from Q3 2018 through to Q3 2019 estimates is 5.6%, and this will likely to decline to as low as 3.5% as the stronger Q3 2018 and Q4 2018 quarters roll off the back-end. Earnings growth with decelerating revenue growth is rarely sustainable long-term and based on this; it is hard to imagine the company's decelerating earnings growth rate re-accelerating any time soon. One silver lining is that the company's initiatives to partner with Dollar General (DG) and Walgreens (WBA) may help to boost revenues and offset the medium-term headwind of the canceled Amazon contract. The other silver lining is that FedEx has recently announced seven-day delivery year-round, and is ramping up efforts in its Ground business. The company stated on the call that they expected volume and revenue growth to remain strong. Whether both these initiatives will pay off remains to be seen.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table & Chart)Based on the eroding fundamental strength, and the fact that the market tends to look forward 18 months, it is not difficult to understand why FedEx is out of favor here. For funds to fall back in love with the stock, investors are going to want to see an acceleration in quarterly revenue growth on a year-over-year basis again to the high single-digit levels. Barring this, it is possible that FY-2021's projection for $16.35 in annual earnings per share may mark a short-term top (2-3 years) in their earnings trend.While the fundamental picture is no longer nearly as rosy as it was in the past five-year period, the technical picture is also showing signs of long-term weakness. FedEx broke down from a $227.00 - $275.00 box late last year and is now trying to build out a new box between $150.00 and $200.00. The stock's uptrend line from the 2009 lows was broken as of Q4 2018, and any rallies up to the underside of this trend line will likely be met with selling pressure if they do occur. Also, all of FedEx's weekly moving averages have rolled over, and this will provide a headwind. All through the 2010 through 2017 period, FedEx enjoyed a tailwind as it traded above a flat or increasing intermediate-term weekly moving average (green line). This moving average has finally flipped to negative for several weeks in a row and may be new resistance for the stock near the $200.00 level now. Yes, a trade up to $200.00 is certainly a nice gain for a stock currently trading at $162.00. Having said that, outside of a powerful market rally or a material positive change in FedEx's fundamentals, I believe this may be the ceiling for the stock for the next 12 months. I prefer to trade in stocks where there are limited overhead supply and technical ceilings, and for this reason, I see hundreds of better opportunities out there. If I were holding FedEx, I would be inclined to dump the stock as it approached the $200.00 level and take my profits while I have them.(Source: TC2000.com)Zooming in on the weekly chart, we can see that we have pretty clear resistance at $200.00 where the stock was rejected in April, as well as strong resistance at $227.00. The $227.00 level is prior support which is likely to become new resistance for the stock, as well as the underside of the stock's broken 10-year uptrend line.(Source: TC2000.com)While FedEx was the right stock to park in one's portfolio for the past decade, I believe the stock's market out-performer days are over, and it will now be relegated to the market performer or market under-performer heap. While buys in the $160.00 range may work, it does not fit any of my strategies currently. There are far too many healthy stocks in up-trends out there with steady revenue growth to bother with FedEx here. The fact that FedEx cannot even find a bid with the market's recent 5-week resurgence off the June low is typically not a good sign. As long as the FedEx bulls defend $150.00 on a weekly close, they may have a shot at a run back towards the $200.00 level. However, if the $150.00 level is lost on a weekly close, this increases the probabilities that the stock may need to visit the $130.00 level, which is the next crucial support. An end to the trade war would certainly provide a decent boost for the stock, but there's a good chance the stock will get rejected at its broken support level near $200.00. If I was long the stock from current levels, I would be looking to take advantage 15% plus rallies to exit the majority of my position."
4271534,103501,2019-06-21T14:11:49-04:00,"FedEx has been kicked to the curb as of late and is trading off of 52-week lows at only a 10.7x forward P/E.FedEx's strong operations and service offerings have allowed the company to achieve an average ROE and ROIC of 12.7% and 9.0%, respectively, over the past decade.Share buybacks at the company do not look sustainable with much of the recent decade's repurchases being financed by ever-rising debt.","FedEx (FDX) has been beaten up a lot over the past year due to slowing global economic growth, the U.S. trade war with China where FedEx has been caught in the middle with Huawei, and not to mention a slow and expensive integration of their 2016 acquisition of TNT Express. All of this has made FedEx look like a good value play right now, trading at only 10.7x forward earnings, based on the $15.50 EPS midpoint of management's guidance for FY 2019 provided in their Q3 earnings release. With the company reporting Q4 and full-year results on June 25, it might be time for investors to get acquainted with the name.Data by YChartsFedEx reported a pretty solid Q3 for FY 2019 with continued revenue growth aided by tailwinds from the growth of e-commerce despite a slow-growing global economy. Revenues for the quarter were up 3.0%Sourced from FedEx's Q3 earnings releaseManagement forecast FY 2019 guidance of EPS $15.10-15.90 before year-end MTM retirement plan accounting adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration expenses among other non-recurring expenses. Higher operating costs are impacting results, and weakening global economic conditions were also mentioned a few times on the call.FedEx's strong operations and service offerings have allowed the company to achieve an average return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) of 12.7% and 9.0%, respectively, over the past decade which includes the dark days after the financial crisis. This average level of profitability is right around my rule of thumb, seeking 15% ROE and 9% ROIC, allowing me to be confident that, in my opinion, the company is able to maintain and continue to increase its intrinsic value over a business cycle.Source data from MorningstarOn the growth side, book value per share has grown from $45.80 in 2009 to $76.35, which, when combined with the dividends paid out from equity, has an average growth of 8.2% annually and supports the ROE and ROIC averages.And, the growth is not about to stop here. As stated by their CEO Fred Smith on the Q3 conference call, FedEx is targeting a 5-year compound average growth rate of 17% based on the midpoint of adjusted FY 2019 guidance and a long-term EPS growth rate of 10-15%. In the U.S. market alone, the company expects the parcel market to double in size to reach 100 million packages per day by 2026.While financial leverage has grown significantly at FedEx over the past decade, the company remains appropriately financed with financial leverage currently at 2.74x and their interest coverage ratio a healthy 8.80 for FY 2018. Financial leverage is extra important when considering an investment in a cyclical company. The company looks to have made a notable shift in their capital structure around 2013, with share repurchases being financed by debt issuance, and this trend got taken up a notch in 2015-2016 when they acquired Dutch-based TNT Express for $4.8B with debt financing. FedEx's level of financial leverage is well above what was seen during the 2008 recession, and as such, investors should expect a larger hit to earnings if global growth were to slow dramatically.Source data from MorningstarThe company's share count has fallen around 1.5% annually over the past decade as management has included share repurchases as a key part in its capital budget. I always like to see share buybacks from management, as it shows capital budget discipline and faith in the long-term prospects for the business. However, it does seem that much of these share repurchases have not been made with free cash flows but were sadly financed by issuing debt.Probably, the most worrying thing that I noticed while looking through FedEx's financials was the significant capital expenditure needs of the company. We are past the days of the cheap courier pigeon, and today's delivery companies need an expensive (and quickly depreciating) fleet of aircraft, trucks, and delivery vans to run in sync with their state-of-the-art sorting and distribution centers. Over the past decade, FedEx has spent, on average, 89% of its cash flow from operations on capital expenditures each year.Source data from MorningstarWhile some of this spending might be attributable to not only growth but also after 2016, the integration and upgrades to TNT Express's distribution network, this does not leave much room for cash flow making its way to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks. If we aggressively take the lower 83% capital expenditures spending rate from 2009 to 2015 before the TNT Express acquisition, in an attempt to capture long-run capital expenditures after the business is fully integrated, this would still only leave 17% for shareholders. With 3-year average cash flow from operations around $5.5B, this would represent only $935M of cash flow left over for shareholders and imply a measly 2.2% free cash flow yield based on the current $43.4B market cap of FedEx. Of course, some could argue that much of this CapEx spending is driving high organic growth, and a no-growth sustainable business would spend significantly less. Either way, I would not expect huge growth in the dividend and share repurchases to continue in the medium term.When looking at steady growth companies such as FedEx, a good tool to use is legendary investor Peter Lynch's PEG ratio. To get an idea of how FedEx's market valuation compares to competitors United Postal Services (UPS) and Deutsche Post (OTCPK:DPSGY), I have placed them all side by side, comparing them based on forward P/Es and 10-year growth rates.As can be seen, FedEx's forward P/E ratio and PEG ratios are a lot lower relative to competitors. UPS is the slowest growing expensive, based on ratios, and could have less space to grow given that it is the biggest. FedEx's revenue growth of 5.6% over the past decade is well above the competition, but astute investors must remember that some of that growth has been bought. The more conservative PEG Revenue of 1.9x right below Peter Lynch's rule of thumb of being under 2x (a PEG ratio over 2 suggests that earnings growth is already built into the price).I also always like to examine the relationship between average ROE and price to book value. This relationship is especially important for cyclical companies and something I consider similar to Shiller's CAPE ratio but a little simpler to calculate, in my opinion. It examines the average ROE over a business cycle and adjusts that ROE for the price an investor would be currently paying for the company's book value or equity per share.With FedEx earning an average ROE of 12.7% over the past decade and the shares currently trading at a price to book value of 2.2 when the price of their shares is $166.50, this would yield an adjusted ROE of 5.7% for an investor's equity at that $166.50 purchase price, if history repeats itself. This is below the 9% that I like to see, but adding a conservative 3% growth rate to represent the company growing alongside GDP could increase this potential total return up to 8.7%.From the Q3 conference call, I also enjoyed management's discussion about the media's focus surrounding ""last mile delivery"" with little mention about the significance of the first few thousand miles that many packages have to travel. As stated on the call, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represents less than 1.3% of FedEx's total revenue, and management would not consider a vertical integration by Amazon a threat. FedEx's sophisticated global footprint provides a wide moat, in my opinion, which has resulted in sticky complex customer relationships that would be very difficult for new entrants to replicate.FedEx has been beaten up of late and looks like a good value relative to its peer group with some of the lower P/E and PEG ratios at 10.7x P/E and 0.6 10-year earnings PEG, respectively. Investors should not be expecting the recent share repurchases of the past few years to continue as much of them have been financed with debt issuance, which could be nearing a limit soon. Overall, though, I have added FedEx to my portfolio over the last month and will hold it as I wait for sunnier times in the global economy when someone is willing to pay a premium for this critical global behemoth.If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more of my work, click the follow button at the top of the page to receive notifications when I post a new article!"
4271974,104980,2019-06-25T10:26:30-04:00,"While FedEx recently announced a dividend freeze, this was a prudent move in the wake of uncertainty, and FedEx will likely resume dividend increases in 2020 or 2021.Despite the risks, I believe FedEx is positioning itself well for the future.In addition to its strong business, FedEx is also trading at a 12% discount to fair value.Between the 1.6% starting yield, conservative 8-9% earnings growth, and 1.3% valuation multiple expansion, it's reasonable to conclude FedEx will deliver 10.9-11.9% annual total returns over the next decade.","One of the most important lessons I have recently learned as a dividend growth investor, is that while a little bit of yield is important, I can't forget to include growth companies in my dividend ""growth"" portfolio.When we consider that my portfolio's weighted average yield currently hovers near 5%, it's clear that the first couple of years of my DGI journey have overemphasized current income over dividend growth.Upon paying for the rest of undergrad and using capital for purposes of establishing an emergency fund and paying for a car, I'll be making it a priority in 2020 for myself to focus more on investing in companies that I believe have a high likelihood of delivering rapid earnings and dividend growth, but that generally have lower starting yields.One company that I believe fits the above profile is FedEx (FDX). Although I don't currently own FedEx and don't intend to initiate a position in the company likely until next year (when I'll have funds available to begin seriously investing again), I'll be discussing the reasons why I intend to add the company to my portfolio at some point in the future, and why now is an appropriate time for others to consider doing so.Those reasons include the company's safe dividend and very promising long-term dividend growth profile, the long runway for growth, solid management team, and appealing current stock price for the long-term investor. I'll then wrap up by offering my expected annual total returns over the next 10 years.As a dividend growth investor, the safety and growth profile of a company's dividend is very important to me. We'll begin by discussing the safety of FedEx's dividend, which we'll assess by examining its EPS payout ratio.While I typically prefer to analyze both the EPS payout ratio and the FCF payout ratio, I am excluding that from my analysis of FedEx due to FedEx's negative FCF as it seeks to expand upon its delivery infrastructure in the years ahead to keep up with an anticipated increase in the demand for package delivery.In its previous fiscal year, FedEx generated $16.79 in diluted GAAP EPS against $2.60 in dividends paid out during that time, for a safe payout ratio of 15.5%.For the fiscal year 2019 results that will be reported on June 25, FedEx is guiding for a midpoint diluted GAAP EPS figure of $15.50 ($15.10-$15.90 a share) against dividends of $2.60, for a payout ratio of 16.8%.In viewing the payout ratio of FedEx, it is clear that the company's dividend is safe.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsBased upon the data above, it should be no surprise that Simply Safe Dividends and I are in agreement that FedEx's low dividend payout makes the company's dividend reasonably safe.The next logical inquiry an investor would have is what future dividend growth will resemble, which leads us into the next point.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsWhile the dividend growth of the past could technically continue with the company's very low payout ratio, I don't predict that will happen. Instead, I foresee the company's dividend growth exceeding its earnings growth by just a bit over the next 10 years, resulting in an expansion in the payout ratio from around 15% to 25-30%.When we factor in those results, it is likely that FedEx will deliver dividend growth in the ballpark of 15% over the next decade, and that will then taper off to a high single-digit dividend growth rate beyond the next decade.My above dividend growth estimates are supported by the fact that Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq are forecasting FedEx's earnings to grow by 8.8% and 12.8% over the next 5 years, respectively.I would tend to favor the Yahoo Finance growth estimate over the more rosy Nasdaq estimate on the basis of being overly conservative rather than too optimistic. While the company delivered annual earnings growth of 17% over the past 5 years, any downturn in the economy in the next couple years would heavily weigh on the company's financial results.Next, we'll examine why I believe FedEx will manage to grow its earnings by the high single digits in the years ahead.Image Source: FedEx 2019 Roadshow Investor PresentationFedEx provides transportation, e-commerce and business services in over 220 countries and territories across the globe, linking more than 99% of the world's GDP.The company's 450,000 team members and automation technology sort and process an absolutely mind-boggling 15 million shipments on a daily basis, while the company also possesses 679 aircraft and over 180,000 motorized vehicles.Simply put, FedEx is the other member of the logistics duopoly with its competitor, UPS.FedEx boasts a vast logistics network of over 5,000 operating facilities and has a presence at more than 650 airports across the world. In addition, 80% of people in the US are within 5 miles of a FedEx location. There are no companies that are even close to the size and the scale of the logistics duopoly. When we consider that the logistics business is a very capital intensive business, this makes it highly likely that FedEx will at least retain its position as the second largest logistics company in the world.Image Source: FedEx 2019 Roadshow Investor PresentationThe company operates in the following four operating segments:FedEx Express: Per page 3 of FedEx's most recent 10-K, this segment is the world's largest express transportation company, offering time-definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories around the world. The segment accounted for about 55% of the company's revenue in FY 2018.FedEx Ground: This segment is a leading provider of small-package ground delivery services. The segment provides low-cost, day certain delivery to any business address in the US and Canada, in addition to delivery to 100% of US residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. The segment accounted for 28% of revenue in FY 2018.FedEx Freight: This segment is a leading US provider of less than truckload or LTL freight services across all lengths of haul. The segment accounted for 10% of the company's revenue in FY 2018.FedEx Services: The fourth and final segment provides sales, marketing, technical support, and customer service that support the company's transportation segments. This segment accounted for about 3% of revenues in FY 2018.Now that we have a better understanding of the company's operating segments, we can now transition to the reason for optimism toward FedEx's long-term growth prospects.As most are aware, microtransactions between individuals and businesses continues to grow year after year, forming a secular trend.It is for this reason that FedEx estimates the continued growth in e-commerce will translate into a growth in US shipment volumes from the current 50 million a day to 100 million a day by 2026.Image Source: FedEx 2019 Roadshow Investor PresentationWhen we consider the majority of FedEx's revenue is generated in the United States, this represents a massive domestic opportunity, not even factoring in that international demand will continue to grow as more people join the middle-class and disposable income increases.As the company indicates, it has already built out its network and capacity to serve thousands of retailers in the e-commerce space.As the presence of e-commerce continues to expand, FedEx will continue to build out its network and capacity in order to meet growing demand. The company plans to spend $5.6 billion in FY 2019 to continue building out its network and capacity.Image Source: FedEx 2019 Roadshow Investor PresentationAs a testament to the company's commitment to improving its ability to serve the needs of a variety of retailers, including e-tailers, the company has announced a long-term alliance agreement with Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), an alliance with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that will open 500 FedEx Office locations in Walmart stores by May 2020, and extra hours.Image Source: FedEx 2019 Roadshow Investor PresentationBecause the competition for the growing domestic shipping market will largely be fought out by FedEx and UPS, it's encouraging to know that FedEx holds a considerable advantage over UPS in its second largest segment, FedEx Ground.Not only do FedEx's customers want packages delivered economically, but they want them delivered as fast as possible. FedEx is in a position to compete fiercely against UPS, which should give them a distinct advantage in this business segment.Adding to the case for FedEx is the fact that the management team which will be leading FedEx into the future is highly experienced and have proven themselves to be effective.FedEx's future growth efforts are led by the founder and CEO of FedEx, Frederick Smith. Smith possesses nearly 50 years of logistics experience, having founded FedEx in 1971. He has taken FedEx from a startup to the second largest logistics company in the world, so I believe it's reasonable to trust his judgment more often than not. In addition, the COO Rajesh Subramaniam has been with FedEx since he joined the company's marketing team in Memphis in 1991.Another key management position is the CFO position, which is filled by Alan Graf Jr. Mr. Graf has been with the company since 1980, when he joined the company as a senior financial analyst. The executives occupying three of the most important executive positions collectively possess an average of 38 years company experience, which certainly deserves the benefit of the doubt when we consider what the company has grown into during the tenure of these executives.While FedEx's balance sheet has deteriorated in recent years as a result of aggressive expansion plans and share buybacks, the company still maintains an investment grade BBB credit rating from S&P, with a net interest coverage ratio a bit above 8.When we consider the massive growth potential of shipment volume in the years ahead, the company's experienced management team, and a reasonably strong balance sheet, the case for an investment in FedEx becomes apparent.While FedEx is a wonderful company, that doesn't mean it isn't subject to its own set of risks.The first risk facing FedEx is that due to the logistics industry being especially vulnerable to macroeconomic risks, FedEx would see a material and detrimental impact on its results in the event that the global economy enters a recession. Because the manufacture and sale of goods is largely dependent upon consumer spending and consumer confidence, it is worth mentioning that a downturn in the global economy would result in less shipments. As the company continues to expand its distribution centers in efforts to further reduce shipment times, this exposes the company to a higher fixed-cost structure, which can be difficult to quickly adjust to in the midst of shifting shipment volumes (page 84 of FedEx's most recent 10-K).Additionally, as a company that is dependent on international trade policies, it is worth noting that any acceleration in trade conflicts between countries across the globe where FedEx has operations could lead to increased costs for goods transported globally, causing a decline in customer demand for these products, and reduced shipment volume for FedEx (page 85 of FedEx's most recent 10-K). The recent debacle by FedEx in which the company misrouted parcels to the United States with Huawei addresses in Asia has placed the company in the cross-hairs of China. While the company claims that this was inadvertent, China remains unconvinced and has opened a probe into FedEx because China claims FedEx violated Chinese laws and regulations.Another risk is that as a global logistics company, FedEx is impacted by the price and availability of fuel. If the company is unable to mitigate the risks of higher fuel costs, the company's operating results could be materially impacted in a detrimental manner. Furthermore, any disruptions in the supply of fuel could interfere with FedEx's operations, leading to an inability to deliver packages in a timely manner, which could be detrimental to the company's reputation (page 87 of FedEx's most recent 10-K).Yet another risk to FedEx is that any disruptions or modifications in service by the USPS could have an adverse effect on FedEx's operations and financial results. The USPS is the largest customer of FedEx, and while the company has an agreement with USPS through 2024, any modifications to the agreement because of financial difficulties to USPS could result in unfavorable outcomes to FedEx (page 89 of FedEx's most recent 10-K).From a regulatory standpoint, FedEx could be materially impacted by any major regulations aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in response to the growing environmental concerns of the implications of greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulations imposed on GHG emissions could lead to increased compliance costs for FedEx to reduce GHG emissions and increased fuel costs. However, as the company states, it's difficult to know the extent of this threat to FedEx until more becomes known about the scope and extent of possible regulations (page 90 of FedEx's most recent 10-K).Another risk to FedEx is that with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) entering the logistics industry, there is the possibility that Amazon could eventually prove to be increased competition to FedEx. While FedEx holds a tremendous competitive advantage over Amazon in that it has a massive advantage in both industry experience and distribution network scale, there is always the possibility that Amazon could steal market share from FedEx (page 12 of FedEx's most recent 10-K). Fortunately, Amazon only represented 1.3% of FedEx's revenue in FY 2018, so the recent severance of ties with Amazon isn't detrimental from a financial results standpoint.The final risk to FedEx is that as a global company, FedEx generated about 33.4% of its revenue internationally, which exposes the company to foreign currency exchange risk (page 129 of FedEx's most recent 10-K). While these types of risks tend to even out over the long term, it is important to consider that because the company operates in more than 220 countries and territories, the risk of economic downturns, political instability, and military conflicts varies significantly from one country FedEx serves to the next. These factors must be constantly monitored by FedEx, and add a level of complication to the business.While these are far from the only risks facing an investment in FedEx, I believe these are the most material risks. For a more comprehensive listing of the risks facing FedEx, I would refer interested readers to pages 84-91 of the company's most recent 10-K.Adding to the case for an investment in FedEx is the fact that the company is also trading at a discount to fair value. In order to assess the extent to which FedEx is undervalued, I'll be using a variety of methods to arrive at a fair value estimate.The first valuation metric I'll use is the 5-year average forward PE ratio. FedEx shares are currently trading at a forward PE ratio of 10.5, which is well below the company's 5-year average of 14.5, per Simply Safe DividendsAssuming a reversion to a forward PE ratio of 13 (which would be a fair value of $204.53 a share), FedEx shares are trading at a 19.2% discount to fair value and offer 23.8% upside from the current price of $165.20 a share (as of June 22, 2019).The second valuation metric I'll use is the 5-year average dividend yield. While I typically use the 13-year median yield to gauge a company's fair value, the fact that the company's payout ratio has expanded a decent bit in the past decade skews the metric. An increase in the payout ratio from about 8% in 2012 to 15%+ in recent years makes the company's median 13-year yield much lower than what it would otherwise be, which inflates the company's fair value to an unreasonably lofty value.FedEx's current yield of 1.57% is well above its 5-year average of 0.83%, which suggests the company is undervalued if an investor believes the company's fundamentals remain fairly intact.Assuming a reversion to a fair value yield of 1.4% (which equates to a fair value of $185.71 a share), FedEx is trading at an 11.0% discount to fair value and offers 12.4% upside.Image Source: InvestopediaThe final valuation method I'll use is the dividend discount model or DDM.The first variable of the DDM formula is the expected dividend per share, which is simply the annualized dividend per share. In the case of FedEx, the current dividend is $2.60.The next variable of the DDM formula is the cost of capital equity, which is another term for an investor's required rate of return. Although the required rate of return can vary significantly from one investor to the next, I use a 10% rate of return as that has historically outperformed the broader market.The final variable of the formula is also the most difficult to assign a value to because it involves numerous considerations, such as the company's payout ratio (and whether there is room to expand the payout ratio), the company's future earnings growth rate, the strength of the balance sheet, and industry fundamentals.Given that FedEx's payout ratio is below 20% and that there is a fairly long runway for growth, I believe assigning a long-term dividend growth rate of 8.5% is a reasonable estimate. There's certainly room for the payout ratio to expand in the years ahead and FedEx's earnings growth potential over the long-term is at a minimum in the mid-single digits, if not high-single digits.When I factor in these variables to the formula, I arrive at a fair value of $173.33 a share. This would imply that shares of FedEx are trading at a 4.7% discount to fair value and offer 4.9% upside.When we average the three fair values together, we arrive at a fair value of $187.86 a share. This means shares of FedEx are trading at a discount to fair value of 12.1% and offer 13.7% upside.While the three fair values vary quite a bit, it's apparent that FedEx is at a minimum trading at a slight discount to its fair value, and likely at a moderate discount to fair value.Despite the recent dividend freeze, I believe the cautious approach from FedEx was the right move. While it's disappointing to current shareholders, the freeze from FedEx is an exception to the rule that companies who freeze their dividends usually end up cutting them in the near future. This company has plenty of future growth potential and operates a strong business.Despite the risks, FedEx is well positioned from a fundamental standpoint to combat these risks through its experienced management team and reasonably strong balance sheet.Adding to the case for an investment in FedEx is the notion that the company is at least trading at a small discount to fair value, and possibly a double-digit discount to fair value in a more likely scenario.Between the 1.6% dividend yield, conservative annual earnings growth of 8-9%, and 1.3% valuation multiple expansion, FedEx appears likely to deliver 10.9-11.9% annual total returns over the next decade."

These events appear to be part on the ongoing escalation in global trade tensions, particularly between America and China, which could put FedEx's current dividend policy at risk. FedEx shares yield 1.6% as of this writing.Reportedly, in FedEx's bid to comply with the Trump administration's crackdown on Huawei (the Chinese telecommunications and mobile handset giant that Western governments believe is way too close with China's central government), the firm sent two packages meant for Huawei's offices in China to one of FedEx's global hubs in Memphis, TN. Where the Chinese investigation might end up is unknown, but that's likely going to be dependent on how US-China trade talks progress over the coming months with both sides looking to gain leverage over the other.With relatively weak dividend coverage, a product of its sizable net debt load and capital-intensive business, rising macro headwinds will be hard to circumvent if things don't change. The company cut its earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 due to trade war complications. Here is a choice excerpt from FedEx's FY2018 10-K report, and the only time 'China' is mentioned in the filing;As a company that lives and dies by the volume of goods being transported all over the world, a decline in world trade and a retreat from globalization poses a major risk to FedEx's financials. Not so much as to represent an existential risk, but as trade tensions continue to escalate, that will weigh heavily against expectations of FedEx's future performance and likely its stock price as well. Keep in mind its FY2018 annual report covers the fiscal year that ended May 31, 2018, indicating management should have a lot to say in FedEx's upcoming 10-K filing for FY2019 regarding the firm's trade war risks.In FY2017, FedEx generated $4.9 billion in net operating cash flow on a consolidated basis while spending $5.1 billion on capital expenditures, resulting in negative free cash flow generation. A similar story played out in FY2018, when FedEx generated $4.7 billion in net operating cash flow, which was outstripped by $5.7 billion in capital expenditures. The firm spent $0.5 billion on dividend payments in FY2018, on top of $1.0 billion in share repurchases, all of which was funded by its balance sheet.At the end of FedEx's third quarter FY2019 (which ended February 28, 2019), it was sitting on $2.9 billion in cash & cash equivalents versus $18.4 billion in total debt, resulting in a net debt position of $15.5 billion. The company's Dividend Cushion ratio is a mere 0.4 (anything below 1 should signal caution). While FedEx shares are currently trading well below the low end of our fair value range (derived from our rigorous discounted cash flow analysis), keep in mind that's likely due to major exogenous threats to its business model.We don't think share repurchases are the call right, and instead FedEx should direct cash towards deleveraging and maintaining its dividend. The firm still has investment grade credit ratings for its unsecured debt (BBB/Baa2) with stable outlooks, which indicates that it retains access to debt markets at competitive rates for now. Here are our thoughts on FedEx from our 16-page Stock Report;As FedEx is a company that already had a high degree of operating leverage, on top of a large net debt load (creating hefty interest expenses), downward pressure on its shipped volumes pose a major downside risk that needs to be monitored. Synergies realized through its TNT Express acquisition over the coming quarters will help offset some of those concerns.We are actively monitoring the ongoing trade turmoil and any effects it might have on both our discounted cash flow models and capital markets at-large. The FedEx story will likely be one of many as China searches for less conventional ways to punish American companies in retaliation for the tariffs the Trump administration has levied against its exports. A dividend cut isn't necessarily imminent, but it's important to note that FedEx's current dividend policy is backed by weak fundamentals (limited free cash flow generation, large net debt load, worsening macro outlook, downward guidance revisions) and faces major exogenous threats."
4270928,63883,2019-06-18T19:29:34-04:00,"FedEx was widely expected to raise its payout in June, after four steady quarterly payments. However, FedEx kept the dividend steady.No increase came as a disappointment to dividend growth investors, but trade uncertainty explains management's cautious view.A low valuation and strong growth tailwinds fuel our continued buy recommendation.","By Josh ArnoldIn the world of investing, stocks that increase their dividends regularly are sought out by those that seek to build long-term wealth. Rising payouts afford investors not only rising income amounts but the ability to compound their wealth over time by reinvesting the proceeds.FedEx Corporation (FDX) is among the Dividend Achievers, a group of 264 stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 10 years consecutively. You can see all 264 Dividend Achievers here.These stocks have demonstrated long-term stability in earnings, as well as the willingness and ability to return ever-larger amounts of capital to shareholders, making them attractive to dividend investors.FedEx's dividend growth accelerated in the years coming out of the Great Recession. From fiscal 2014 to 2018, FedEx increased its dividend at annual compound growth rate of 27%. Such a high dividend growth rate made FedEx among the best dividend growth stocks in the S&P 500 Index.But FedEx held its most recent quarterly dividend payout steady, when the company had been widely expected to raise its dividend. Despite the dividend disappointment, we maintain a buy rating on FedEx, thanks to its strong business model, long-term growth potential, and low valuation.FedEx is one of the world’s largest delivery companies, providing services to nearly every country around the globe. Indeed, FedEx delivers to more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product, giving it access to commerce on a scale that is difficult to match.Source: Investor presentation, slide 3FedEx delivers to every address in the US, in addition to serving more than 220 countries worldwide. It also has nearly 700 aircraft to move Express packages quickly and efficiently around the globe. Its truck fleet rivals any other in the world, and its 450,000 employees deliver more than 15 million shipments every day.The company’s portfolio contains 13 Air Express Hubs and 2,150 Stations, 39 FedEx Ground Hubs and 600+ operating facilities, 370 FedEx Freight service centers, and nearly 2,000 FedEx Office locations. FedEx has built a diversified portfolio of products that gives it a wide and deep reach when it comes to global commerce.FedEx should produce about $70 billion in revenue this year, and it currently trades for a $42 billion market capitalization.Source: Investor presentation, slide 4The company’s portfolio is diverse, but it still derives well over half of its total revenue from its air business. The Ground business produces just over a quarter of revenue, while Freight and Services make up the balance. FedEx has always positioned itself as Express-heavy with less reliance on Ground, which sets it apart from its rivals. The strategy has worked over time as FedEx continues to grow nicely over long periods.FedEx reported third quarter earnings on 3/19/19, and results were somewhat weak, sending the stock lower. Revenue was up 3% to $17 billion during the quarter, and operating income rose on an adjusted basis by the same amount; operating margin was flat on an adjusted basis year over year at 5.8% of revenue.Operating income saw improvements due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses, US volume growth, a favorable net impact of fuel in all of the company’s segments, as well as increased yields at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.Partially offsetting these benefits were higher costs at FedEx Ground, which were driven by increased purchased transportation rates, as well as year-round six-day-per-week operations to support higher package volumes. FedEx Express international revenues declined as well as a result of lower yields and unfavorable exchange rates. FedEx Express yields were down in the US and internationally primarily due to higher growth in lower-yielding services, as well as lower weight per shipment. In other words, the company’s mix shifted unfavorably during the quarter.Net income was much lower in Q3 this year as compared to last year, but the difference is not operational. Rather, FedEx enjoyed a much lower tax rate during last year’s Q3 and thus, its earnings per share fell from $3.72 to $3.03 on an adjusted basis, despite higher revenue and roughly congruent operating margins. This decline of 18.5%, therefore, shouldn’t necessarily be a worry to investors because the gain last year was due to a one-time implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and won’t be repeated.Management did comment on slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends, which spooked investors into thinking the company’s volumes, and potentially pricing, may be at risk. As a result, FedEx launched a voluntary employee buyout program, is restricting hiring, limiting discretionary spending company-wide, and reviewing additional spending to mitigate the somewhat weaker outlook for revenue.For the full-year, FedEx is now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $15.10 to $15.90 before the impact of a mark-to-market adjustment on the company’s retirement plan, and excluding integration expenses for the company’s years-old acquisition of TNT Express. There are also excluded costs from legal matters, restructuring, and deferred tax liabilities. Including all of these items, earnings per share will be somewhere around $12 or $13, not $15 to $16. Taking all of this into account, we’re choosing to value FedEx based upon its operational earnings, and expect to see $15.50 in earnings per share for this year.FedEx sees moderate US domestic economic growth and no further weakening in international conditions. It expects to see $450 million to $575 million in costs from the employee buyout scheme, which should predominantly occur in the fiscal fourth quarter. As a result, next quarter’s results will likely be pretty messy. Savings from the program should be $225 million to $275 million in fiscal 2020, however, so the program should pay for itself in about two years, with significant savings to follow.FedEx continues to make progress on its TNT Express integration, which has been a sore spot for investors for three years. The companies have integrated their intra-European shipments into the TNT Express European road network. This development means FedEx Express customers in Europe should see at least one business day of improvement, on average, in transit time in many of the company’s busiest lanes. This is a major service improvement that was years in the making.FedEx did note that operating in Europe requires lengthy consultations and approvals, which is why its TNT integration is moving at a glacial pace. As a result, it said integration activities will continue into fiscal 2021.FedEx has produced some fairly ambitious long-term growth goals in recent years as the company believes it is on a path to sustainable profitability growth. In addition, FedEx continues to benefit from a growing global economy, given its wide exposure to more than 220 countries.Source: Investor presentation, slide 6FedEx thinks it can boost earnings per share by 10% to 15% annually by boosting profitable revenue – not just chasing revenue for the sake of higher revenue – which should drive 10%+ operating margins. We’re slightly less bullish than that as we are forecasting about 8% earnings per share growth annually in the coming five years, as we find 10% to 15% to be a bit much.Still, 8% growth is robust, and we think that FedEx will get there from a combination of growth sources. Revenue should continue to grow in the low to mid-single digit range for the foreseeable future, given that economic growth, on average, around the globe has been decent. In addition, the continued adoption by consumers of shipping products to their houses instead of shopping in physical stores is helping as well with volumes. Pricing has been somewhat weaker of late, but we still think a steady revenue tailwind will help FedEx boost earnings over time.In addition, FedEx’s stated operating margin goal of 10% is nearly double its Q1 performance of 5.8% on an adjusted basis. The company is still grappling with significant costs related to the TNT acquisition, which is crimping margins. In addition, as it continues to grow revenue, it should be able to leverage down some of its support costs. Indeed, the layoffs announced recently should help with that as well. We think it may take some time to get to 10% operating margins, but FedEx has a fairly long runway, and it is taking the steps necessary to execute.FedEx also sporadically buys back its own shares, so we see perhaps a low single-digit tailwind from that, particularly since the valuation is currently so low; FedEx may opportunistically buy back some stock at a much lower valuation than what it is accustomed to.All of that said, there are some risks to the company’s growth. Parts of the world are seeing signs of economic slowdown, although the US and Europe appear to still be in fairly good shape. In addition, tariffs and trade wars aren’t good for anyone, as global commerce suffers and, along with it, FedEx.Still, we like the company’s growth prospects, given its leverage to a wide and deep cross-section of the global economy, as well as its scale and ability to boost margins over time.The valuation is where it gets quite interesting for FedEx. The stock is as cheap as it has been at any point in the past decade. Shares trade for just 10.3 times the midpoint of the company’s revised earnings per share guidance at $15.50. The 10-year average valuation for FedEx is 16.5 times earnings, but we assess fair value at 13 times earnings today, given the concerns raised above. Still, that implies a meaningful ~5% tailwind to annual total returns should the valuation revert back to just 13 times earnings. Long-term holders of the stock could see the valuation eventually reflate back into the mid-teens or better, but we see that as unrealistic in the near term.The dividend announcement was certainly a negative surprise as consensus estimates were for FedEx to offer up a payout of 80 cents for the next distribution; investors instead received the same 65-cent payout from prior quarters. FedEx didn’t provide any specific reasons the payout wasn’t raised, but certainly, it isn’t because the company’s dividend is in danger. The current payout ratio is under 17% based upon the midpoint of revised guidance and the 65-cent quarterly payout. FedEx, it would seem, has other uses in mind for that cash.We are disappointed that FedEx chose not to boost the payout, given its history with dividend growth has been outstanding in recent years. There is still a lot of time to boost the payout for this year, but at a time when investors are selling the stock, this isn’t helping. We still think there is a lot of dividend growth left for FedEx in the coming years, but we're dissatisfied to see a flat payout for July.Still, with the projected 8% earnings growth, 5% annual tailwind to total returns from the valuation moving higher, and the 1.6% dividend yield, we see in excess of 14% annual returns for the next five years for FedEx. That puts the stock near the top in terms of large capitalization companies in our coverage universe for projected total returns.While we certainly would have preferred to see FedEx boost its dividend for July, we think there is still more than enough to like. The stock is trading at what can only be described as a trough valuation, while growth appears to be intact. There are risks to FedEx’s outlook and indeed, its earnings guidance has already been cut once. However, particularly for investors with a long holding period, we think FedEx offers compelling value, and we rate the stock a buy."
4270738,44781,2019-06-18T02:08:31-04:00,"FDX did not increase its dividend on schedule.The trade war is really hurting this company's growth outlook.Yet, shares are down ~40% while EPS guidance is down only 10%.To me, shares look grossly undervalued.","I have to admit, 2019 has been a somewhat disappointing year for me in terms of dividend growth.Earlier in the year, Constellation Brands (STZ) gave investors a paltry 1.4% increase. Prior to that news, I considered STZ to be one of the more promising DGI companies in the market. Sure, its top-line growth had slowed some in recent years and yes, the company had spent billions for cannabis exposure in recent quarters, but I still thought its management team would reward investors alongside of the M&A action. In response to this disappointing increase, I’ve sold ~2/3 of my STZ position. I want to maintain some exposure because of STZ’s unique growth prospects due to its large cannabis exposure. Yet, I consider the stock more of a growth bet than a DGI play at this point in time and with that in mind, I didn’t want to maintain a full position.Then, Apple (AAPL) gave its smallest increase since initiating its dividend back in 2012, at just 5.5%. Granted, AAPL is also returning $100b+ to shareholders in the form of a buyback, so I guess I shouldn’t complain much about shareholder returns there. AAPL is my largest holding and I believed that the company would give high single digit/low double-digit dividend growth for the foreseeable future. Once again I was wrong, but then again, the massive buyback does at least set this company up for long-term success in terms of future dividend growth. I haven’t sold an AAPL share in response and I don’t plan to. I continue to believe that this is one of the most attractive long-term DGI plays in the market, yet I will be paying close attention to future increases, hoping to see them rise back up towards the 10% range.And most recently, we come to FedEx (FDX). This is a company that I bought because of its illustrious dividend growth history. In 2015, 2016, 2017, and in 2018, FedEx gave its shareholders absolutely wonderful dividend increases (the annual growth totals were 25%, 60%, 25%, and 30%, respectively). I didn’t expect to see such higher dividend growth in 2019 because of the trade war headwinds that FedEx is facing, but then again, I was certainly surprised by Monday’s news. FDX declared its July dividend after the bell and instead of giving investors an increase like it usually does during this announcement cycle, it simply maintained the dividend at $0.65/share. So, after this apparent freeze, what do dividend growth investors do with FedEx now?I have a fairly steadfast rule in my portfolio which states: a dividend cut will result in an equity sale. However, a freeze is much different than a cut. Being so concerned about a dividend being maintained rather than increased by 10% or so is a fairly good problem to have in the grand scheme of things. I suppose this is the nature of a dividend growth strategy… when the assets you own are of such high quality, the problems that they present will oftentimes appear to be rather small. But, when my main priority is generating a reliably increasing passive income stream and a company freezes its dividend, it is no longer meeting expectations (in the short term, at least).I suppose it’s worth mentioning that FDX could increase its dividend in the coming quarters and still maintain its annual increase streak. This is certainly a possibility. Maybe management is just waiting to get more clarity on the trade front. How long they’ll wait is your best guess. From June of 2008 to March of 2009, FDX maintained its dividend at $0.11/share for 8 quarters in a row. So, this company has a fairly recent history of being conservative with its cash flows/balance sheet when it comes to dividend growth. I think the broader economy is much stronger now than it was back then, but who knows… maybe FDX is trying to send a signal here. This management team has its thumb on the strength of the global economy more so than most. Time will tell, yet the fact remains: a freeze is much better than a cut.Cuts can be pretty devastating to income streams, but freezes don’t have to be. Just think about what we’ve discussed already: FDX was paying $0.11/share in 2009 and today, in 2019, I’m upset about the dividend being frozen at $0.65/share. In other words, over the last decade, FDX management has increased the shareholder dividend by ~500%. Heck, if the dividend grew by half that much, a third, or really, even a fourth of that over the next decade, I’d be pleased. Obviously I’m not a soothsayer and I’m not sure if anyone, including FDX management has an idea of what the dividend will look like in 2029, but I continue to believe that it will be significantly higher than it is today, which is why I’m not selling my shares even though Monday’s news was negative.Another reason that I’m not selling my shares is because I’m underwater on them. I began buying FDX in March of 2017 at $190. I’ve added to that position several times since, buying shares with prices as high as $209 and as low as $187. When I was buying these shares, I thought that FDX’s valuation was attractive. The company was usually trading somewhere in the 13x range and frankly put, I never would have expected to see the stock’s P/E fall down to the 10x range where it sits today. While I’m not happy about FDX’s frozen dividend, I’m also not so bearish on the stock long term that I’d be willing to lock in losses to reduce exposure. On the contrary, I remain bullish long term, which is all the more reason for me to hold on to these shares which appear to be grossly undervalued.When I began buying FDX shares I had no idea that the trade war would play out like it has. A slowing global economy has had a major impact on FDX’s bottom line. It wasn’t all that long ago that FDX management was guiding for diluted EPS of more than $17/share for 2019. Yet, during recent quarters guidance has fallen and now sits roughly 10% below the prior high guidance (management’s most recent 2019 diluted $15.10-$15.90). But, what’s curious to me is that the stock has fallen much, much more than 10% since June of 2018 when the initial 2019 guidance was given.In June of 2018, FDX shares were trading for more than $260/share. Today, they’re trading for $160. So, while the EPS guidance has fallen by 10% or so, the share price has experienced a precipitous ~40% drop. The divergence between share price movement and the fundamental outlook here just doesn’t add up. Sure, FDX should have fallen on the negative guidance updates. I think it’s fair to argue that the stock was overvalued when it was trading for ~18x earnings a year ago. But, pricing a company with flat EPS growth prospects in 2019 and double-digit growth outlooks in 2020 and 2021 for 10x is irrational, in my opinion.So, with this in mind, I’m actually considering buying shares of FDX, even though its dividend growth announcement was so disappointing. I know that probably seems fairly odd coming from someone who considers himself a DGI investor, yet at a certain point the value proposition and the possibility of long-term total returns that such deep value presents overwhelms my income-oriented focus. When I saw the flat dividend news, my first inclination was to start planning out how I was going to make sales. However, upon further reflection and a deeper dive into FDX’s business and long-term growth prospects, I regained my conviction in the name as a long-term hold. Frankly put, dividend news aside, FDX is one of the best values that I see in the entire market right now.Source: F.A.S.T. Graph I own a full FDX position, so I’m not exactly in a hurry to go overweight. But, FDX shares are currently trading for roughly 14% below my most recent purchase at $187 and I am always a big fan of using value that the market presents to lower my cost basis in the high-quality names that I hope to hold long term. I didn’t already own so many FDX shares, I’d be buying today, yet I will most likely wait for FDX’s next earnings release before making any trades.To me, gathering information before making a move makes the most sense because there is the threat of yet another guidance cut by management. Maybe the frozen dividend is signaling for further disappointment. Negative guidance would certainly hurt the stock price, though I will say that if the stock continues its sell-off and makes new 52-week lows in the $150 range, I will strongly consider adding to my position even if earnings have yet to roll around.This article was previously published for members of The Dividend Growth Club."
4269015,22201,2019-06-07T09:41:40-04:00,"FedEx stock is trading near 52-week lows on trade war concerns.These are overblown, and its exposure to China is modest.The dividend is not at risk.Near 10x earnings, FedEx is a strong value.","Last weekend, China announced that it is targeting FedEx (FDX). It appears that China is happy to play the tit for tat game as the trade wars escalate. The US started things off by going after both a key Huawei executive and its ability to operate internationally. Now, China is starting to target American companies seemingly in response.FedEx is one of the first to come under fire. Bloomberg said that China is building a blacklist of companies that it considers ""unreliable"" and FedEx is one of the first to be deemed as such. What was FedEx's reason for getting on to this list? China is reportedly investigating the company's ""wrongful delivery of packages"".At first glance, that probably sounds incredibly petty. However, Reuters reported that some Huawei packages in particular that were supposed to be shipped from Japan to China were instead sent to the U.S. This implies that FedEx may have taken actions contrary to China's wishes rather than simply making honest mistakes.In any case, FedEx has found itself as another target in the rapidly intensifying trade war. Before you panic and dump your FDX stock though, it's important to look at the bigger picture.First things first, is China a major concern for FedEx? Judging by their latest 10-K, it doesn't appear to be overwhelmingly important, though the company certainly has a presence there. It built a new International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai which opened in January 2018. Additionally, it built its Asia-Pacific hub in 2009 in Guangzhou.However, these facilities don't appear to be that central in the grand scheme of things. Its Guangzhou package sorting facility, for example, has sorting capacity of just 62,000 items per hour. That puts it below the capacity of its Paris international operation, in addition to domestic sorting facilities at Oakland, Newark, Fort Worth, Indianapolis, and Memphis. The Memphis operation alone has sorting capacity of 484,000 items per hour - nearly seven times the capacity of its Guangzhou site.I'd further note that the latest FedEx 10-K only mentions the word ""China"" four times and makes no detailed discussion of the country in its risk factors. This implies that the overall impact from being labeled an unreliable partner by the Chinese government is quite modest.Data by YChartsWhile FedEx stock has gotten annihilated over the past year, we have to ask how much of the current issues will really matter out beyond the next year or two.The fundamentals for the business remain great. Globally, there are only three major players in the space: FedEx, UPS, and DHL. In the domestic U.S. market, you only have two, as DHL was forced to abandon America after suffering massive losses. In a market where you have just two or three competitors, it tends to keep pricing stable and profit margins high. With e-commerce sales only going upward, there should be plenty of demand to drive more business to both UPS and FedEx. Yes, I understand that bears suggest that the mechanics of the e-commerce business will drive down margins and that's perhaps true. But when you have a duopoly, it should insulate the companies from too much structural pricing decay.And with the stock at just 10x earnings, even stable business results, let alone earnings growth, is plenty to make FDX stock a winner from this valuation.Of course, we must mention the elephant in the room. Like so many other battered stocks, FedEx has gotten hit in significant part by the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) concerns. Amazon is building its own delivery capabilities to handle much of its own traffic and potentially even compete with FedEx and UPS.There are also rumors swirling that Amazon may buy Boost Mobile as part of a forced divestiture from the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger. Amazon's real interest in the deal would likely be the wireless spectrum, not the company's current operations. And what would Amazon do with it? Potentially, they could use it for drone deliveries in the future, which could be a drag on FedEx's business. But is this realistic? Three decade veteran of the telecom business, Craig Moffett, told Bloomberg that it was not. He said:He further added that:I'll side with Moffett, at least for now. This seems like another example where the Amazon rumor mill runs way ahead of what's actually happening. Amazon may eventually become a serious competitor to FedEx, but I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon. Low margin businesses where they have to compete with a highly skilled and entrenched monopoly don't really do much for Amazon's profits or the narrative that drives its stock price higher.It's also worth noting SA author AllStarTrader's recent FedEx article. In it, AllStarTrader estimated that just 2-3% of FedEx's current business is delivering packages for Amazon. Furthermore, not even all of that business is at risk in the immediate term, as much of it is third-party fulfillment through Amazon that the e-commerce giant is unlikely to try to handle in-house anytime soon.I'll briefly mention another recent article here on Seeking Alpha which suggested that FedEx's dividend could be at risk from rising trade war tensions.The author makes a fair point in that the company has generated anemic free cash flow over the past couple of years. That's true. But it isn't the full picture. The company is still integrating its large TNT merger and has spent heavily on CapEx associated with that. Prior to 2017, the company was generating $3-4/share in FCF consistently, and free cash has rebounded in recent quarters after the heavy spending in 2018. The company's dividend is $2.60/share currently, so it could cover that out of its free cash flow from even pre-TNT days. And, presumably, the company should generate a lot more cash flow post-merger.The balance sheet is BBB rated, which isn't great, but it's in investment-grade territory. In recent years, FedEx has spent much more on its share buyback than it has on its dividend. If anything, I'd expect it to cut the buyback long before the dividend. Finally, with earnings of more than $15 per share, on a payout ratio basis, the dividend is a modest ~17% of earnings.This drop in FedEx stock is getting ridiculous. Shares are already back to where they were at the worst of the December correction. FDX stock has bounced a little this week but is still just four percent off its 52-week lows.Yet, the company is still set to earn more than $15/share this year, despite the global slowdown. Sure, earnings will be down by something like $1/share this year due to the global slowdown and trade war concerns. But the stock is down from $230 to $155 since November. Was that $1/share of earnings power really worth $75 per share in FedEx's stock price?FedEx stock got clocked during the Great Financial Crisis as well. But it bounced back in a hurry as people realized that a brief drop in earnings hadn't done anything to disrupt the business's long-term tremendous power and entrenched competitive position:Data by YChartsRegardless of how deeply FDX stock slumps during this downturn, I expect shares to turn sharply higher, surpassing $200 again as soon as sentiment picks up about global economic conditions."
4255878,105093,2019-04-23T08:24:41-04:00,"We'll take a look at logistics giant FedEx, a long-standing dividend-paying company who didn't even cut payout during the recession.Due to negativity, the stock has been trading below fair value for a long time - and it's not too late to buy.I walk you through why I believe this company to represent an appealing value opportunity.","The logistics sector is a jungle this day and age, with cut-throat margins and businesses appearing and disappearing in the advent of an ever-increasing digital revolution and e-commerce sector. In this article, I'll delve into FedEx (FDX), one of my picks in the logistics sector, and why I believe you should consider owning this stock, despite what some may call a poor dividend.Without further delay, let's get going!(Source: Studio Marque)Unlike competitor UPS (UPS), FedEx was founded as ""recently"" as back in the 1970s. The person who founded the company, Fred Smith, is still the CEO and chairman of the company. 50 years later, the company now has the largest airline in the world in terms of flown freight tons and is in the top 5 in terms of fleet size. FedEx has 450, 000 employees operating a logistics network spanning 220+ countries. The company is also known for developing a system that could track packages in real-time and provide geolocation services to find lost deliveries. These features are now bread and butter in almost every other carrier worldwide.This company is massive, and it operates across the entire globe.(Source: FedEx Investor Presentation)The company operates in several segments related to various types of freight/related services.(Source: FedEx Investor Relations)The ""other"" segment includes things such as FedEx Trade Network (since 2019 rebranded into FedEx Logistics). According to the company, this rebranding will clarify things to the customers.Remaining segments are self-explanatory, where the firm has bundled a series of sometimes interlacing solutions regarding the transporting of physical goods. Large portions of the company freight solutions/services include one or several of these segments.(Source: FedEx Investor Presentation)FedEx enjoys sizeable macroeconomic trend support. With increasing e-commerce, B2B e-commerce, and an ever-growing degree of global trade, the increase for FedEx services (barring failure to meet standards/expectations) are almost a given. This can also be seen in company revenues and sales. FedEx has nearly doubled its sales in less than 10 years, going from ~$35B to ~$70B in sales (Source: FedEx FY18 Presentation).Even a moderate degree of global economic growth will positively impact this company, and while the risk of a hard Brexit promises potential complication and some risk for this corporation, the overall picture in a growing, global world remains positive indeed - especially with a continuing, strong US economy (both for consumers and businesses). The fact is, 80% of the American population lives within a 5-mile radius of a FedEx hold location, and the company currently offers drop-off and retrieval at tens of thousands of locations in the US.(Source: FedEx Investor Presentation)Increased number of sales while at the same time increasing shipping rates also points to a company tendency where consumers accept that increased costs are passed onto them.Industry pressure is getting to this company, which is part of what has depressed the share price to valuations we see today. However, FedEx naturally has plans for developing each of its business segments to meet the ever-transforming needs of our world.In terms of FedEx Express, the company intends to modernize its air fleet (increasing CapEx) for greater reliability and fuel efficiency, as well as integrating existing company networks with one another. FedEx ground has gone to a 6-day per week/year round delivery, as well as benefitting from a yield growth from higher shipping rates on packages with larger dimensions. FedEx also touts being faster than main competitor UPS, with increasing market shares up to 30% for 2018.(Source: FedEx Investor Presentation)FedEx freight already has competitive advantages in the form of a nationwide LTL network offering that offers the fastest published times of any LTL within the US, as well as any service connecting the US to major Canadian markets. The changes announced in this segment are working on improving already-improving margins, as well as segment cross-selling and optimizing railroad freight.In many ways, FedEx boasts far healthier finances than its main competitor, UPS. The company has a payout ratio bordering on ridiculous in terms of how conservative it is.(Source: SimplySafeDividends)The earnings growth rate has been nothing short of spectacular over time, increasing ~336% in less than 10 years, with annual sales growth of between 3-20% annually since 2011. At the same time, the company has increased its annual dividend by 400%. Were they to do this again, your YoC in 10 years on this stock would be 5.4% at today's share price - which is greater growth than competitor UPS has offered the past years.(Source: SimplySafeDividends)The company also boasts very competitive RoIC/RoE relationships, easily surpassing even Warren Buffett's measurement indicating an economic moat of some kind for the company.The company is BBB-rated, with a 44% debt/cap ratio and a 3.45X Net Debt/EBITDA ratio, representing perhaps the only red flag when looking at fundamental finances for FedEx. The company's interest coverage remains a solid 9.35X in terms of operating income, however, giving the company plenty of safety not only to meet debt obligations but to continue distributing its conservative 16%-payout ratio dividend. The current company debt is in part due to its acquiring of TNT Express, which forced the company to leverage its sheet somewhat.However, all things considered, considering the kind of capital-intensive business FedEx runs, it may be considered a competitive advantage to maintain a negative dividend payout ratio in terms of leveraged free cash flow in the face of the coming business changes. It's also not as though the company, in terms of earnings, is incapable of paying down this debt - they are.This is part of what differs the company from its competitor UPS. While UPS management has decided to take a different turn - namely trying to minimize CapEx - FedEx has instead consistently spent its money on growth initiatives, which have resulted in impressive numbers in terms of revenue growth for this company - where FedEx has grown far faster than UPS over the past decade or so. While it's grown, FedEx has also been able to invest in the aforementioned growth initiatives thanks to its conservative and future-oriented policy and management plans.One must ask itself - when the world is going through one of the most expansionary periods in commerce/consumer growth through the introduction and normalization of E-commerce - should a company focus on enriching shareholders through share buybacks and dividend increases, or should it focus on capitalizing on its economies of scale to invest in the future, thereby securing not only its current but its future position.Now, obviously, my view is that FedEx has placed itself in a clearly dominant position for future growth as opposed to UPS, who will not only have to invest in the same growth initiatives and solutions (such as automation and AI) to keep competitive but doing so while maintaining 50%+ payout ratio. (Source: SimplySafeDividends)A stock such as FedEx faces a number of industry and company-specific challenges that warrant consideration prior to investment.Firstly, there's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) increasing its own logistical capabilities. The company is set on becoming a major player in this market, and both the market as well as investors see some risk for the company here. There have also been a number of stock downgradings for FedEx as a direct result of a stronger Amazon entry on the market. A combination of these in conjunction with recent earnings reports, combined with a general market dip was what drove the stock low during late 2018/early 2019.People have also had mixed feelings on the acquisition of TNT, despite FedEx essentially paying a fairly good price for the company (as opposed to the price UPS was slated to pay prior to EU regulators torpedoing the deal). Arguments have been the lack of similarities between the company, the amount spent on pensions, which has decreased FedEx operating cash flows to an actual negative amount for 2018. The integration of TNT seems to be more complicated than even FedEx wants to admit.(Source: Freightwaves)It's likely that we haven't seen the last of integration challenges in terms of this acquisition/deal.On paper and when looking at the surface, there are many that argue that UPS is the superior investment to FedEx. Even Buffett himself owns a great deal of UPS. FedEx boasts smaller margins and a smaller yield in terms of dividend. UPS even tends to trade at a premium valuation, looking in historical terms. This margin compression for FedEx is, in part, a result of the acquisition of TNT which has made UPS the company with far better margins as a result of shipping rate increases while controlling their CapEx spending far more than FedEx, which instead has been spending far greater amounts of money on projects and improvements.To some investors, it's hard to justify an investment in a company yielding a sub-2% dividend in terms of today's share price.Like any company operating on a global scale such as FedEx, the company faces a large number of political and sociological risks. While hard to grasp and while everyone requires logistics regardless of political state/stability, there's something to be said for risks such as Brexit, wars in parts of the world and other political uncertainties. This risk is not FedEx-specific, but I believe it warrants mentioning due to the company operating in no less than 220 countries.Moving onto company valuation, we're seeing a rather positive picture.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)My own FedEx shares were bought close to the period of excessive undervaluation a few months back. While this period was incredibly profitable even compared to today's share price, there's still an opportunity to be had here, given a valuation of a blended P/E of 12.8.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)This opportunity comes in the shape of 16-20% annual returns in case FedEx maintains expected valuation until 2022. Given the company's investments and growth initiatives, I don't believe this expectation to be out of character in any way.Analyst accuracy is... acceptable, with a 1Y/2Y 30% failure ratio, though none of the previous failures since 2010 are more than 20% off the mark (one 20%, rest 3-11% off). Of course, the company and earnings history isn't everything. Let's try and provide a bit of security here going forward.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)Even assuming only an 8% annual increase in earnings (last year's increase alone was ~24.5%), you'd still be making ~13.5-16% annual rates of return until 2024. Assuming more historically accurate growth rates, we're looking at as much as 18-21% annual rates of return, which in themselves are some market-beating percentages.In short, today's valuation looking simply at the numbers, are very favorable and speak for investing in this company.When looking at FedEx, one of the primary things most investors need to overcome is the fact that the company yields a bare 1.3-1.5% at the current stock price. This is a DGI stock, and the company has everything it needs to keep growing the low-payout dividend further going forward.For me as an investor, (because I'm Swedish/German and live in Scandinavia) as I lack access to T-bills and similar type of investments, this is far easier to justify - and that is the reason why a current 0.4% of my portfolio is allocated to FDX, with an additional 0.6% possible if I find appealing further entry points down the road. It's one of those stocks I've come back to again and again and bought in small batches. A position to grow indefinitely over time because I believe that the company will outlive me by far.I understand why people believe UPS warrants a premium valuation. In fact, there's an argument to be made that UPS currently is barely fairly valued.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)On paper, there's no doubt that UPS currently looks like the better stock for a DGI investor. However, FedEx has been investing in growth initiatives for years, instead of purely raising the dividend or buying back stock. Their payout ratio is below 25%. UPS has been cutting costs and CapEx for the past decade, instead offering share buybacks and dividend growth. FedEx also bought TNT, which is biting heavily into company cash flow at this time. However - remember that FDX bought TNT at a discount compared to the price that UPS was prepared to pay for the European logistics giant. FedEx paid $2B less than UPS's original offer.Long term, there's very little doubt in my mind which of these two companies will triumph in the logistics space - it's FedEx.Do I believe UPS will crash and burn? No, Of course not. UPS is undoubtedly a great company. However, the company has its work cut out for them doing the things that FedEx has already done for the past decade and more.In addition, it's likely that UPS has a far higher exposure to Amazon than FedEx.(Source: Forbes)This means that should Amazon enter this space more seriously, UPS is going to be far more affected than FedEx - advantage, once again, FedEx. FedEx is simply more of a global company than UPS is likely to ever be, going forward the next few years.Buying this company, one needs to understand that current management is focused on investing for the future - and that trend is extremely likely to continue, looking at the company communications. That means the main way of capital/investment appreciation is an increase in share price, coupled with long-term dividend growth. It probably won't buy back shares or perform aggressive dividend hikes as long as current management/the CEO is in charge - and to me, the man looks to be immortal.As long as you go into this stock with your expectations clearly managed, I believe you'll be a happy long-term holder of the Federal Express Corporation, now known as FedEx.Thank you kindly for reading.I believe FedEx at these levels of ~$190/share to be worth purchasing. A valuation of P/E ~12 is something I consider appealing, and I recommend you purchase more should it fall to P/E ~11.5 or below. Please observe that the stock price recommendation was calculated at the time of the article.I will update this article, or publish an updated thesis should things change, or/and in conjunction with future earnings updates."
4290847,105014,2019-09-10T21:41:49-04:00,Recent events do not bolster investor confidence.Operating results have declined for three years.Fedex’s operating margin is structurally lower than that of UPS.FCF has been dwindling.Shares are undervalued by as much as 47% when compared to those of UPS.,"FedEx (FDX) has issues integrating and improving the results of TNT after the acquisition three years ago. It is facing external risks, which include slowing economic conditions around the world and the ongoing trade war. Yet, when compared to United Parcel Service (UPS), it is greatly undervalued, by as much as 47%. My estimation of its value indicates that the market is placing very little value on the company's Express segment, yet it delivers about 50% of FDX’s revenue. Patience will be needed to wait for the closing of the valuation gap, as results-based catalysts may be more than a year off.FedEx is a leading provider of a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. FDX has 261 million shares outstanding and net debt of $15.3 billion at the end of FY2019 (ended May 31). At $160 per share, the EV for FDX is approximately $57 billion. Comparatively, UPS, FDX’s competitor, has 859 million shares outstanding and net debt of $16 billion at the end of 2Q2019. At $120 per share, the EV for UPS is $119 billion. These data are summarized in Table 1 together with revenue, EV/revenue and EV/EBITDA information.Table 1: Comparison of selected valuation metrics for FDX and UPS.(Source: 10-K and 10-Q reports)FDX provides its customers with its services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively under the FedEx brand. The company has four reporting segments (independently operating companies): Express, Ground, Freight and Services. The segment revenue and segment operating profits for FY2019 are shown in Figure 1. The figure shows that the Express segment (which includes Express and TNT) has more than half the revenue, but the Ground segment is far more profitable.Figure 1: FDX FY2019 revenue and operating profit by segment. The operating profit for the Services segment is negligible in comparison with the other segments. (Source: 10-K)FDX shares peaked in January 2018 at around $270 per share and have recently declined to $160, down about 40%. UPS has seen its shares dropped 10% over the same period.In the FY2019 4Q CC, management disclosed several items that do not add to investor confidence. First, management characterized FY2020, ending May 31, 2020, to be a “transition year,” telegraphing that issues that it is working on will not bear fruits in FY2020. Second, it is targeting a mid-single digit percentage decrease in adjusted earnings per share. Third, the TNT integration is projected to cost $200 million more than management’s forecast just last quarter, and the integration will extend into FY2021. Fourth, there will be no dividend increase in FY2020, and share buybacks will be significantly dialed back. As a result of these setbacks, the shares have lingered in a trading range around $160 per share and a comparatively lower valuation as compared to UPS.Figure 2 shows the operating margin for FDX compared with UPS. The FY for UPS ends on December 31, while FDX’s FY ends on May 31. In Figure 2, the UPS data that correspond to the FDX FY are those for the year ending the prior December. For example, I used UPS’s 2018 data to compare with FDX’s FY2019 data. I have used this same approach for all data comparison in this article.Figure 2: UPS is consistently more profitable than FDX. (Source: 10-K reports)Figure 2 shows that UPS has significantly higher operating profits compared to FDX. I will explore this issue later. The figure also shows that since FY2016, FDX’s operating margin has declined. The profit decline is caused by many factors, the two most prominent ones being the macro factors affecting trade lanes between the US and its trade partners and the drag on profitability due to the TNT integration and TNT's performance.The operating profit by segment of FDX is shown in Figure 3. The company acquired TNT Express in May 2016 and TNT’s results are included in the Express segment. TNT’s results had no material contribution to the results of the Express segment in FY2016, but have impacted the results of Express significantly since. For example, in FY2017, Express reported a segment operating margin of 7.0%. On a standalone basis, Express would have reported a segment operating margin of 9.8% (slightly better than the 9.5% reported for FY2016) and TNT would have reported a segment operating margin of 1.1%. The results of Express continued to struggle since the TNT acquisition.Figure 3: FDX segment operating margin.(Source: 10-K reports)TNT Express was attacked in June 2017 by the NotPetya cyber attack. By early 2018, investors began to be concerned with the extent of the damage and the effect on results and integration. No one outside of FDX knows the full extent of the damage. Investor can surmise that the damage was very severe based on how FDX management characterized the impact during the FY2019 4Q CC: “had it not been that TNT had been a subsidiary of FedEx, the company would've been bankrupt. It would have just gone out of business.” Outside of the business disruption caused by the cyber attack, there are other issues that caused the continued decline of Express’ profitability: the additional cost in integrating TNT and the declining health of the EU and Chinese economies. Trade wars against many trading partners, particularly China, EU, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, have weighed on results as well.Figure 2 shows that FDX consistently has lower profitability than UPS. I have attempted to analyze and estimate the yield and cost of shipping a comparable package to understand the cause of FDX’s lower operating margin. The segmentation of the business is different for the two companies, making it difficult to conduct such an analysis. For those segments where a comparison can be made (with certain assumptions), yield data did not consistently point to an advantage for UPS.One clue is the consistently lower asset turnover for FDX as shown in Figure 4. Given that FedEx Ground purchases most of its transportation as a service, the results shown in Figure 4 are even more surprising. My hypothesis for the lower asset turnover for FDX is the silo-like independently operated structure of its segments. Most of the assets in each segment are not shared. For example, Express has its own hubs and sorting centers, and they are not shared by Ground. Similarly, Express has its own vehicles, and they are not shared by Ground. In the case of UPS, assets are shared across the different reporting segments. With a silo structure, it is possible that the business processes are different across segments, resulting in different IT systems to support the different business processes within each silo. Hence, it is possible that the silo structure of FDX causes a lower asset turnover. A higher asset level leads to a higher cost to operate the asset, and hence, a higher cost to ship a package.Figure 4: FedEx has lower asset turnover. (Source: 10-K reports)If that is the case, it may be very costly to change this structure and it will take a long time to implement a change to share assets, as legacy business processes have to be changed. Making such a change will very likely cause huge disruption to the operation of the business as well. As such, I expect this structural disadvantage to continue.Figure 5 compares the cash flow (""CF"") results of FDX and UPS. Figure 5 shows that both companies are quite competitive in their ability to convert EBITDA to CF from OPS. However, UPS is consistently converting a higher level of FCF from its CF from OPS. As FCF is CF from OPS less CapEx, it is clear that FDX is consistently investing a higher level of CapEx in its business. This is consistent with a lower level of asset turnover that I discussed earlier.Figure 5: FDX’s FCF conversion is lower.(Source: 10-K reports)Figure 5 also shows that the FCF level has been meager for FDX in the last three years. The company has been borrowing to fund its dividend and share repurchase. Beefing up the pension plan has also been a call on CF in FY2019.Figure 6 shows the comparison of net debt/EBITDA. By this measure, both companies have similar leverage. FedEx is rated BBB by Standard & Poor's and Baa2 by Moody's. The company’s credit rating is one notch above the minimum of the investment grade. It is likely that FDX desires to keep its investment grade rating. Hence, to conserve cash and minimize fixed charges, management announced that there will be no increase in the dividend and only limited share repurchase in FY2020.Figure 6. Net debt/EBITDA ratio has grown for both companies.(Source: 10-K reports)As a side note, UPS has seen its credit rating downgraded recently from A1 to A2 by Moody’s. Hence, UPS may have to dial back its dividend increase and share repurchase as well.Since FDX consists of basically three independent companies, it is rather simple to estimate the value of each business if data for comparable peers are available. For Express and Ground, I use data from UPS. For Freight, I use other LTL and logistics companies such as XPO Logistics (XPO), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) and Saia Inc. (SAIA) as peers.FDX Ground is the crown jewel of the company. It consistently outgrows UPS’s Domestic Ground and is more profitable than UPS Domestic (Domestic Ground is over 70% of the revenue of the Domestic reporting segment). This is shown in Figure 7. FDX Ground also grows faster than UPS as a whole and is more profitable at the UPS overall operating margin level.Figure 7: Comparison between FDX Ground and UPS Domestic.(Source: 10-K reports)As shown in Figure 1 above, Ground represents less than 30% of FDX’s revenue, but it contributes almost 50% of the operating profit. With its consistently high growth rate, being highly profitable, and an outsourced transportation model, Ground deserves a high multiple. With reference to the multiples of UPS shown in Table 1, I use the UPS multiples as the minimum for Ground. I also assign multiples for Express that are significantly lower than those of UPS's to account for the integration issues at TNT and the lower margins at TNT.For Freight, the comparable data are shown in Table 2 below. Figure 2 shows that FedEx Freight is the largest LTL and logistics company in the US, growing faster than its peers, and is comparably profitable.Table 2: Comparable data used for Freight’s multiples.(Source: Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha)The above-mentioned data and assumptions provide the basis for my estimation for the high and low end of FDX’s EV and share price valuation. The results are shown in Table 3 below. The estimation put the value of FDX shares between $240 and $300, significantly above its price of $160 today. This means that FDX's shares could be undervalued by as much as 47%. It is worth noting that based on the estimation in Table 3, the combined Ground and Freight value accounts for almost all the current FDX EV of $57 billion. This means that current investors are getting Express almost for free.Table 3: Estimation of EV and share price of FDX. (Source: Author’s estimation based on data presented in various places in this article)Closing the valuation gap will take time. The TNT integration is projected to extend into FY2021 and may cost more. Even after the completion of the integration, improving results in Express will take time. Management has not provided guidance regarding when CapEx will taper and when FCF will increase. Nonetheless, when investors can see inflection of these issues, the valuation gap may start to close. Outside of execution issues, investors are discounting FDX shares because of several external risks described below.The economy of the EU has been declining. China’s economic growth is decelerating. While the US is still growing, there is growing concern that the US economy will slow as a result of the trade war and tariffs. FDX’s business is very sensitive to the global B2B business and could be impacted further.FedEx may become a casualty in the trade war between the US and China. China investigated FedEx for mishandling Huawei shipments as well as shipping ""controlled knives"" to Hong Kong. Investors have raised concern that FedEx may be put on China’s ""unreliable entity list,"" impacting its business in and out of that country.Pension liability will continue to impact earnings and CF. In FY2019, FedEx has to borrow to fund over $3 billion of deficit in its pension plan. With interest rates declining and with the stock market stagnant, investors are concerned that the funding gap may cause further earnings and CF impact in FY2020 and beyond.With Amazon (AMZN) building up its aircraft fleet and its local delivery network, it may get into package delivery and logistics services and compete with FDX. With AMZN’s approach of “your margin is my opportunity,” AMZN may become the ultimate disrupter of the package shipment and logistics business. This is probably one reason why FDX has not renewed its contract for domestic Express handling of AMZN’s shipments.Continued compression of Ground yield due to lighter weight and shorter shipping distance of e-commerce packages is another risk. As e-commerce continues to grow, shippers are working to reduce their shipping cost. One approach to reduce shipping cost is to ship from their local stores and warehouses, thereby compressing shipping distance. B2C packages are generally less bulky and less heavy compared to B2B packages. However, the cost of delivering a package, especially in the last mile, does not decline because of lower weight. Hence, the growth in e-commerce has compressed Ground’s yield and will continue to do so. FDX has recognized this challenge and is working to reduce its cost in order to reduce the impact on its margin.FDX shares are deeply undervalued as a result of execution issues as well as investors’ perceived risks that are beyond the company's control. Since improvement in results will likely be very gradual in FY2020 and inflection may not happen until FY2021, it is unlikely that catalysts will come from its results in the near term. Easing of some of the external risks may provide some support, but the timing of these catalysts is very difficult to predict."
4266241,104579,2019-05-23T20:20:47-04:00,FedEx operates in a virtual duopoly and should continue to benefit from continued infrastructure investments.The shares have pulled back to quite attractive levels given the risks.The stock will ultimately rise in the long run as rate increases and market share gains are beneficial to earnings.,"SourceFedEx (FDX) has seen its shares drop rather quickly and unjustifiably. The only news we know is that the head of the Express division announced his retirement unexpectedly, and there is a potential economic slowdown although it is not showing up anywhere on U.S. soil or economic data besides housing.Consumer spending is still strong and FedEx guided higher last quarter, leaving me to believe that unless the company guides downward in the upcoming earnings report, the stock is really oversold. The company really just needs to confirm its outlook and the stock should rise back to where it was a few weeks ago. In the meantime, investors would be wise to take advantage of the unjust sell-off.FedEx reported third-quarter earnings that were weaker than anticipated.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company reported slight revenue growth, however, missed earnings estimates by $0.07. The company cited slower macroeconomic growth and global spending as a main cause for the drop in top-line revenue growth. However, the company continues to focus on a number of initiatives to reduce costs, drive earnings, and win market share. While operating income grew in the quarter due to lower fueling costs and compensation costs, the company introduced 6-days-a-week operations year round to help improve customer experiences. Some of the earnings have adjustments involved in relation to tax benefits and the integration costs of TNT. These will eventually feather out and leave us with a much clearer picture of the company's operating performance.A better picture of the company's performance can be seen below.SourceThe company recognized and adjusted earnings decline of almost 19%. This was partially due to last year's recognition of a tax benefit for pension contributions adding $0.75 per share and the TCJA adding $0.44 per share. When adjusted for these one-time items, the earnings weren't that bad.What is worrisome is the company did cut its outlook only one quarter after raising it. This either means the company can be quickly affected by trade and or a slight slowdown or the management team does not have as a great of insight into the business as it should.FedEx is now forecasting the following for fiscal 2019:This was compared to the prior quarter's forecast of earnings of $15.85 to $16.45 per diluted share before year-end MTM retirement plan accounting adjustments. Quite the cut in earnings guidance which may be due to the management wanting an easy target to beat. However, it could be argued that the company should never have raised its forecast in the first place. This should have only been done if there had been a trade deal signed that would have led to imminent growth and improved macroeconomic conditions.The company also has a strong balance sheet but did see it move in a not so shareholder friendly direction during the quarter.Source: 10-QSource: 10QThe company saw cash improve quarter over quarter but still below year-ago levels. It did also see a debt increase both sequentially and year over. With approximately $2.87 billion in cash versus $17.2 billion in total debt, the company stands with a net debt position that is around $14.33 billion. Nothing to be alarmed about as a deeper look reveals this is less than 2x EBITDA/Debt leverage and since the company continues to grow its EBITDA at a healthy pace there is not much to worry about here.The company continues to offer a broad range of services, making it a leading selection by its customers to be the shipper of choice.Source: Investor PresentationAs Express continues to make up a large portion of sales, it is beneficial that retail pressures have continued to lead to greater demand for faster shipping. The recent announcement of one-day shipping for the largest retailer on the planet will help contribute to the continued growth of this division. It also helps FedEx is a much faster shipper in comparison to competitors.An additional source of growth investors should look forward to is price increases. Source: Investor PresentationAlong with volume growth, price increases will help pay for additional capital investment, to grow revenue and grow margin. Margin can be affected by such things as oil prices which the company can charge surcharges for, but recently oil has turned around and went higher. It has since stabilized but it could hit the bottom line more than expected.While FedEx continues to grow, it continues to do so by being better at its job. Source: Investor PresentationBy being faster and sometimes even cheaper, the company has room to grow its pricing as well as its customer base. Having faster routes in a day and age where Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the consumer expectant of 2-day and soon to be 1-day deliveries is an advantage that deserves a premium. This is also beneficial in marketing efforts to win new business and continue to capture the growing e-commerce sales that omni-channel retailers are so focused on. However, it should be noted that the net FedEx advantage has decreased from the last analysis which noted a 25.9% advantage.As you can see, the trend for e-commerce sales is ever-increasing.Source: StatistaI prefer to benefit from this trend by owning shares in FedEx rather than any one retailer who can suffer from consistent market share battle. FedEx operates in a competitive environment but really it is a duopoly. Anything over 1lb in net weight is ideal to ship via FedEx or UPS (UPS). Because of this, they are the only two domestic players to compete with each other.Additionally, the company has increased its market share for almost 20 years and it can be attributed to continued investments in its network.Source: Investor PresentationAs the company looks to add Saturday deliveries, this trend should improve further and capacity won't need to be added to gain anymore share. The ROI on this should be huge.Another attractive perk of FedEx is that it continues to grow its LTL or less than truckload share. Source: Investor PresentationThis is an important segment as it offers integration for customers with large and small shipments. Though its competitor offers similar services FedEx is the only one with market share growth. The company has, however, seen a dip in operating margins which brings into question the ability to win share on metrics other than pricing.This is the last mile service that companies like XPO Logistics (XPO) have been trying to grow in. As retailers try to ship larger and larger items and eliminate the need for in-store pick-up, FedEx will continue to gain share. This is another beneficial item coming from omni-channel retail.Now, there are some concerns related to global trade which have impacted the business. The company states that it will be hurt by a slowdown in trade, but I believe this issue will be resolved in the medium term, allowing the company to resume its strong growth. Investors should keep an eye on the earnings report for any potentially significant impact in the last quarter due to tariffs, but I expect there to be minimal impact at this time. Any positive news regarding tariffs should also help lift the stock higher.Also, recent concerns due to Amazon have further punished the stock. Let's be clear, Amazon does not account for more than 2-3% of FedEx sales. On top of that, this part of the sales have low margins attached. On top of it all, part of these sales are attributed to third-party sellers obtaining FedEx discounted rates when sending in products to be fulfilled by Amazon. Amazon does not have the capability or the network to replace this service.It also would take a significant amount of time to replicate the network at a cost-efficient manner to send products to virtually the entire country. Even if we saw just investments from Amazon in the major metro markets from which a heavy amount of sales are driven, it would potentially put at risk 1% of sales from FedEx in my estimates. It also would probably not be that cost-effective since the company would be purely using its own shipping services for its own sales channel and not providing shipping services for anyone else.Because of this, the company would not ideally have efficient routes. The threat of Amazon as a shipping competitor is really overblown. It should be noted that other retailers are gaining traction in their online sales and should continue to grow with FedEx negating any possible loss of sales with Amazon. Additionally, Amazon would have to ship to every possible part of the nation in order to compete with FedEx before it lost 100% of its business with Amazon. This would be many decades out at the very least. This is a minimal risk at this time.FedEx's valuation is now very attractive. From its own 5-year trading history there has not been a better time to buy.Source: MorningstarThe P/E is less than 1/2 that of its average, its P/B, P/CF, PEG ratio, and P/S all show it is below average and below anywhere we could get shares recently. It is also lower than the last time we reviewed shares of FedEx.Furthermore, looking at the yield, we can see even if it returned to an abnormal compelling yield of 0.75%, the stock would be 62% higher. The shares now offer the highest yield since March of 2009.Source: Yield ChartDespite no ""Great Recession"" in sight, the stock is acting as if there is one.Looking at the daily RSI, we can see shares have an RSI of 25, which is below the typical oversold metric of 30.Source: StockchartsSo how does FedEx compare to its peer UPS?YChartsWell, it appears that once again FedEx is cheaper on the above metrics, leading me to believe that even if the stock was down due to a market sell-off, the shares are below their less formidable peer. However, UPS does offer a more attractive yield to those who like the dividend income.I may once again enter shares of FedEx after the recent sell-off. I last had to sell my position for the tax loss benefit. I have been watching shares for over a year now and am amazed at the willingness of the market to overlook a superbly managed company operating in a space with limited competition. The growth story remains intact, the economy is still doing quite well, and the fears of Amazon are clearly overblown. Due to these factors, we have however seen shares sell off to levels that have not been seen in the last 5 years.I call it how I see it and I believe this is an opportunity for those looking for growth at a reasonable price. Also, investors can take joy in knowing every time they get a delivery from FedEx, they are earning money on their investment. I believe once management confirms guidance in the upcoming earnings report, we will see a move higher. If for any reason the earnings report is negative, I am not sure that the stock could fall much further as it already seems to be pricing in any negative news possible. For now, I will continue to take the opportunity to add shares to my portfolio."
4249484,32001,2019-03-18T12:35:28-04:00,"FDX management pulled 2019 revenue and operating income guidance from the December 2018 conference call.FDX's stock is down from $274 in January 2018 to $178 as of March 15, 2019.The US market was still healthy last quarter, but the China and Europe outlook sunk the guidance.The stock is undervalued, but is it trading at a 10% or 30% discount to intrinsic value?","FedEx Corp. (FDX), the iconic transport and freight giant that transformed package delivery in the United States, reports their fiscal Q3 '19 earnings on Tuesday night, March 19th, 2019, after the closing bell.Street consensus per IBES by Refinitiv is looking for $3.17 in earnings per share on $17.69 billion in revenue for an expected y/y decline in earnings per share of 15% on 7% y/y growth in revenue.FDX's management had not only pulled revenue and operating guidance for the two quarters remaining in fiscal 2019, they had also pulled the update, saying that they would have more to say in the March 2019 quarter.The current fiscal 2019 consensus (ended May 2019) is expecting 3% EPS growth on 8% revenue growth, which is down from 26% EPS growth last year on 8% revenue growth.FDX has lost roughly $25 billion in market cap since its January-February 2018 high near $270, from $69-$70 billion to roughly $45 billion in market cap today, but with Brexit drawing closer to a conclusion, after this week, and the prospects for a trade deal with China also looking like something might happen by the summer of 2019......Is the stock a better value today than in early 2018? Well, given the $90 drop in the share price in just over 14 months, you'd certainly say ""yes"", but it's a matter of degrees with FedEx as they continue to be plagued with a dearth of free cash flow generation, and a business with the kind of operating leverage FedEx has, it can look cheap and not be, and then look expensive and not be either.Trading at 0.66x 4-quarter trailing revenue and 11x lowered 2019 EPS, FDX usually trades at a growth rate in excess of its PE, probably due to the operating leverage, but FDX is trading at 11x expected 2019 EPS for 3% expected growth at present.Let's look at margins:Source: internal valuation spreadsheetFDX does a great job with their quarterly earnings report, disclosing all the relevant detail for investors in the quarterly packet.Back in the 1990s and early 2000s when FDX's operating margin saw challenges, it usually meant it was time to sell the stock, but with the ascendance of FedEx Ground, which is roughly 25% of revenue but half of operating income, I do think FDX's operating margin has more room to expand to the upside, if they can get TNT straightened out.Morningstar doesn't agree with me, since they see long-run EBIT margins in the 7%-8% range and the consolidated operating margin (over the 5-10 year period) also in the 7.5%-8% range, but in my opinion that's too low.The key for FDX to accomplish the margin expansion is that they will have to drive more volume over the same level or lower costs, which is what really drives EPS delta for businesses with a high degree of operating leverage. With the Ground business, they can do that over time, and the Express business will likely need to see more costs come out of the P/L (and that's much easier said that done).Here is the real longer-term issue for FDX:Here is a quick table of FDX's historical free cash flow:Source: internal spreadsheet, 10-Qs, annual reportsAs readers can quickly see, the dearth of free cash flow for FDX limits the ability of the freight giant to pay any kind of a dividend, and also limits anything but debt-financed share repurchases.Capex has to fall or cash flow has to grow for FDX to solve this riddle.Fred Smith, the great CEO and founder of FedEx, noted on the September 2018 call that ""free cash flow was on the way,"" but then calendar Q4 '18 happened, thus by pulling guidance for the last 2 quarters of fiscal 2019, any hint of free cash flow growth was shelved.Analysis/conclusion: FDX is down 35% from its early 2018 peak near $270-$275 in a market where the S&P 500 is roughly flat, so the stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, and that interests me.If readers have a 2019-2020 time horizon, I do think with a potential end to Brexit and China trade discussions in the next 3 months, and the Fed on hold for the rest of 2019, we should see volume start to return to Europe and China in the next quarter or two.It would be important to hear FDX's management on the conference call Tuesday night give commentary on Europe and China volumes and how they may have changed since the December 2018 call, particularly since both geographies were cited on the December 2018 call.The stock has rallied in calendar 2019 with the general rally in the S&P 500, which is up 13% year-to-date, so any weakness in FDX after the Tuesday night results, we will add to current positions in the stock.There are a lot of moving parts to FDX, particularly with Brexit and China in the last year, but crude oil price changes and changes in the US and global economy, not to mention the operating leverage inherent in a Transport cyclical like FDX make for an investment nail-biter, but the drop in the stock price discounts a lot of bad news in my opinion.Morningstar cut their ""intrinsic value"" estimate on FDX from $260 to $210 following the December 2018 conference call, which i think is indicative of the bearish sentiment around the name, but not surprising given the operating leverage of the company.Investors could see $225 on FDX in 18-24 months, again with any kind of resolution around China. At least we know that with Brexit it won't be a ""hard"" exit (or at least that is how I took the latest vote last week), so anything that reduces the uncertainty of what the UK and EU might look like from a trade perspective, should help volume improve across the European geography."
4250736,44781,2019-03-25T04:28:41-04:00,"Down more than 35% from recent highs, FDX shares look attractive to me.Slowing economic growth has hurt FY19 guidance - guidance is down ~11% while the stock price is down ~35%.Competition and debt on the balance sheet are cause for concern, but I think the valuation and prospects for multiple expansion moving forward outweigh the risks.I wouldn't want FDX to be one of my largest holdings due to the apparent risks, but I am happy to own a full position and I'd be willing to add to that position should FDX approach recent 52-week lows again.","In late 2018/early 2019, finding attractive values in the stock market wasn’t very difficult to do. However, we’ve experienced a fairly sharp, “V” shaped recovery thus far throughout 2019 and now that we’re approaching prior all-time highs, I’m finding it more and more difficult to spot enticing buying opportunities. This is why I get excited when I see a high quality company like FedEx (FDX) sell off after an earnings report. Prior to the recent, post earnings sell-off, FDX shares were already trading weak, down more than 30% from their all-time highs. Well, when you combine a beaten-down stock with a quick 5% drop, you might have the recipe for a buying opportunity. Yet, you might not. That’s what I’ll be trying to decide in this piece.I’m currently long FedEx and I’m content to hold those shares for the long term. I’m very bullish on the prospects of the logistics space as a whole, looking out far into the future. Granted, I have to admit that even if there are strong, secular tailwinds behind the names in this space, there is also a good chance for the road to be bumpy in the short term because while I think trends like globalization, urbanization, and the continued rise of e-commerce should continue to increase demand/volume for the shippers, the rate of this growth will fluctuate alongside the health (or lack there of) of the global economy.So, if you agree with me about the long-term growth prospects of the logistics space, it would make sense to take advantage of short-term weakness in one of the major players in the industry, right? Buying into weakness can be a scary process, yet buying low (and either holding or selling high) is how wealth is generated in the markets. In my experience, steep sell-offs like the one that FDX has experienced lately are generally overdone. Once fear takes hold of the market, irrational decisions are made. People rush to the exits, forgetting about the quality of the asset that they’re selling. Naysayers come out of the woodworks, professing all sorts of dire outcomes for the falling stock. Fear compounds itself and eventually gets out of the control.In a situation like this, fundamentals, in the short term, at least, are thrown out of the window. This is why timing bottoms is so difficult to do. Prior levels of support sometimes provide resistance to the sell-off, but other times they don’t. Furthermore, stocks can (and do) trade at irrational valuations for long periods of time. Whether we’re talking about fear or exuberance, it takes time for level-headed, rational thinkers to re-take the day. Eventually, most things revert to their means. As a value investor, this is how I make a lot of my money in the markets (taking advantage of short-term, irrational thinking and waiting patiently for the mean reversion to happen). But, short-term movement in a stock is always unpredictable and therefore, I think it’s always best to move into and out of positions slowly, spreading your risk out over the time horizon a bit.With this in mind, I’ve got to decide if now is the time to begin moving further into FedEx stock? When thinking about this, the first thing to do is to understand the risk(s) that is sparking the fear in the broader market. While I think reactions are generally taken too far in the stock market, I’m not going to be naïve about risk. Fear is usually founded in a logical place before it’s taken elsewhere. So, in FedEx’s case, what inspired the recent sell-off?In short: negative guidance.Unfortunately, this has been a bit of a trend for FedEx in recent quarters. This is why the stock is down so far from its high of ~$265 set last summer. Here’s what CFO Alan Graf had to say about FY19 guidance back in September of last year during the Q1 conference call:When Smith said that, the stock was still trading near the highs, around $255. Well, flash forward to the Q2 CC which was held on December 18th and we see that Graf’s tune had changed, fairly rapidly. Here’s his comment on the company’s updated FY19 guidance:During the Q2 call, CEO Fred Smith also chimed in on the company’s changing outlook, saying:It’s interesting to me that 9 months to a year ago, we were mostly talking about synchronous global growth and a Federal Reserve that was raising rates to tamper down an overheating economy. Well, flash forward to today and we’re looking at CEOs who are concerned with a global slowdown and a much more dovish Fed. Heck, certain analysts out there are actually calling for rate cuts in late 2019/early 2020. How quickly things have changed.Smith has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration trade policies in recent months. The slowdown of the Chinese economy due to sanctions/tariffs has overflowed into the region and become a contagion that has infected previously healthy economies across the globe. FedEx relies on many of these foreign markets for its growth (the U.S. logistics space is still growing due to technological disruption, but in general, it’s a much more mature market than other areas of the world where FedEx has made investments).Well, that tune didn’t change much in the most recent quarter. Smith highlighted the weakening global macroeconomic conditions serve times in the Q3 CC. However, I should note that he closed the call on a somewhat optimistic note and then followed through with that optimism for FY2020 during his Cramer interview on Tuesday night, which can be seen with this CNBC link.But, before we get to Smith’s Q3 comments, let’s stick to the program, starting with Graf and his guidance update. In the Q3 CC, he said this:And, here’s what Smith had to say about FDX’s outlook:So, as you can see, in the span of just 3 quarters, FY19 EPS outlook has fallen from $17.20-17.80 to $15.10-15.90. This is a fairly significant, ~11% reduction at the mid-point. And, while the fiscal year is almost complete, I still find it a bit curious that management is giving such a wide range. It appears to me that they don’t have a ton of clarity on the Q4 print. That is unsettling, but then again, as Smith has said many times, much of the issues that his company is facing are basically out of his control. He is making moves and cutting costs when able, but I suppose I can’t blame him for the unpredictable nature of global growth when much of these changes are fairly artificial, spawning from the U.S.’s somewhat protectionist policies. Because of the wide range, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a disappointment in Q4, meaning that the fall from the original annual guide to the final total could be more than 11%.Regardless, I don’t expect it to be much more than that and it’s important to note that while guidance has fallen and will likely end up being something like a low double-digit disappointment for the year, the stock’s price is down significantly more than that. Right now, FDX’s share price is down some 33% since the original FY19 was given in Q1. This gap between lowered guidance (~11%) and lowered share price (~33%) is exactly the type of overreaction that I spoke about in the beginning of this piece.So, where do we go from here?Let’s assume that Graf is correct and FDX hits the mid-point of its FY19 guidance at $15.50. Well, at $173/share, we’re talking about a stock that is trading for just 11.2x earnings. That’s well below the broader market’s multiple. It’s also below the multiple currently assigned to FDX’s largest peer/competitor, United Parcel Service (UPS), which is currently trading with a 15x multiple.Even though a $15.50 EPS print will be a disappointment relative to the original FY19 guidance, it’s still worth noting that it would represent ~1% growth y/y. Now, am I excited about 1% growth? Of course not. But, then again, when a stock is priced with such a bargain barrel valuation, I’m surprised to see any growth at all. To me, FDX is priced as if it is going out of business. Granted, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but you get my point. This company is likely to still post growth (albeit, slow growth) and this, combined with the fact that analysts on the Street are still calling for double-digit growth in 2020 and 2021 (which seems to echo Smith’s recently highlighted position for FY2020), gets me excited about the value proposition that FDX offers down here.Take a look at this F.A.S.T. Graph. If you’re still wondering whether or not FDX is undervalued at the moment, it might clear some things up for you. Look at the discrepancy between FDX’s value today and its long-term average value. Rarely in the long history of this company has there ever been such a divergence. Once again, this sort of pricing seems to point towards massive disruption along the way and a long-term trend of negative growth. Simply put, I don’t see that happening.Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs While I wouldn’t be surprised to see the global economy continue to struggle a bit with the U.S. and China still involved in a trade spat, I don’t necessarily think that we’re in for another 08/09-like economic meltdown. I’ve heard a lot of calls for an earnings recession in the coming quarters, but most noted analysts that I follow remain fairly bullish into the short and medium term. Without a major meltdown, I think it’s likely that FDX finds its footing and returns to bottom-line growth.Furthermore, I know that many investors are concerned about rising competition in the logistics space coming in the form of Amazon (AMZN). Well, while AMZN may be willing to spend billions to build out its own logistical infrastructure, I highly doubt that this is going to have a major impact on FDX’s global volumes. FDX does a ton of B2B shipping and while that is a major market that AMZN would love to penetrate, it’s worth noting that a lot of those customers are competitors to AMZN and I highly doubt that AMZN’s direct competitors are going to be willing to hand over money to Mr. Bezos’ operation.Also, with volume and pricing trends in the logistics space continuing to rise, I think there is enough room for another major player in the space. I’m sure that FDX/UPS would rather continue to dominate this growing market and I’m sure that investors would rather not see AMZN, which has been known to dominate areas it enters (I harken back to the Bezos quote, “your margin is my opportunity.”), start to play in the same sandbox as FDX/UPS. But ultimately, I still think that FDX will be able to grow alongside AMZN and UPS. So, once again, I don’t think this near single-digit P/E multiple is justified.And lastly, we come to another issue that certain investors like to bring up when it comes to FDX: its balance sheet. FDX has credit rating (BBB according to Standard and Poor's) that I’d like to see improve. The company took on debt when it made the TNT deal in 2016. Right now, that deal is looking rather poor with Europe’s economy looking unwell. Integration is proving to be more costly than originally thought and TNT isn’t bolstering the top/bottom lines like some suspected it would. However, I still like the move long-term. I think scale generates a moat in this industry and I’m happy to see FDX management focusing on foreign growth opportunities.Right now, FDX has ~$17b of long-term debt on the balance sheet. During the trailing 12 months, this figure has risen. Rising debt is cause for concern. Management is well-known for its shareholder returns (FDX has posted strong, double-digit dividend growth in recent years while spending billions on a share buyback), but those activities may not be sustainable in the long term if the company doesn’t get its balance sheet in order.FDX’s free cash flows have come in at $1.4b during the trailing 12 months. The company's operational cash flows are much higher, at $6.8b. However, recent investments that FDX has made result in high capex. Long term, FDX’s willingness to invest in itself is why it has been able to post better growth than UPS. However, management does need to be careful here because this company has generated negative FCF in recent years and that’s not exactly where you want to be as a DGI stock.While I’m bullish on FDX from an operational and valuation perspective, the balance sheet concerns do give me pause when it comes to overweighting this stock in my portfolio. As I said before, I’m happy to own FDX shares, but I wouldn’t want to make this one of the biggest holdings in my portfolio. Right now, my FDX weighting is full. I made a few purchases on the way down during the recent sell-off (at $200.15 and $187.06), but for me to add to this position, I’m going to see an even wider margin of safety.I like the fact that the stock found support in the $150-160 range back in December. Should FDX shares fall that low again, I’d be willing to buy a few more. But, until then, I’m content to hold onto the ones that I have and wait for a turnaround. I think Smith is a top-notch CEO and I believe that FDX can meet analyst expectations and return to double-digit growth. If that happens to be the case in FY2020, I wouldn’t be surprised in the least to see FDX shares trade back up to the $200 area (or beyond). Yet, the balance sheet does present risk, so I’m not going to dive into this one head first.However, if I wasn’t already long, I’d be more than happy to buy shares at this level. So, what do you think? Are you adding to your position? Selling shares? Staying put? Are you concerned about the debt load or competition? Or, do you suspect to see a ~$17.00 EPS print in 2020? As always, I’m looking forward to hearing everyone’s opinion on this stock.Until next time, best wishes all!This article was previously published for members of The Dividend Growth Club."
4249224,20715,2019-03-16T03:26:21-04:00,"FedEx is set to release fiscal third-quarter earnings results after the close on Tuesday.The company has grown earnings and sales at a pretty good pace over the last few years, but earnings are expected to fall this time.The stock has underperformed the market in the past year.","Shipping and transportation giant FedEx (FDX) saw its stock fall over 40% from its peak in January of 2017 through its low in December. The stock was hit particularly hard in December, falling over 29% during the month. Now the company is set to release its third-quarter results for fiscal 2019 on Tuesday, and investors are hoping that the stock can start a new uptrend.Analysts expect FedEx to earn $3.17 per share for the quarter and that estimate has dropped from $3.19 in the last 30 days. The company earned $3.72 per share in the third quarter of 2018, so analysts are expecting a year-over-year decline of 14.8%.The consensus revenue estimate is at $17.69 billion and that represents an increase of 7% over the third quarter of 2018.Over the last three years, FedEx has been able to grow earnings at a rate of 19% per year and earnings grew by 27% in the second quarter. Sales grew by an average of 13% per year over the last three years, and they were up by 9% in the second quarter.Based on analysts' estimates for EPS and revenue, earnings are expected to decline and sales are expected to increase at a rate similar to the last few years.The company's return on equity is good at 23.5%, but the profit margin is a little below average at 8.0%.I find it interesting that FedEx uses different hedging strategies to eliminate the risk of rising fuel prices, and yet during the fourth quarter when FedEx's stock was falling sharply, oil prices were falling just as sharply. The hedging strategies could be affecting the management's efficiency and profitability measurements.FedEx had been trending higher within the confines of an upward sloped trend channel from early 2016, but the stock broke out of the channel to the downside in July of last year. As I mentioned before, the stock was hit especially hard in December, and we see that on the chart below. The stock dropped sharply for three straight weeks, and it was during the third week of declines that the company made its second quarter earnings announcement.When FedEx announced earnings on December 18, the stock had already fallen by almost 20% in the month of December. The second-quarter earnings report came up short of estimates, and that caused the final leg down before bouncing back. The bounce in FedEx has pretty much mirrored that of the overall market.A couple of developments were causing FedEx to fall in December. First, there was another round of fear being stoked about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bumping up its own freight and delivery capabilities. These stories have been around for several years and they seem to come in cycles.Amazon has made it clear that it wants to lower its delivery costs and that it intends to expand its own capabilities. Those plans date back to at least 2017, but the fears were stoked again as an analyst from Morgan Stanley issued a note to investors on December 4. The analyst stated: ""We think the market is missing the risk Amazon Air poses to UPS/FDX growth.""In addition to the renewed fears of Amazon Air, Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded FedEx on December 10, and it lowered the price target from $304 to $220. Between the downgrade from BOAML, the cautious note from Morgan Stanley, and the fear of Amazon taking business away from FedEx, it was enough to drive the stock down ahead of the earnings report.One thing that concerns me about FedEx is that the sentiment hardly changed after the dramatic decline in the stock price. Looking at the analysts' ratings from the Wall Street Journal, we see that there are 24 ""buy"" ratings and four ""hold"" ratings currently. The only thing that has changed in the last three months is there is one less ""buy"" rating.The short interest ratio is at 2.23 currently and that is lower than I expected for a stock that declined as much as FedEx did. Compared to the average short interest ratio, FedEx's is a little low, but not enough to consider it extremely low. The number of shares sold short did drop from 3.63 million to 3.28 million from the mid-February reading to the reading at the end of February.The put/call ratio is currently at 0.96 and that is indicative of a slightly pessimistic view from option traders. There are 65,963 puts open at this time and 68,365 calls open. The stock sees average trading volume of 1.47 million, and the open interest represents 13.4 million shares, so it is statistically significant.Collectively, we have analysts who are pretty bullish with 24 out of 28 ratings falling in the ""buy"" level. The short interest ratio is a slightly skewed to the bullish side as well, but the put/call ratio is slightly skewed toward the bearish side.FedEx's fundamentals are good, but not great. From a technical perspective, the stock has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past year, and that is based on the relative strength rating of 11 from Investor's Business Daily.Obviously the concern about losing business from and to Amazon is weighing on the stock. The company is also getting hurt by the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The company made a statement about the trade dispute impacting its business when it released earnings back in September.Personally, I think the trade dispute is a bigger problem than Amazon. We have seen Amazon announce that it was entering into other industries and it disrupts the normal flow of the business; we saw it when Amazon bought Whole Foods and the impact it had on the grocery business. But the impact on the shipping business is different. To my knowledge, Amazon isn't planning to get shipping business from retailers it is competing against; it is planning to ship its own merchandise. I can't see Target (NYSE:TGT) or Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) using Amazon to ship goods to customers when they are competing against Amazon to get the business in the first place.The trade dispute is having more of an immediate impact. According to the statement from September, FedEx generates approximately 2% of its overall revenue from China. The note from Morgan Stanley cautioned that the shift by Amazon to shipping more of its own goods was a ""potential"" 2% loss of revenue for FedEx.Even with that, I would give FedEx a ""market"" rating. The fundamentals aren't strong enough, and there isn't enough pessimism for the stock to beat the market over the next few quarters. The weakness in the stock in December may have been overdone, but the stock has moved with the market since then and that is what I expect from it for the immediate future.FedEx has moved lower after each of its last four earnings reports, so I wouldn't rush in to buy it ahead of the earnings report on Tuesday."
4236050,104941,2019-01-28T14:51:31-05:00,"One will emerge as the most dominant in the next 10 years, and it may not be the company that has dominated in the past.FedEx has demonstrated its commitment to reinvestment in its business; whereas, UPS has demonstrated its commitment to returning shareholder capital via buybacks and dividends.The analysis of the two companies offers a fantastic case study for understanding the different methods of returning shareholder capital.","I really enjoy this comparison because it provides, in my opinion, great insights into the age old question: how should a company's management return shareholder capital? For new investors and for seasoned investors alike, the answer is pretty much never cut and dry. Many variables must be factored into deciding whether to pay a dividend, or to plow the free cash flow back into growth initiatives, or to buyback shares so as to engineer earnings gains.Whether you're familiar with UPS and FedEx or considering buying or simply looking for a fantastic case study into return of capital to shareholders, I believe understanding the differences between these two companies can teach us a great deal about a management team's most prudent and judicious use of shareholder capital.For the past few decades, FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) have dominated the shipping and logistics business in the United States and abroad. Although new entrants, such as XPO Logistics (XPO), Amazon (AMZN) and numerous start ups, have recently made inroads, UPS and FedEx remain the incumbent leaders in the industry.Though the companies operate in the same industry, their business models are distinct. Whereas UPS generates most of its revenues from business in the U.S., notably from its Ground Segment (to which Amazon is becoming a competitor), FedEx generates nearly half of its revenues from its international operations via ""...FedEx’s fleet of more than 650 aircraft, which includes more than 100 Boeing widebodies.""To put it concisely, UPS operates primarily domestically; whereas, FedEx has a more international orientation. Each company has its pros and cons, but with the Amazon Death Star on the horizon in the U.S., UPS may be in grave danger. But we'll explore that in greater detail later.For now, let's get the comparison underway.In determining which company investors should buy, I plan to take an objective approach via a series of comparisons; at the end of which, I will tally the scores and provide my recommendation as to which logistics company is the best bet.Here are the points of evaluation I will use to determine a winner:Let the games begin!UPS currently trades at a premium relative to FedEx. Why is that the case? Well, for several reasons, not least of which is UPS's larger dividend, secured by strong margins and predictable cash flows. However, to value the company solely on its present cash flows and generous dividend is to misunderstand the purpose of a valuation or share price.The value of any asset is the present value of its future cash flows. Therefore, we must be forward looking to an extent in determining what we should pay for these companies. With this in mind, let's look at their current valuations and attempt to determine what the future might hold.Source: YChartsAs the graph illustrates, both companies currently trade at substantial discounts relative to their historic valuations. That can partially be attributed to the poor guidance given on the FedEx's last conference call, in which management stated that due to Europeanzone weakness and softening Asian business, earnings growth would not be as good as expected.Hence, both of their valuations have cratered as of late, creating fantastic opportunities for long term investors. But which of the two is the right way to play the temporary headwinds?Now if you follow me, you know I like to analyze companies on their price to levered free cash flow ratio (Share Price/(Cash From Ops - Capex - Any Lease Obligations)), so as to ascertain what price I'm paying for cash generated by the core business that can be returned to me, the shareholder, in whatever form or fashion.Due to recent financial irregularities for both companies, which I will delve into in greater detail later in the article, their price to free cash flow multiples currently don't offer a very reliable assessment, as free cash flow has become negative or negligible for both companies.So with that in mind, I chose to look at other variables surrounding UPS's premium valuation in comparison to FedEx. Here are a few reasons I believe UPS current holds this premium to FedEx.Source: YChartsUPS does pay a larger dividend, as the above chart illustrates; however, FedEx has been gaining ground, and the actual amount doesn't tell the whole story.Source: YChartsFedEx maintains a very low payout ratio in large part due to the way they manage their cash flows. Instead of returning capital entirely via dividends and buybacks, FedEx aggressively spends on capex. Although it seems FedEx has greater runway to grow its dividend, it actually currently maintains a negative Cash Payout Ratio (defined as Dividend Payment/Levered Free Cash Flow).As I said, this is the result of management's use of capital and the accounting peculiarities that arise when companies report their financials on a GAAP basis. Regardless, investors don't like the low dividend and don't like the negative free cash flow; therefore, they place a premium valuation on UPS.Source: YChartsUPS has historically had a stronger cash flow profile, boasting slightly higher margins and lower capex. The combination of higher margins and lower capex have allowed UPS to pay a large dividend, which is extremely secure, at least in the near term. As a result, the company has historically traded at a premium to FedEx.Since 2015, FedEx has experienced margin compression as a result of the acquisition of TNT Express, the dutch based shipping and logistics company, and the expenses thereof. Many bemoaned the lack of synergies between the two companies when the acquisition occurred, and the financials have further borne out that story via operating margin compression. In addition, changes in working capital (read: heavy spend on pension contributions), have decreased FedEx's operating cash flows. The combination of both factors, along with heavy capex spend, has caused FedEx's cash flows to decline to such an extent that they were negative for 2018.Source: YChartsAre cash flows the reason UPS trades at a premium? Most likely not as institutional investors, which make up around 73% of all shares held by the public, see these temporary financial headwinds and do not waiver in maintaining their holdings. There's no grave concern for survival FedEx's business despite their negative FCF.Instead, the premium is likely solely attributable to the dividend disparities between the two companies.Final Verdict On Valuation: FedEx Takes The VictoryUp until now, you're probably thinking, ""UPS has a solid cash flow profile and a strong, growing dividend. No wonder it trades at a premium to FedEx."" And you'd be right. What isn't reflected in what I've shared so far are the nuances of capital management that have led to FedEx actually being undervalued today relative to UPS; and therefore, the better valued company for those looking to buy or add to their logistics holdings.Valuations are mechanisms for determining what investors must pay for future cash flows; therefore, it's important to not look entirely at what was but also what will be.For evidence of what will be, let's look at some statistics.Take for example dividend growth over the last five years:Or perhaps revenue growth over the last 10 years:Source: YChartsOr perhaps capex as a percent of revenue over the last 10 years:Source: YChartsSeen from the vantage point of these statistics, it becomes apparent that Wall Street currently has it wrong.What appear to be positives for UPS could actually be seen as negatives, and what appear to be negatives for FedEx could actually be quite positive. FedEx has been running itself as a growth company; whereas, UPS has been running itself with complacence and certainty (never good qualities for business longevity).Furthermore, the strong cash flow profile that UPS has boasted is the result of management's decision to play it safe, or to be overly conservative, through suppressing capex and returning to shareholders via buybacks and dividends what should've been creatively reinvested into the business.Therefore, FedEx currently offers greater prospects for growth of its dividend, its revenues, and by extension, its share price, yet it trades at a discount to UPS, simply because Wall Street and investors are hooked on the immediacy of capital return by UPS.In the coming years, FedEx will likely surpass UPS in total revenues. This is the result of a management that has always taken a long term approach at FedEx. Whereas, UPS has lavished money on dividends and buybacks, while keeping capex well below operating cash flow, FedEx has consistently found routes for spending on growth and efficiency initiatives, forgoing large dividends and buybacks in the process (not entirely however). As a result, it seems highly possible that UPS will be dethroned as the world's number one shipping and logistics business by revenues.But don't just take my word for it. Check out the revenue growth of the two companies during the past decade.Source: YChartsFedEx has been quietly closing gap between the two companies. The chart below pretty much seals the deal with this comparison: FedEx consistently grows its revenues faster than UPS, yet, as we've seen the company trades at a discount. Unbelievable.Source: YChartsAdmittedly, a fortuitous event fell into the lap of FedEx in 2015, when they were granted permission to acquire TNT Express, which added $7.4 billion to total revenue, as is reflected in the above chart when revenue growth spikes around 2016-2017.However, even if we back out the addition of that $7.4 billion to their revenues, FedEx closed the revenue gap by 12.56% over the last 8 years. With the acquisition of TNT Express, the gap between the two has nearly disappeared.Final Verdict On Revenue Growth: FedEx Takes The VictoryAside from my comments regarding each companies' management of their cash flows, the numbers do not lie (they did for valuation) with respect to revenue growth. FedEx has grown its revenues faster than UPS, especially so with the acquisition of TNT, and with its enormous capex spend, it is further positioned to capitalize on the growing e-commerce trend.Especially in the last two years, UPS has had the far superior operating margins, as defined by operating income/revenue. As a result of FedEx's acquisition of TNT Express, FedEx has experienced margin compression, making UPS's margins much stronger by comparison.Source: YChartsUPS has been able to maintain such strong margins through consistent price increases in its Ground Segment while controlling expenses to a greater degree than has FedEx.Until proven otherwise, it seems UPS will be able command higher and higher prices on their Ground Segment, from which they derive a large portion of their profits in the U.S.Final Verdict On Valuation: UPS Wins The Margin Battle But BewareAlthough FedEx concedes defeat to UPS with respect to their margins, one must consider that Amazon is primarily targeting the core of UPS's business model through Amazon's own shipping offering.There's a certain dynamic in economics that unfolds when a market participant in a highly competitive industry commands high margins. New entrants arrive and begin to eat away at the profits the incumbent (UPS) has been generating. New entrants continue to appear and a price war ensues, as the new entrants lure away customers from the incumbent with lower prices. This continues until nobody is able to generate strong profits because the industry has too many competitors seeking a return. These business are called businesses with no moats.I'm fairly confident this will unfold until UPS loses the revenues it generates from Amazon (which are alleged to be around 10% of total UPS revenues). And if UPS can't adapt to the new price competition, Amazon may begin exporting its in-house delivery services just as it has done with AWS. This would not bode well for UPS or FedEx to be sure, but the most damaged company will certainly be UPS.As an aside (which actually may be central to the conversation around Amazon vs. UPS) there is an unfortunate phenomenon unfolding in the U.S. at present where workers are being stripped of their benefits, retirement plans, and competitive wages as corporations become wealthy and pay rock bottom prices for labor (Examples: Uber (UBER) or Amazon Flex). Ultimately, it's up to the citizens of a country to determine whether they stand for such treatment of workers by corporations, but companies such as Uber and Amazon, currently take advantage of their ""independent contractors"" through low wages and a lack of benefits.Presently, both UPS and FedEx struggle to generate positive free cash flow. This can be attributed to two factors:Source: YChartsAs the above chart illustrates, UPS has only recently began aggressively devoting dollars to capex. Conversely, FedEx has been aggressively spending on capex for over a decade.Source: YChartsFinal Verdict on Valuation: UPS's Cash Flows Trounce Those of FedExFor the sake of deciding a winner for this comparison, I will take the cash flow profiles at face value. As such, it's no question that UPS is the winner. From their higher operating margins to the gulf between their operating cash flows and capital expenditures, it's easy to see that UPS walks away with the win, at least for now.If you haven't been keeping track, the companies are tied at 2-2. The final section should persuade you as to which company is worth buying for decades to come. Furthermore, the next and final section explores the most important aspect of this comparison: How Different Managements Return Shareholder Capital.In response to the long held debate, I will provide an gleaming example of effective management, using capital in the most judicious way given the circumstances. In addition, I will illustrate an example of a management that has returned capital in a way, which on the surface seems positive, but is actually deleterious to its shareholders.The following two graphs could summarize the entirety of what anybody needs to know when approaching investment in either company in 2019. As some preliminary information, the major dips that occur in each company's cash from operations are the result of multi-billion dollar contributions to their pension funds, and as such, should be seen largely as irregularities. What is most crucial is the way in which management has used the free cash flow for creating shareholder value.Source: YChartsThe above chart illustrates the level of levered free cash flow UPS has produced over the last 10 years. As can be seen, UPS has reserved significant portions of its FCF for activities such as dividends and share repurchase programs, while suppressing its capex, which could've been used for expansionary projects, automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, or otherwise gaining a leg up on the fierce competition that surrounds them.Source: YChartsOver the last ten years, management has retired approximately 130 million shares, resulting in a 13% reduction in share count. Furthermore, in the same period, UPS has raised its dividend another 57%.Source: YChartsMeanwhile, the U.S. and the rest of the world have been experiencing one of the most expansionary periods for shipping in recent history, and e-commerce's growth does not appear to be abating.Source: StatistaIt's almost as if UPS management has been asleep at the wheel during one of the greatest periods of evolution for the shipping and logistics business the U.S. has ever seen.Well... at least they financially engineered their earnings upward and kept their shareholders temporarily happy. And at least the dividend has grown nicely over the years.Conversely, FedEx has been aggressively investing for the future through massive capex spend, the growth of which has been in lockstep with its operating cash flows.Source: YChartsIn FedEx's most recent annual report, they stated that 30% of their 2017 fiscal year's capex was devoted to ""growth initiatives"".As evidence of FedEx's commitment to returning shareholder capital through reinvestment, let's look at the growth rates of the two companies' total sales.Source: YChartsAs the graph illustrates, FedEx consistently outperforms UPS in quarter over quarter revenue growth, a testament to the strategy of FedEx's management.In response to one of the most expansive period for shipping and logistics America has seen since its birth, FedEx has devoted billions every year to automating its shipping hubs, investing in 3D printing technology, employing blockchain technology, and positioning itself well for the future of commerce; whereas, UPS has returned most of its cash flows to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.Final Verdict On Valuation: FedEx Wins For Its Focus on the FutureAlthough it cannot be officially determined that FedEx will prevail, it certainly appears at the moment that they are the more equipped team to navigate the rapidly evolving shipping and logistics landscape.In 10 years, investors will be able to look back on what has transpired between these two companies and use this case study for future investment decisions. Although it appears UPS has been asleep at the wheel, they have recently rapidly accelerated their capex spend and taken on more debt; both of which lead me to believe the company is finally realizing that the industry is rapidly evolving, and they cannot remain on cruise control as demand for logistics services increases and new market entrants appear.Is it too late for UPS? Only time will tell, but my greatest concern for UPS would be the threat of Amazon and the gig economy; both of which are notorious for low wages and disregard for workers' welfare. In contrast, UPS has been lauded for its high wages and regard for its unionized workers, a facet of its business that, unfortunately, may actually make it less competitive against the likes of Amazon and Uber.According to my analysis, FedEx will outperform UPS over the coming decade, especially with Fred Smith at the helm. Read on for some more information and my final comments!In 2013, UPS attempted to acquire TNT Express, a Dutch based logistics business but couldn't due to antitrust regulators in Europe.UPS dropped its $6.9 billion bid for TNT in 2013 after the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, blocked the deal, concerned that it would limit choice for European shipping customers and lead to price increases.Two years later, FedEx moved to acquire the Dutch company with its own bid. When FedEx made its offer of $4.8 billion, the value of the euro had declined more than 19% in value against the dollar, making the transaction especially appealing. The deal added $7.4 billion to FedEx's total revenues, further narrowing the gap between UPS' and FedEx's yearly sales.Despite the apparent bargain price FedEx paid, many have bemoaned the pace with which the company has executed the merger. Although the merger has not gone as smooth as management and investors would have hoped, the TNT Express acquisition seems likely to be valuable for FedEx in the future.The Amazon threat further strengthens my contention that FedEx is the vastly superior buy at this point. While UPS derives 10% of its revenues from Amazon, FedEx derives a mere 3%. From my perspective, it's inevitable that Amazon will eventually be self-sufficient in delivery of its online products, so long as they continue on their current trajectory.The next question would be then, ""Will Amazon export their delivery services to businesses outside of Amazon's ecosystem?""If Amazon's strategy is anything like their AWS or Prime strategy, then it is highly likely that Amazon will use its spare capacity to begin poaching business outside of its own ecosystem, and it's made it apparent that it is prepared to underpay its workers dramatically.Who stands to lose the most in the event Amazon executes this strategy years down the road?The company that generates an enormous portion of its high margin revenues through their U.S. delivery business, i.e. UPS. Furthermore, FedEx has insulated itself from the Amazon threat because its business is more globally oriented.Admittedly, FedEx did catch a break with their TNT acquisition as the EU competition commission prevented UPS from acquiring it; after which FedEx got it at a bargain price. That vaulted them even closer to surpassing UPS, and without the acquisition, UPS would still hold a commanding lead in total revenues.Maybe one day FedEx will turn on the cash flow spigot, but that will likely be the day Fred is no longer CEO, and the new management cares more about dividends and financial engineering than aggressive reinvestment and growth. For now, investors in FedEx must understand that share price appreciation will be the primary means of ROI for shareholders, as FedEx's current level of capex spend, a large percentage of which goes to growth initiatives, just doesn't allow for substantially higher dividends and more aggressive share repurchase programs.For those looking to buy, I've shared in previous articles that I believe the 160s to be a prime buying zone, and recently, I discovered that an insider noteworthily agrees.While each company has its merits, from my perspective, FedEx is the clear winner for investors with a multi-decade time horizon, looking to capitalize on the growth of e-commerce, logistics, and a globalizing economy (most of the time)."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »Dividend yield theory works under the assumption that dividend-paying stocks over time revert to their historical average dividend yield. They are presumably undervalued when their dividend yield is historically high and conversely overvalued when their dividend yield is historically low. Sounds simple, buy stocks when the dividend yield is high and sell when the dividend yield is low. More often than not, a simple strategy like this one works just as good if not better when compared to sophisticated complex algorithms. Its best advantage is that it is easy to follow and replicate. The aim of this article is to show you how I have adopted a version of the dividend yield theory to develop a screen for stock selection.The biggest problem I have come across with all my previous stock screeners was that I did not always like the stocks my screeners showed as the best opportunities. Sometimes I didn't like the company, the industry, or simply didn't know enough about the stock to confidently make a purchase. The fact that I let my emotions dictate my decisions was a huge handicap when the time came to pull the trigger. To compensate, I would tighten the parameters of the screeners to eliminate the undesirable companies, which, in hindsight, just sounds ridiculous and also brought on a whole new set of fears that I was going to eliminate great companies along with the undesirable ones. This was the biggest hurdle I had to overcome when developing my dividend yield theory screener. The best method to overcome this dilemma was to simply start with a universe of stocks that I already knew and liked. Sure there may be great opportunities out there I may miss by limiting myself to 40 or 50 companies, but I figured I would rather miss an opportunity than invest in a company I don't like or understand. The long-term plan is to keep expanding this universe with new companies after they are carefully reviewed and fit into my overall investing strategy.This screener will identify the most undervalued companies that will be further evaluated to ensure their fundamentals and future prospects are favorable. I will be using this strategy to initiate or add to existing positions in my portfolio on a monthly basis. However, for an investor who is just starting out, here is a hypothetical strategy to build a long-term portfolio using this screener. Each month initiate a new position in the most undervalued stock, working your way down the list until you have at least 10-20 unique positions. 10 unique positions are probably the minimum you want to have to add diversification to your portfolio. To add further diversification, you should also own stocks across multiple different sectors and set a maximum weight per position. Diversification is extremely difficult to accomplish especially early on in the development of a portfolio; however, over time, you will be able to grow the portfolio to at least 20-30 unique positions adding at opportunistic prices. The biggest advantage to this strategy is initiating or adding to existing positions at favorable market prices which over time should increase portfolio returns when stock prices return to normal price levels. A potential weakness may be the lack of undervalued stocks during certain months in which case an investor can either temporarily sit on their cash or invest in the highest ranked fairly valued stock. Additionally, like all other valuation methods, this measure of value is not an exact science and therefore, requires an investor to do their due diligence on the future prospects of each company prior to initiating a position.The starting place for this screener, like many of my prior screeners, was the CCC list developed by the late David Fish. From the All CCC tab, I filtered for companies with a payout ratio smaller than 60% and the following DGR percentages: at least 7% growth for the last 3- and 5-year periods. I then sorted the file by the number of years of growth (descending order) and started looking at each company from the top. If I already knew the company and liked, it was added to the list; if I didn't know the company, I would do a quick search on Seeking Alpha and read some of the latest articles to help make the decision whether the company should be included or not. The main focus was to include companies whose business I can understand and/or I believe will be profitable for years to come. Obviously, this is a very biased judgment call on my part and therefore, each company should be further evaluated before an actual position is initiated. After I had 52 companies selected, it was time to compute their historical dividend yields. Manually computing historical dividend yields was going to be time consuming, so 52 stocks were plenty to start. One additional test was added prior to actually computing historical dividend yields. I wanted to ensure each of the selected stocks had a dividend growth rate for a 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year period of at least 7% if applicable. Stocks that did not have a 15- or 10-year dividend history were not penalized, but all stocks in my universe will be removed if any of their above-mentioned dividend growth rates fall below 7%. Here is a list of all 52 companies with their 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year dividend growth rates in the order I reviewed them.I decided to choose the last 10 years as the time period for calculating historical yields. I extracted monthly historical price data from Yahoo Finance for a 10-year period for each stock. Next, I pulled the historical dividends paid and adjusted for any stock splits. Then, I combined the two files assigning the corresponding forward dividend to each monthly close price. I computed the dividend yield for each of the last 120 months by dividing the forward dividend by the close price. To compute the average historical dividend yield, I simply found the average of all the dividend yields for all 120 months. I computed this for each of the stocks in my universe and created a summary.By comparing the current dividend yield to the historical dividend yield, I was able to identify which stocks may be undervalued and potentially by how much. Of course, there are many factors that may cause a stock to currently have a historically high dividend yield and therefore, this method should only be used to identify stocks for further review. It is not recommended to make investment decision based on this metric alone. Each month, I update the historical dividend yields and start reviewing the most potentially undervalued stocks. Here is the summary for February 2019 (prices are as of close 2/8/19).Potential reasons why a stock may currently have a historically high dividend yield are: negative news/performance that has caused the stock price to drop or the company has grown their dividend rapidly and their stock price has not kept up. Both of these scenarios would present great opportunities for purchase if we can favorably validate the long-term prospects of the business. Of course, there may be numerous other factors that have caused the dividend yield to exceed historical averages and therefore, each stock must be evaluated further to ensure we don't end up investing in a sinking ship. A great way to start the evaluation process is by researching the stock here on Seeking Alpha or by reviewing the company's latest earnings and annual reports.Another great tool I have added to my screener is a graph of a company's historical dividend yield. By looking at a graph of the dividend yield compared to the historical average, we can see how long the dividend yield has been under/overvalued. Below is the graph for FedEx Corp., the number one undervalued stock on February's list. The two additional green lines in the graph are the one and two standard deviation measures of the historical dividend yield.Source: Self-prepared using data from Yahoo FinanceAs you can see from the graph, the dividend yield for FedEx has grown rapidly from mid-2016 and is currently at the highest level in the last 10 years. This can be explained by two reasons. First, FedEx has ramped up their dividend growth in the last five years. In the table below, you can see that starting in 2014 FedEx started increasing their dividend by at least 20% each year. A clearer picture is painted by looking at the running 5-year annualized dividend growth rate which has grown from 8.29% in 2014 to 26.86% in 2018. The second explanation for the currently high dividend yield is their recent price drop. The price peaked in early 2018 at around $260 but has pulled back to a recent low around $160 during December of 2018. There is also the possibility that due to their recent high dividend growth, FedEx is plateauing at a new normal dividend yield and will not return to their historical average.Upon further analysis of FedEx, we can see in the chart below, they have grown their revenue at a CAGR of 8.37% over the last 4 years while also growing operating income at a CAGR of 25.11% during that same period. The number of shares outstanding has remained relatively stable; therefore, we can safely assume they are not trying to display growth through buybacks.In the table below, we can see earnings per share have grown at a CAGR of 46.45% over the last 4 years. This is quite fast especially for a large company and definitely not sustainable over a longer term. A quick review of their recent financials shows that FedEx has been spending approximately $4 billion to $5 billion annually over the last 4 years on capital expenditures mainly funded by issuance of new debt. This can explain the recent uptick in earnings growth and there is nothing wrong with growth through debt. However, investors should keep a close eye on debt levels in the future. Also, in the table below, we can see that the payout ratio for FedEx has been getting smaller and therefore, provides sufficient room for future dividend growth.A quick review of margin rates for FedEx shows they have maintained a steady gross margin around 22% over the last 4 years. Their operating margin has grown from 4.52% to slightly over 8% which points to improvements in their operations. The net margin has also seen improvement; however, part of the 2018 net margin increase is most likely attributed to recent tax code changes.Here are the graphs for the remaining top 5 stocks in my screener.International Business MachineSource: Self-prepared using data from Yahoo FinanceBank OZKSource: Self-prepared using data from Yahoo FinancePrudential Financial Inc.Source: Self-prepared using data from Yahoo FinancePrincipal Financial Group Inc.Source: Self-prepared using data from Yahoo FinanceTo summarize, dividend yield theory can be a useful tool in developing a stock screener that can identify when companies are potentially undervalued. I have tailored it to work for me by limiting my starting universe and self-computing the historical dividend yields to control the time period I prefer. Investors can use this simple strategy and screener to identify undervalued stocks that can be added to their portfolios. Investing in undervalued stocks increases the likelihood of increasing overall returns when stock prices return to their fair market values. For February 2019, FedEx was identified as potentially the most undervalued stock with a dividend yield exceeding 2 standard deviations above their 10-year trailing dividend yield. After a brief review of their financials, we have determined that FedEx has pumped large amounts of cash, funded by new debt, into capital expenditures that helped them speed up growth of their operating income and bottom line earnings. Based on their recent growth and a low payout ratio, I expect their amazing dividend growth to continue into the future and their stock price to return to full valuation rewarding long-term investors."

But FedEx remains an industry leader with growth potential.FedEx is significantly undervalued and is a bargain dividend growth stock for 2019.","Written by Bob Ciura for Sure DividendThere is arguably no company more eager to see 2018 come to a close than shipping giant FedEx Corp. (FDX). It has simply been a terrible year for the stock. Shares of FedEx, currently at $158 per share, are off 43% from the 52-week high, and are now down 37% for the year.Most of the decline has to do with fears of slowing global economic growth, as well as trade worries. Sentiment was dealt another blow when FedEx cut its earnings guidance for the fiscal year. However, the company still expects growth overall, as it continues to benefit from the e-commerce boom.Rather than succumb to the panic, investors should view FedEx’s drop in share price this year as a buying opportunity. FedEx shares offer both value and growth, a rare combination. Not only is the stock cheap on a valuation basis, FedEx is on the list of Dividend Achievers having raised its dividend each year for over 10 years in a row. FedEx stock is one of the S&P’s biggest bargains for 2019.FedEx Corp. is a transportation and shipping company. It is one of the two industry giants in the U.S., along with close competitor UPS. FedEx was founded in 1971, and today has a market capitalization of $64.7 billion. The company offers a variety of services including transportation, e-commerce, and business services. It operates five core segments: FedEx Express, TNT Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. FedEx provides domestic and international shipping for package delivery, freight, both air and ground. It also provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services.One of the most attractive aspects of the business, from an investor’s perspective, is that the company has a tight grip atop an industry that essentially acts as a duopoly. It is virtually impossible for a smaller competitor to build a transport network large enough to take market share from FedEx. In fact, FedEx Ground has increased its market share for 19 years in a row. Therefore, even Amazon as a serious competitor seems far-fetched, given FedEx’s massive scale.Source: Roadshow PresentationOn December 19th FedEx reported financial results for its fiscal 2019 second quarter. Revenue of $17.8 billion rose 9.2% from the same quarter last year, and beat analyst expectations by $50 million. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $4.03 beat expectations by $0.09 per share, and increased 27% year-over-year. Despite the strong performance last quarter, FedEx shares declined 10% the morning of the earnings release due to the company’s significant guidance cut for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, FedEx now expects adjusted earnings-per-share of $15.50 to $16.60, versus prior guidance of $17.20 to $17.80. The company blamed slowing economic growth in various parts of the world, as well as the impact of escalating trade tensions.In our view, too much attention is being paid to FedEx reducing earnings guidance for fiscal 2019. Yes, it was a sizable reduction. But the company should still have plenty of opportunities for future growth, at the current valuation the market seems to be ignoring FedEx’s growth potential. FedEx has increased earnings-per-share at a very high rate in the years since the Great Recession. As a global transportation company, FedEx is an economic “bellwether”, a term used to describe a company that benefits from global economic growth (and vice versa).FedEx’s high earnings growth is due to the e-commerce boom. Consumers are doing a much higher portion of their shopping online, which requires shipping services.Source: Roadshow PresentationIn addition to rising shipping volumes, FedEx has a unique ability to raise prices. Pricing power is an advantage of investing in industry-leading companies. Since FedEx’s services are necessary for so many consumers and businesses, it can pass along regular price increases to drive revenue growth, without sacrificing volumes. Effective January 2019, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground will be increasing shipping rates by an average of 4.9%, while FedEx Freight will be increasing rates an average of 5.9%.FedEx’s reduced earnings guidance is a possible signal of a global economic slowdown, but over the long term we still expect 8% annualized earnings growth, which may be overly conservative given the company’s excellent track record. Despite the steep reduction in fiscal 2019 guidance, the company still expects adjusted earnings growth of 4.8% at the midpoint of guidance. The market is clearly disappointed with FedEx’s performance this year, but at the current valuation, FedEx is being priced like a no-growth company or worse.After the huge sell-off in FedEx shares, the stock has a very low valuation. FedEx stock trades for a relatively modest valuation, particularly since the company has a long history of generating high earnings growth. Based on fiscal 2019 expected earnings of $16.05 per share at the midpoint of guidance, FedEx stock currently trades for a price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.7; this is well below the 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.7.It could be reasonably argued that FedEx stock should not trade at the 10-year average, since this period included the economic recovery after the Great Recession. An environment of slowing global growth in the years ahead would likely result in a lower average valuation for FedEx stock. Still, we view a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 as entirely reasonable for a highly profitable, industry-leading company with positive growth expectations. Even a modest valuation of 14 times EPS would yield significant returns. If it takes five years to reach the fair value price-to-earnings ratio of 14, the corresponding multiple expansion could boost annual returns by 7.6%.Of course, earnings growth and dividends will also contribute to shareholder returns. As mentioned previously, we expect 8% annual earnings growth over the next five years. In addition, FedEx has a 1.6% dividend yield. While this is a below-average yield in the context of the broader S&P 500 Index, which yields 2% right now, FedEx’s dividend yield is at a 10+ year high.FDX Dividend Yield (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsFedEx is not a high-yielder, but instead it is a high dividend growth stock. It increased its dividend by 30% in 2018. Even with a near-term global economic slowdown, FedEx should at least achieve 10% annual dividend growth over full economic cycles. Based on the current dividend payout of $2.60 per share, FedEx is projected to have a dividend payout ratio of 16.2% for fiscal 2019. This is a very low payout ratio that leaves plenty of room for strong dividend increases.Therefore, the combination of 8% earnings growth, a 7.6% tailwind from valuation expansion, and the 1.6% current dividend yield add up to total expected returns of over 17% per year.During market downturns, even high-quality stocks are not immune. FedEx has been swept up in the broader fears of slowing global economic growth, tariffs, and trade tensions. It is true that 2018 is likely to be a weaker year than FedEx and its investors are used to, but it seems that the sell-off is overdone. When the market is gripped by fear, investors tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. FedEx is a highly profitable company, with a positive growth outlook. The valuation has compressed so much that FedEx stock appears to be a bargain heading into 2019."

We think the price declines made it a promising investment opportunity for the next 12-24 months.FedEx has around 5,000 operating facilities that link over 99% of the world's gross domestic product. It sorts over 15 million shipments per day. The company is priced like it is a low-growth stock with a forward P/E ratio of around 10x or 11x (if you believe management’s guidance), yet management has respectable long-term goals of increasing earnings per share 10-15% per annum. The company has had some below-plan performance in the past, and management has cut costs to correct that.Insider Monkey’s monthly activist newsletter focuses on stocks that are pitched by hedge funds in their investor letters, at hedge fund conferences and TV appearances, or through 13D filings. We evaluate the attractiveness of these stock picks and make recommendations based on our analysis. Our stock picks in our activist strategy returned 61% since its inception 2 years ago vs. the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY)’s gain of 21%.For the quarter ended December 2018, Mason Hawkins's Southeastern Asset Management increased its position by 4% to 2.64 million shares, good for 6.08% of its equity portfolio. “FedEx shares, a duopoly with UPS in the U.S. ground business, yet trades at a 13.9x price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), while UPS is at 18.0x. FedEx has lower labor costs and more growth potential as it takes share from UPS and integrates its recent purchase of TNT. FedEx has a dividend yield of less than 1% and a 1.2 beta, while UPS has a 2.9% dividend yield and a beta of 0.7,” said the fund’s September 2016 investor letter about the stock. The value fund believes FedEx’s margins are nowhere near peak and the company can “raise margins even without an economic or revenue tailwind.”More recently Lakewood Capital, which doubled its FedEx position in Q4 and allocated 5% of its 13F portfolio to the stock, said the following about the stock in its 2018 annual letter:Artisan Partners was also buying FedEx shares recently. Here is what they said about the stock:FedEx used to be a great way to play the rise of ecommerce, which many expect to grow around double-digit percentage rates through 2025. The more people bought stuff online, the more things were shipped, with FedEx benefiting. The company’s revenues rose a lot because of it.Lately, there has been concern that FedEx could be cannibalized by Amazon (AMZN). The rumor that Amazon might have left the delivery company XPO Logistics (XPO) also added to the speculation. Amazon was rumored to be XPO's largest customer previously, and XPO shares fell sharply after the company slashed its 2019 guidance. Overall, FedEx is down 26% in the last four quarters.Amazon seems to be entering the delivery parcel business. According to the Wall Street Journal in February 2018, the company is ""preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses,"" dubbing it ""Shipping with Amazon."" Amazon plans to start the service in Los Angeles and aims to bring it to other cities. It's initially going to be done with Amazon's third-party sellers, but it could eventually be offered to other businesses. The original plan was to offer delivery services cheaper than FedEx and UPS. Competition from Amazon is bad news, as it drives down margins.Amazon is a strong competitor. The company used to be a bookseller. Due to Bezos’ determination, it became so much more. The former bookseller now sells everything, ranging from soda to televisions. Given how important speedy delivery is in the age of instant gratification, it would be logical for Amazon to want to ""in-house"" the delivery of parcels.Amazon could save money if it did logistics on its own. It spent around $27.7 billion shipping globally in 2018 and $21.7 billion in shipping globally in 2017. According to some estimates, the company could save around $1-2 billion for 2019 if it had more control over its shipments.For its in-house transportation fleet, Amazon has around 40 cargo planes (FedEx has around 675 aircraft), but plans on expanding that number to 50 over the next few years. Morgan Stanley believes that Amazon will eventually have around 100 planes at some point. The company has also recently established a position in the future of transportation with investments in self-driving tech (Aurora) and an electric truck start-up (Rivian).Although FedEx has many competitive advantages, there is cause for concern. Amazon has deeper pockets than FedEx. Amazon has arguably greater tech mastery. The company has built-in demand for its transportation needs due to its customer base. It arguably can anticipate transportation demand better too, due to detailed purchasing history data.Another reason why FedEx shares are down is due to international weakness. Due to the European economy undergoing some soft spots, FedEx’s earnings and guidance hasn’t met some bullish estimates.Some investors think Amazon might buy FedEx. The company has shown that it is willing to buy to get into a sector. It bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion to get into the physical store business.To get into the delivery transportation business, Amazon would really have two big options, as FedEx is one of two main parcel carriers globally, with the other being UPS.At around $50 billion in market cap and around $62 billion in enterprise value, FedEx is small enough for a company Amazon’s size to swallow and integrate without too many issues. At last count, Amazon had a market cap of around $800 billion. The other carrier, UPS, might be a little too big for Amazon given its market capitalization of almost $100 billion and enterprise value of around $113 billion.It might also make financial sense for Amazon. Lakewood Capital Management estimates that FedEx is trading around ""replacement cost for its network"" at around current prices. So, for Amazon to do what FedEx is doing currently, it would have to spend around $62 billion. Given the importance of getting fast delivery and optimization to keep market share versus the likes of Walmart (WMT), a payment premium of $20-25 billion could be worth it for Amazon.Amazon doesn't control much of the ""last mile"" delivery sector, which is important if the e-commerce company wants to make shipments faster and faster. FedEx is one of the big ""last mile"" delivery players, along with UPS.Many believe the next big thing in e-commerce is same-day delivery or one-hour delivery. Offering same-day or one-hour delivery economically will depend on optimizing last mile costs and delivery time. So far, this service is very expensive, but the rewards of solving the problem economically would give the winner big rewards.If Amazon buys FedEx, the latter's shareholders might make more money than before due to the premium commanded. FedEx currently has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 10x-11x. Given that FedEx has a historical multiple of around 15x, Amazon paying a forward multiple of around 14x-15x to buy FedEx seems plausible.It is important to note that Amazon wasn't even FedEx's biggest customer in 2018, and the company accounted for under 1.3% of FedEx's sales for the year.In terms of the effect of future competition, Morgan Stanley believes UPS and FedEx sales would be 2% higher if Amazon didn't do Amazon Air around this year. By 2025, that number could potentially amount to around 10%. There could be enough growth in e-commerce, which is expected by many to grow around double-digit percentage rates through 2025 that FedEx continues to benefit even if Amazon in-houses its own needs and competes.The other headwind, international weakness, is arguably not that much of a concern given FedEx’s rather low forward valuation of 10x-11x. According to Bloomberg, “Trump is eager for a China trade agreement so as to spark a further equity rally”. FedEx lowered its adjusted earnings outlook for 2019 to $15.50-16.60 from the previous $17.20-17.80 due to some international weakness, among other things. We believe the trade disputes will be resolved sooner rather than later and the company will deliver a positive earnings surprise for 2019.Lakewood Capital notes that FedEx ""has been punished"" due to concerns surrounding the global economy. The delivery of goods is a cyclical business. Although there is some weakness in the international segment, the fund notes that around two-thirds of FedEx's sales are generated in the United States, where the economy is strong.FedEx is cutting costs such as limiting hiring and reducing discretionary spending. The company continues to integrate its TNT acquisition, which handled around 1 million packages shipped daily.There are some risks to the FedEx story. One risk is that the international economy continues to soften and FedEx earnings dive. Another is the U.S. economy weakening. Yet another risk is Amazon building a better logistical network over time and driving down margins for FedEx and UPS. FedEx management could also not execute very well. If Amazon buys another transportation giant, FedEx could lose a lot down the road.The Amazon story is one to watch. Amazon has caused many retail stocks to underperform. It could potentially cause parcel delivery stocks to underperform too.In June 2015, FedEx management projected “adjusted earnings to be $10.60 to $11.10 per diluted share before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments” for 2016. Shares traded at $170 at the time. Today, the company’s projections for 2019 are 50% higher, yet FedEx shares trade for $174.We believe concerns about global economic softness and competition from Amazon depressed FedEx shares to temporarily low levels. FedEx will significantly outperform the S&P 500 Index over the next 12-24 months as the company beats its earnings guidance and completes the integration of TNT Express, which will boost FedEx’s earnings. We believe FedEx will continue to grow its earnings per share by double digits annually and deserves a P/E multiple of at least as high as the S&P 500 Index, which is expected to grow its earnings by 7% next year and has a multiple of 16.We recommend a position in FedEx shares."
4234145,24018,2019-01-17T17:39:53-05:00,"FedEx is a premier organization.The stock's been pounded on a spate of bad news. Management didn't gloss it over.  They reset expectations.If one believes management has the wherewithal to fix the problems, the stock is trading at a significant discount.The late-December stock market swoon just sharpened up the deal.","After a bit of a holiday hiatus, I'm back in the saddle. Year-end 2018 was a tough investment climate, but the rolling bear uncovered several gems. Amidst the rubble was large-cap, blue-chip growth stock FedEx Corp (FDX). Peak to trough, the stock fell over 40% in the space of three months.FedEx meets my basic screening criteria for picking winning stocks: the underlying company is well-managed, owns a strong franchise, has a sound balance sheet, earns its profits in cash, and it's shareholder-friendly. The stock appears to trade below Fair Value.Beyond that, the company and the stock have been pounded down due to a confluence of negative events: a significant earnings guide-down, plus concerns about free cash flow generation, margin compression, slower-than-anticipated TNT acquisition integration, and the ""death star,"" aka Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The news spurred a bevy of analyst downgrades.All of which I view as a positive.When a premier company takes a big hit on a spate of bad news, and the stock price goes into full-on bear mode, it's time to take a look under the hood and see whether Mr. Market got a little too depressed.I believe FedEx remains a solid enterprise. My 18-month target price is ~$245. If accurate, that's a 40% uplift from a recent $170 bid, excluding dividends.Immediately, I see FedEx owning an advantage: it's an oligopoly. Good investors love oligopolies. Competitors are limited. Actually, rival United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is a loose competitor; the two companies' business models aren't true overlays.Duplicating FedEx's international transportation and logistics network is nearly impossible. It's a wide-moat business.The operation rides the coattails of the global economy. Therefore, this industrial corporation exhibits a level of cyclical behavior. The cyclicality is mitigated by the demand for increasing international business connectivity, and the rise of e-commerce, both of which are somewhat secular trends.Indeed, the daily volume of FedEx Express and FedEx Ground packages handled continues to escalate.Source: FedEx FY 2018 10-KA YoY 3.6% increase in 2017-2018 has been followed by another 5.5% advance through the first half of the current 2019 fiscal year (fiscal year ends May 31).FinancialsFedEx has a sound balance sheet. Yes, long-term debt is rising, increasing some 20% since FY 2016. However, over the same period, shareholder equity jumped over 40%. Goodwill represented only 13% of FedEx's total assets. Meanwhile, the company easily covers its interest payments. Through the first half of fiscal 2019, the Interest Coverage ratio (net interest expense/EBIT) is above 9x.Liquidity is strong. The current ratio is 1.41x. There's $7.91 cash on the balance sheet (about $2.1 billion), representing 5% of the share price. In addition, FedEx placed a $2 billion revolver through 2020. As disclosed in the 10-Q, the most significant bank covenant associated with the credit facility is a 3.5x net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio. As of November 30, the firm's ratio is 2.1x.The debt-to-equity ratio is 85%. This places the company in the middle of the range when compared with all Air Freight and Logistics corporations. Notably, the ratio has been trending down. At the end of fiscal year 2016, the debt-to-equity ratio was 100%. This reflects positively upon management's ability to build shareholder equity faster than increase corporate debt.Currently, FedEx enjoys a 26% return on equity. I consider a 15% return to be the benchmark hurdle for well-run industrial corporations.Turning to cash flow, FedEx generates cash flow in excess of profits consistently. This is a hallmark of businesses whereas I look to become a shareholder. A F.A.S.T. graph illustrates this clearly.Nonetheless, we see operating cash flow peaked in 2016 and has declined thereafter. Later in this article, we'll cover the cash flow/free cash flow issue in more detail.Adjusted EPS: A Degree of Separation With ManagementI question how management reports ""adjusted,"" or operating earnings. Generally, I concur with their view on the various put-and-takes. However, I do not agree with citing TNT Express integration and amortization expenses ""below the line."" The acquisition is now some three years down the road, and the full benefits thereof are not expected to become apparent until FY 2020.The following table illustrates as-reported GAAP EPS, management's operating EPS, and ""Ray's"" operating EPS. The period covered includes FY 2016 through forecast FY 2019:FedEx Corporation EPS - FY 2016 through FY 2019Data compiled via company investor website and author's computationsIncluding TNT Express integration expenses, I project FedEx FY 2019 operating EPS should increase 5.3% versus last year. The EPS growth differential isn't material versus the company's view. The delta EPS is a more salient factor when reviewing FedEx's operating margins. That comparison is upcoming.SummaryOn balance, FedEx looks to be healthy. Debt is manageable. Liquidity is good. Operating cash flows run higher than profits. Return on equity and shareholders' equity build is solid. Underpinning operations is increasing package volume, coupled with the businesses' ability to raise pricing (indicative of a strong franchise). Effective January 1, 2019, FedEx raised rates by approximately 5%.Source: FedEx January investor presentationOh, yeah... the warts.Yes, part of the investment thesis revolved around the fact there's been a bevy of bad news surrounding the company. In conjunction, the stock price was decimated in a short period of time. On the other hand, since the bad news is out, one could take the view the path forward is up... presuming management ""gets it"" and has the ability to right the ship. This is what good management teams do.So, let's take a look at what's bugging the Street.A Big Downside Guidance CutDuring the December 18, 2018, fiscal year 2Q earnings release, management reduced FY 2019 guidance significantly. The Street freaked out. Unquestionably, the magnitude of the guide-down was surprising; this precipitated the hand-wringing. Midpoint operating EPS guidance of $17.50 was knocked back to $16.05, an 8.2% hit. Coupled with a market-wide late-December downdraft, the results were predictable: FDX stock got crushed.Stepping back a bit, it was notable the reasons behind the guide-down were primarily macro-related. Weakness in the European market was fingered, and this had the knock-on effect of slowing the TNT Express acquisition synergies.Free Cash Flow WorriesOver the years, there's been an ebb and flow to FedEx's operating cash flow. More recently, after peaking in 2016, the trend's been lower. The issue has been compounded by ambitious capex spending; purchasing new aircraft, building out logistics infrastructure, technology, etc. The result is negative free cash flow. This means the company must borrow money to fund the business and pay the dividend.Using another F.A.S.T. graph, here's a long-term picture illustrating FedEx's operating cash flow versus capital expenditures.Indeed, we see in 2017 and 2018 the purple bars are taller than the blue bars. It's not expected to get better in FY 2019. You may also note the ""sine-wave"" operating cash flows. Over the past 15 years, two such instances are evidenced. We're into the third wave now.TNT Express/FedEx Express Operating Income DeferralThis quote is directly from the most recent earnings release:Ouch. Well, that went over like a lead balloon. ""Accelerating"" EU weakness is bad enough. The 2017 cyberattack on TNT compounded matters.For reference, the FY 2017 adjusted operating income FedEx Corp benchmark was $5.48 billion. FY 2018 showed $5.73 billion operating income. This year will require management to pull out the stops to beat last year's results. The entire $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion FedEx Express operating income uplift is officially postponed.Margin CompressionPart-and-parcel (no pun intended) with the aforementioned come squeezed margins. The Street hates margin compression. Investors don't like it much, either.Here's the scorecard:FedEx Corporation Operating Margins - FY 2017 through 2019""Ray's"" adjusted operating margins include TNT Express integration expenses. Management excludes these expenses in the margin calculation.So, under any and all scenarios, margins are going down. This flies in the face of management's expectations: initially, FY 2019 operating margins were guided to 7.9% (GAAP) and 8.5% (adjusted). That seems unlikely now.The long-term objective is to goose margins up to 10%.The Death Star: AmazonI'll be short and to the point. I do not believe Amazon represents a significant threat to FedEx. Good people may disagree. First, Amazon represents a small percentage of FedEx's business; currently less than 3%. Management considers Amazon a good customer, not a competitor. Second, I contend FedEx has such a wide moat around its business, even Amazon would have a difficult time piercing it. Third, Amazon is unlikely to compete with FedEx other than through FedEx Ground. UPS would have more to worry about. Fourth, international carrier DHL is making another foray into the U.S. Market. This comes after a failed attempt about a decade ago. After spending billions of dollars trying to gain a toehold, DHL exited our domestic market in 2008. I doubt Amazon will elect to enter the ground delivery market concurrently when DHL (whereby such business is core) is attempting to do the same thing. Delivering packages isn't core to Amazon.I just don't buy this bear-case argument.In any event, there's plenty of other things not-to-like about FedEx now.Well, these saying are not exactly old, since I made them up myself.The first was based upon my reaction upon witnessing some college buds after some late-night drinking escapades:The second is a bit more business-appropriate:Since the first quote is largely self-explanatory, I'll elaborate upon the second.Well-run businesses, when faced with challenges, tend to seek changes to alter the trajectory of the problems, if not resolve the problems altogether. Good management teams listen, think, and respond. Since I believe FedEx Corp. is guided by good management, I contend the management team will do what's necessary to fix the problems.Buttressing this view was a management quote to several Street analysts shortly thereafter the guidedown. President & COO Dave Bronczek, CFO Alan Graf, and Express President & CEO Raj Subramaniam said,It's up to each investor to determine whether the FedEx management team can deliver. Certainly, management didn't mince words: I didn't notice waffling or back-door escape hatches. The words are plain-spoken.Furthermore, management followed up with a roadshow; within it, there were a couple of slides worth noting. This first reinforced what the team plans to do to address the current earnings/cash flow/margin shortfall: Source: FedEx January investor presentationI am onboard with these plans since it encompasses things management has the power to do. They have control over these items, even if some of the decisions will be difficult.The second slide is a reiteration of the longer-term goals and objectives of the corporation as it relates to its shareholders: Source: FedEx January investor presentationI found this significant since no one forced management to reiterate it. Instead of going radio silent, playing it safe, or offering contingencies, senior management simply re-stated the same broad goals it's espoused (and provided results upon) for years. I liked that.Therefore, for existing or future FedEx investors: I see a continued investment in FDX as largely a decision as to whether management is up to the tasks at hand. The issues are clear. Management says they ""get it."" Good companies adjust and adapt to re-position for continued success. My view is there are no fundamental flaws in the business model, or the businesses' ability to execute. There is no sea tide change in the air freight and logistics business.In this last section, we'll review stock valuation. Investors must decide if the current price is discounted enough to 1) reflect the bad news, and 2) offer sufficient upside in the event senior leadership makes good on its promises.A picture tells a thousand words. Therefore, I'll utilize FAST graphs to illustrate FedEx's long-term relationships with price and earnings, and price and operating cash flow.First, here's an FDX 15-year F.A.S.T. graph reflecting price and operating earnings:We immediately notice the steep drop in price versus the long-term P/E trendline. The drop is striking. Observing a bit more, we see the trimmed-average (normal) P/E is 17.0x, and the long-term operating EPS growth rate is 8.1%. Does the go-forward EPS forecast continue to support a 17x multiple? The next F.A.S.T. graphs chart helps us sort this out.If we look at the green box on the right-hand side of the chart, we find the forward EPS growth rate is expected to be 8.8%. Furthermore, this includes the current fiscal-year EPS growth rate forecast: just 4.5%. Currently, the Street expects FedEx to bounce back in fiscal 2020, which is aligned with management's promise to bringing home incremental operating income associated with the TNT Express deal. Indeed, the forward EPS growth rate exceeds the previous 15-year average.Let's look at another valuation metric.Here's another F.A.S.T. graph highlighting price and operating cash flow.Reviewing the current normalized P/OCF multiple and past cash flows paint a somewhat different picture. It suggests the recent drop in FDX price per share didn't reflect a deep discount, but rather a ""falling back to earth"" whereby the stock had been overvalued. It's now ""come in"" and offers a more suitable entry point for new investor or existing ones seeking to accumulate on the weakness. Looking out a couple years, we also notice operating cash flow is expected to increase sharply.Presuming management makes good on its promises to reign in capex; thereby leading to positive free cash flow, the combination of advancing operating cash flow and positive free cash flow could be a very good development.My inclination is to put more emphasis upon P/cash flow valuation versus P/earnings. This is partly due to the Street (and management's) understanding that the company needs to not only generate operating cash but enable a net cash surplus in the form of free cash flow. In other words, the investor focus is on cash more than earnings.Applying the long-term, 8.5x normalized cash flow multiple, one can defend a one-year price target between $199 and $253 a share. Over the past 5 years, the average P/CF multiple was 10.1x. If we are in a late-phase economic recovery, an 8.5x P/CF ratio/reversion to the mean makes sense.The price target presumes FedEx makes the current FY 2019 and FY 2020 cash flow per share numbers. Management has a good record when setting and meeting financial expectations. The recent guide-down exhibited the process. Management took the hits on a big guidance walk-back, reset expectations, and set themselves up to meet or beat.Risks to this thesis include domestic and/or EU-based economic recession.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment decision.

4229634,104228,2018-12-21T10:38:36-05:00,"Shares of FedEx dropped by 12% following the release of fiscal Q2 2019 results.European weakness and slowing global trade may weigh on earnings, while cost reductions are intended to mitigate the effects.While FedEx has a strong competitive advantages it is at best moderately attractive at current prices and looks quite fairly valued.Investors should cautiously expect to get normal free cash flow of around $8/share (5% yield), with potential for further growth over time.","FedEx (NYSE: FDX) reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 (quarter ended November 30, 2018). The results were viewed unfavorably by the market as the Company lowered the earnings outlook due to European weakness and slowing global trade.FDX data by YChartsThis caused the share price to drop in after-hours trading by approximately 6% from $185/share to $174/share and the following day by further 6% to roughly $162.5/share. The relatively sharp drop in price and surrounding news coverage brought the stock on to our radar.So, we gave it a quick look and safe to say, FedEx looks quite fairly valued.FedEx is definitely a wide-moat company due to its strong and long-standing position in the transportation market (since 1971) along with the widely recognized brand. Therefore, we think it is reasonable to look at recent years' earnings (in terms of free cash flow) as an indication of normal earnings power and expected future results.(Source: Morningstar, FedEx's fiscal year ends in May each year. *Free cash flow per share calculated using the respective year's outstanding shares. As of December 14, 2018 FedEx had a total of 261,043,625 shares outstanding.)However, when viewing the numbers for FedEx we quickly see that it doesn't make much sense to look many years back to get an idea of the firm's earning power. Since 2009 the Company has grown significantly in terms of sales - nearly doubling revenue to approximately $65.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Therefore, looking at average free cash flow for the last 10 years, and even maybe the last 3-5 years, would underestimate the true earning power.The free cash flow numbers per se also underestimate earning power because the growth in sales has not been reflected in equally rising operating cash flow. This is due in large part to accompanying growth in receivables and changes in pension and postretirement healthcare assets and liabilities. That is, to grow sales FedEx has made steady investments in working capital with rising receivables while making unusual voluntary contributions to its pension plan - both serving as a drag on operating cash flow, but not representative of a normal, no-growth scenario.Note: Operating cash flow in 2017 and 2018 was negatively impacted by additional pension contributions ($2.345 billion in 2018, $1.688 billion in 2017) that the Company does not expect to be as significant going forward:In other words, the growth in sales has suppressed operating and free cash flow. To estimate ""normal"" free cash flow for FedEx we should therefore make adjustments for the changes in working capital. It also seems more logical to emphasize more recent years as an indication of normal earning power - perhaps the average free cash flow for the last two or three years, or even just the last year's numbers (if we want to be more aggressive). Lastly, we are also generally skeptical about any growth assumptions and therefore assume no growth.Under normal, no-growth circumstances the Company would not need to invest in more working capital, e.g. with constant sales the receivables remain fairly stable. A stable company enjoying steady sales at little to no growth is unlikely to experience significant changes in working capital over time - to maintain its level of sales the company does not need additional working capital; it does not need to invest in more inventory, or experience rising receivables in line with increased sales, etc. To maintain the level of sales it only needs to incur normal expenses (and not make any one-off, non-cash and unusual expenses, or cash outlays for additional working capital).Therefore, the ""normal"" earnings (owner earnings, or free cash flow) should be given by:""Normal"" Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Change in Working Capital - Maintenance Capital Expendituresor""Normal"" Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization + Other Non-Cash Charges and Unusual Expenses - Maintenance Capital Expenditures.For the fiscal year 2018 we can estimate normal, no-growth free cash flow as follows:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(1) ""Adjusted"" Operating Cash Flow= Operating Cash Flow - Change in Working Capital= 4,674 - (-3,460)= 8,134Why remove change in working capital from operating cash flow? Under normal, no-growth circumstances the Company does not need to invest additionally in accounts receivable or incur (as) significant voluntary pension contributions - to maintain its level of sales the Company does not need to ""spend"" more on working capital (receivables, inventory, etc.); changes in working capital will generally average to zero in no growth scenario.Alternative method yielding same results would be to simply take Net Income and add back Depreciation & Amortization and other non-cash & unusual charges for 2018.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) Capital Expenditures:Since 2009, FedEx has on average spent 8.44% of sales on capital expenditures. This can be used as a reasonable and quite conservative assumption for routine maintenance capital expenditures.Capital Expenditures= (CapEx % of Sales) x 2018 Sales= 8.44% x 65,450= 5,524---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The above (1) and (2) give ""normal"" free cash flow for fiscal 2018:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""Normal"" Free Cash Flow= ""Adjusted"" Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures= 8,068 - 5,524= 2,544= $9.60/share ($9.75/share, as of Dec. 14, 2018 due to lower share count)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We can do the same for the last 5 years, as the table below illustrates (notice that we have also adjusted for lower US corporate tax rate, from approximately 34% to 21% for the years prior to 2018 - otherwise the numbers would not be helpful as an indication for future earning power):(Source: Morningstar, Author calculations)Averaging the above ""normal"" free cash flow per share for the last 5 years gives us $8.29/share. While we may have taken the long way, this adjusted free cash flow gives a better picture of the true earning power of the Company, as is evident by its steady growth in line with both rising sales and reported earnings. It gives us the actual ""owner earnings"" for each year.To understand this, e.g. in 2017 FedEx had operating cash flow of $4.930 billion, which was less than it could otherwise have had under normal no-growth circumstances, because the Company invested approximately $2.202 billion in working capital. Under normal circumstances the operating cash flow would then have been higher, or $7.132 billion (this is the ""adjusted"" operating cash flow). In addition, normally the Company would be expected to spend 8.44% of sales on capital expenditures, yielding $5.091 billion, eventually giving us ""normal"" or ""adjusted"" free cash flow of $2.631 billion ($9.75/share) in fiscal 2017, after accounting for lower tax rate.Instead of adjusting the cash flows we could have calculated normal earnings each year by adding D&A and other non-cash or unusual charges to net income and then subtract capital expenditures.Using the ""normal"" free cash flow of $9.6/share for fiscal 2018 would give investors a free cash flow yield of 5.9%. However, to only use last year's owner earnings as an indication of expected future normal earnings may be quite aggressive. Averaging the last three years gives $9.26/share (5.7% yield) and last five years gives $8.29 (5.1% yield), based on each year's share count (those numbers become a little bit higher when accounting for the current lower share count).However, it is worth noting that in 2018 the Company's effective tax rate was only 5%. Had it been the normal 21% rate, net income (and thus free cash flow) would have been lower by approximately $1.133 billion. This would have resulted in free cash flow of $1.477 billion, or $5.43 per share ($5.66 as of Dec. 14, 2018 due to lower share count) and only 3.5% yield. Taking this into account would give us average free cash flow of $7.5-$8/share for the last 3-5 years.So, if FedEx stopped growing from this point forward and consistently maintained its current level of sales ($65.5 billion) - not having to invest in additional working capital, making minimal pension contributions, spending 8.44% of sales on maintenance CAPEX, and having the same margins as in fiscal 2018 - investors should expect to get approximately $5.66/share annually (3.5% yield).While $5.66/share seems strange compared to e.g. 2017 or 2016, the operating cash flows tend to vary quite a bit and include various and significant one-off items that differ from year to year (e.g. ""Deferred income taxes and other noncash items"" had -$231 million effect on cash flow in 2018 but +$909 million in 2017, and ""Retirement plans mark-to-market adjustment"" had a positive +$1,498 million effect in 2016 (see Annual report 2018)). The Company is also quite capital intensive, requiring greater expenditures with higher levels of sales, and gross margins have also come down a little since 2016. So, in 2018 the Company sold more but at greater cost (at 21% tax rate net income was almost the same in 2018 as in 2017). The capital intensity and somewhat uncertain cash flows are also visible in the relatively low dividend ($2/share in 2018, less than 2% yield).For these reasons it may be prudent to look at the average free cash flow (average owner earnings), which is in the range of $7.5-$8/share for the last 3-5 years (3-year average is $7.87/share while 5-year average is $7.46/share). With lower share count of roughly 261 million shares outstanding as of December 14, 2018 the 3-year average becomes roughly $8/share (5-year average just around $8/share also). If we want to be more conservative we can see that normal free cash flow has been at or above $2 billion since 2014, which could give us a lower-bound estimate of $7.66/share. This is not unreasonable; with ""adjusted"" operating cash flow at around $7 billion in 2018 and 2017, and CAPEX likely to be around $5 billion (it may be somewhat higher today since FedEx is making ""investments in aircraft fleet modernization and the Memphis and Indianapolis hub modernization and expansion programs"", source), roughly giving us ""normal"" free cash flow of approximately $2 billion.The lower earnings outlook due to European weakness and slowing global trade (mitigated to some extent by cost reduction), possible competition (Amazon? (AMZN)) and some margin pressures, and likely at least some voluntary pension contributions, while considering the relative variability of cash flows due to one-off charges and the fact that we may be at peak levels in the business cycle, further make looking at the average as an indication of what we can expect to get under normal circumstances more sensible.Therefore, it is reasonable to assume sales (and thereby operating cash flow) to be around the 3-year average, CAPEX to be 8.44% of sales, and we prefer to assume no growth. Thus, by looking at the last three years for indication of earning power (instead of just last year's results), investors should perhaps rather expect to be able to get around $8/share annually, or around 5% free cash flow yield on average, but with some fluctuations from year to year and possible suppression in times of growth, that is to say if recent years are any indication of what is to come.This would make the shares of FedEx currently quite fairly valued, while giving investors the potential for further growth as an added benefit over time.Following a disappointing earnings release for fiscal Q2 2019 shares of FedEx dropped sharply by approximately 12% to $162.5/share.Despite the drop, the shares are not undervalued and look quite fairly valued.Investors should expect to get or be able to get on average around $8/share annually in earnings (free cash flow), along with potential for further growth. This would result in around 5% annual free cash flow yield at the current price of $162.5/share.Investors might still err on the side of caution and eek their estimates toward the lower end of expected normal earnings since earnings may come under pressure as trade slows down, capital expenditures remain high, sales peak at the late stages of the business cycle with margins potentially remaining lower, and cash flows fluctuating due to various irregular factors (such as pension contributions, TNT Express integration, legal matters, etc.).In general, there are a lot of factors that can affect the ultimate earnings to investors; the Company is quite complex and capital intensive, and not very easily predictable in terms of free cash flow - it would certainly be preferable if the Company required less capital spending and delivered more stable free cash flow with fewer non-core-related issues outstanding. Thus, quite a lot of uncertainty surrounds the estimate, so investors would be wise to apply sufficient margin of safety when considering a purchase.If the price falls further FedEx may become an attractive buy, but at the current moment it is at best moderately attractive and quite fairly valued."
4229708,92986,2018-12-21T15:11:19-05:00,"The FedEx stock price is down 30% in December erasing a large part of the post-2016 rally.It's not the second quarter of 2019 that disappointed investors, it's the outlook that got hit by falling economic expectations.Further underperformance is likely as we are dealing with a ""stay on the sidelines"" stock at this point.","The most recent earnings release of shipping giant FedEx (FDX) gives me mixed feelings. On one hand, we have strong second quarter earnings that were completely offset by a lower outlook and warning about the state of the economy. On the other hand, it is exactly what one could have expected when looking at leading indicators. Overall, it remains a case of ""stay away"" until macro indicators warrant a new entry. Source: FedExStarting with the good news, we see that the EPS trend is doing quite well. Second quarter EPS hit $4.03 which is exactly in line with expectations. It is also $0.85 higher compared to Q2 of 2018 which translates to a growth rate of 27%. This is one of the highest growth rates of the past few years. Source: EstimizeThe same goes for sales. Sales totaled $17.8 billion in the second quarter which is 9% higher from $16.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. It is also more or less in line with expectations of $17.7%. Adjusted operating income improved 7.26% to $1.33 billion from $1.24 billion in Q2/2018. Adjusted operating margins declined from 7.6% to 7.5%. Second quarter growth was supported by higher volumes, increased yields and a favorable impact of fuel at all transportation segments. The company was also able to offset some costs due to lower variable compensation expenses. In addition to these lower variable compensation expenses, the company implemented four additional measures to reduce costs. The result is a strong long term trend of sales, margins and net income. Operating margins have been in a very long sideways trend to be fair, but sales and net income continue to soar. FDX Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsSo why did the stock tank after earnings? Everything went right until the company mentioned the economic environment. This perfectly makes sense and is a good confirmation of the trend of major leading indicators. In my most recent article about the bigger economic trend, I discussed both the US and major international economic power areas like the Euro Area. The leading Euro Area manufacturing PMI has been in a downtrend since the start of this year, erasing the entire uptrend since the start of 2016. Source: TradingEconomicsAnd here we are, major transportation companies are feeling the pain. FedEx is too big to avoid economic cycles. This includes the US and international markets since the company generates roughly one third of its sales outside of the US. Anyhow, it's not just talk. Unfortunately for FedEx shareholders, the outlook has been downgraded as a result of economic growth slowing. Full year (fiscal 2019) EPS predictions are down to the $12.65 - $13.40 range from the previous range of $15.85 - $16.45. And management added another important point. These expectations are based on current growth levels.In general, I would say that almost every single full year outlook is based on past performance and current trends. However, I think we could see further downside revisions as long as the trend is down. This downward trend is currently being monitored by FedEx. FedEx is down roughly 30% in the month of December. The stock has erased the biggest part of its post-2016 rally and is trading at 2015 levels with a valuation of 8 times next year's earnings. That's not something you want to short right? My main point is to avoid the stock. The graph below shows the ratio spread between FedEx and the S&P 500 compared to the leading ISM manufacturing index. Generally speaking, FedEx can be considered to be a go-to stock during economic upswings. During a downtrend, you want to avoid this transportation stock. At this point, we are seeing that the ratio has fallen to 2016 levels, indicating that pessimism among FedEx traders is very high. So, even after this disastrous month of December, I am not buying the stock. Yes, a short term upswing thanks to bottom buyers is possible. However, we should not forget that we are dealing with a macro stock that exactly tells us what we expected - growth is slowing. And as harsh at it sounds, my opinion is to let it fall until economic growth bottoms. At that point, you get to buy a beaten down transportation beauty at a beautiful valuation. And by ""transportation beauty,"" I am referring to the company's ability to exploit economic strength thanks to its global business model. This unfortunately is also the reason why this stock is a case of ""staying on the sidelines.""I'll keep you updated!Thank you for reading my article. Please let me know what you think of my thesis.

4234771,103830,2019-01-22T14:32:55-05:00,Shares are now trading at a much more reasonable level.Strong moat will endure for the foreseeable future.Growth will be slightly better than global GDP growth.,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a multinational courier/delivery services company based in Memphis, Tennessee. Currently, FDX segments their business results into 4 major categories which include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. FedEx Express and FedEx Ground currently make up over 80% of the company's revenue. In the past 14 years, the company has grown revenue at CAGR of 7% and EPS at a CAGR of just under 13% (Source: FDX SEC Filings). This impressive growth has led FDX to become a very popular stock with its shares once trading as high as $274 per share which represented a multiple of 17 based on their latest 2019 earnings estimates. Recently, however, a readjustment to its earnings forecast has brought the stock price down significantly to as low as $150 in the past few months. For many, this may seem like a good entry point for this stock; however, I believe the current price more accurately reflects its intrinsic value based on the true owner's earnings of the company and a more reasonable growth rate.(Source: Created by Author from SEC Filings)It would be very difficult for a new entrant into the logistics space to effectively compete with FedEx. One of the most obvious reasons for this is the asset intensity of their business. FDX has total assets in the range of $57 billion which include a fleet of 670 aircraft and 180,000+ trucks and approximately 5,000 operating facilities around the world (Source: FDX Presentation). You cannot replicate a network of this size in a short amount of time even if you had the money and it guaranteed you market dominance. The value proposition that FDX brings to a customer is that they have an efficient and transparent operating network to almost anywhere in the world regardless of the relative imbalance of trade/demand between certain regions. For example, when someone wants to ship a parcel, they generally don't want to look through a dozen companies to see which ones ship to specific destinations. The expectation is that if one were to ship a parcel with FDX, it will get to wherever they need it to, reliably and quickly. But the problem is that not all trade routes are high in demand. There are a lot more shipments being sent between New York and Toronto than there are between Sudbury and Kalamazoo, but the customer's expectation is that you can delivery anywhere. This requires FDX to have assets and reliable partners set up everywhere. In order to operate this type of network profitably, efficiently and reliably, the company must have scale and high asset utilization. All of these have a huge impact on being able to provide a low-cost profitable network for package delivery.Currently, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is starting to take more control of their shipments in an effort to decrease costs and provide better service in order to ensure their delivery commitments can be fulfilled to their customers (Amazon Article) but does this mean that they can translate this into a business that can significantly impact FDX? If Amazon were to expand beyond shipping its own items (which is not an irrational thought), then it would have to invest a significant amount of capital and energy to establish the same level of network in order to appeal to a broader spectrum of businesses and other customers. The volume of shipments would have to increase significantly in order to compete with FDX so that they can get the same benefits of scale than that which is currently being driven from Amazon internally. I am not entirely convinced that Amazon or any others could penetrate this moat right now.Today, the market cap for FDX is $46 billion with an Enterprise value of $60 billion. I would expect to pay a multiple of 18 for a company that has an identifiable moat, moderate growth expectations, and a relatively good reputation for the efficient allocation of its capital. This required multiple would translate to required earnings of $2.5 billion based on FDX's market cap today. Does FDX have this level of cyclically adjust owners' earnings given the evidence that is presented to us in their 10-Ks? When I look at their history of cash flow from operations and subtract their depreciation and amortization charges, I come to the conclusion that their owners' earnings are closer to $2-2.3 billion. This is slightly above what I deem required at today's stock price.(Source: Created by Author from SEC Filings)At $274 per share, however, FDX had a market cap of $68 billion which would require an assumption of a lot higher expected growth rate or an assumption of higher owners' earnings.(Source: Created by Author from SEC Filings)Assuming my owner's earnings estimate is correct, the growth rate that is being assumed on shares trading at $274 would have to be around 23% per year which is very unrealistic considering EPS has compounded at the low double digits in the past 15 years. Someone could justify buying at those high levels if they thought FDX was about to experience a catalyst breaking point in earnings in the near future, but I have not seen too much evidence that would suggest this. If anything, there is much more evidence to suggest that their growth rates may decrease in the future due to cyclicality, more competition, and temporary roadblocks having to do with global trade. FDX is a very capital-intensive business and in order to compete, they not only have to buy large expensive assets but they also have to maintain them. Their capital expenditures have regularly exceeded the cash generated from their operations. While a considerable amount of this has been designated for growth initiatives, the returns generated off these new assets have gradually decreased in the past 10 years. Perhaps this is the cost of building out their moat by investing in the network for the long term. Once this network and investment cycle is established, FDX could go through a cycle of focusing on reaping the benefits through pricing, but even if that were to occur, the stock price still does not necessarily have too much more upside.(Source: Created by Author from SEC Filings)(Source: Created by Author from SEC Filings)While I believe that FDX has a very strong moat that will not be penetrated in the near term, I also do not believe that the stock is evidently priced below its intrinsic value. FDX has spent a lot of money in the past 10 years on growth initiatives in an effort to reassert their network dominance and should benefit from this investment, but the company still does not seem underpriced. That being said, it is a stock that is cheaper than the overall market and likely has better growth expectations over the next 10 years compared to the S&P. Based on my owners' earnings estimate of $2-2.3 billion, I believe the intrinsic value of FDX shares to be between $137 and $160."

        The company recently replaced the FedEx Express President in a confirmation sign that the issue is Europe and internal management, not Amazon.
        The stock is down to about 10x reduced FY19 EPS estimates.","Along with FQ2 earnings, FedEx (FDX) dropped the bombshell that the package delivery company was making a big cut to earnings guidance. As predicted, the feared Amazon (AMZN) threat hasn't materialized, but international trade is now a major drag on their business. The EPS cut is painful, but the stock is incredibly mispriced at $160 now.Image Source: FedEx websiteThe best place to start is to digest the updated FY19 EPS guidance. FedEx provided the following EPS guidance targets at the following points in the last year:Clearly, the EPS cut is massive at the midpoint. FedEx left a very large variance of $1.10 between the low and high targets so the company is unclear of the level of the economic slowdown impact. At the midpoint, the company cut guidance by 8.3% for a period of only two quarters left in the year.Even the low end guidance is still above the $15.31 earned in FY18. The updated expectations aren't dire projections, rather just a dip from possibly aggressive guidance where FedEx was expecting a huge $2+ jump in EPS this FY or the equivalent of 14% growth.The company blames all of the weakness on Europe so some potential risk exists that the U.S. slows down in 2019 as well. Per CEO Fred Smith:CFO Alan Graff went on to explain on the earnings call that a lot of the issues are related to service mix in Europe:FedEx recently replaced the President of the FexEx Express unit giving the market an indication that problems might exist in Europe where the company has had significant problems with the integration of TNT Express. A big part of the cut is that the company isn't going to reach their goal of growing FedEx Express operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion over FY17 numbers by FY20.Note that just missing the goal by $250 million is equivalent to $1 per share in EPS. The good news is that the issue appears contained to fixable problems in Europe.The stock initially took a hit due to the Amazon fears as the online retailer expands their Amazon Air operations. The stock took another hit due to the loss of the FedEx Express President. Now, the stock is taking a hit due to EPS cuts from the updated guidance related to the prior issue with FedEx Express.The stock has now taken too many hits and dipped to a forward P/E multiple of about 8x, down from nearly 15x. While the FY20 estimates are likely to dip further from the current estimate above $18, one can easily argue that the stock could return to the previous multiple on an EPS stream of $17 next year. Such a move would place the stock back at $255.The key investor takeaway is that FedEx continues to get hit from rolling issues. In this case, fixable economic and internal problems in Europe aren't reason to abandon the stock here.The biggest risk is that economic weakness spreads to the U.S. economy next year, but the stock is too beaten down already. FedEx might take awhile to turn, but investors should be ready to pounce when a bottom is in place.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

The thesis of the article was that I suspected we were likely to begin a bear market within three years and since FedEx (FDX) stock had a history of being very cyclical, the stock price had a high probability of falling quite far in a bear market. I suggested it would be wise to rotate out of FedEx and into Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), and shared the table below which depicted some of the key factors current FedEx shareholders might want to consider, like the speed at which the stock price could fall, how deep the plunge could be, and how long they might expect the stock to stay below its high price. Over the past 40 years, FedEx has had 9 sell-offs of 30% or more:Here is some of my commentary/analysis of the table from the previous article:I went on to do a risk/reward analysis of FedEx with the assumption that a bear market would begin after three years of projected price and dividend growth for the stock. Here was the conclusion:This estimate assumed a full three years worth of growth for the stock, so it was purposefully optimistic. It was assumed that if the stock started falling at some point sooner than three years, then the results would likely be worse. Even though I didn't think FedEx looked as overvalued as many of the cyclical stocks I had covered up until that point, I thought it would be wise to rotate out of FedEx and into Berkshire Hathaway. The idea behind this was that Berkshire would likely capture a lot of the upside if the market continued to move higher, but likely wouldn't fall nearly as far as FedEx if we had a bear market.For most investments, I try to let the strategy and the process do the heavy lifting. I spend as much time refining and developing strategies and processes as I do analyzing individual stocks. This is because if I can simply avoid psychological mistakes and be disciplined with the process and the research, I know that I can produce superior market returns as long as I get enough opportunities and my bets aren't too concentrated. The vast majority of my time is spent not coming up with ""winning"" investments but simply trying to avoid below-average investments and below-average cyclical timing. If one can do that, they will, almost by definition, produce above-average results.So, when developing this cyclical strategy, instead of asking the more common question of ""How much could this stock rise?"" I asked, ""How far could this stock fall?"" When I combined that question with a rejection of the popular assumption that volatility equals risk, I was able to develop a fairly unique strategy for evaluating stocks that have a history of high cyclicality. By getting defensive and rotating out of cyclical stocks near the top of the cycle, I realized it would create a high probability to purchase more shares, without paying any more money, near the bottom of the cycle. As long as the company was above average quality, I worked under the assumption that the business would likely recover from the downturn and so would the stock price.In order for all this to work one needs to 1) identify a quality company, 2) understand when it is overvalued, 3) get somewhat close at identifying the late-stages of the business cycle, 4) correctly identify a more defensive alternative, and 5) have the guts to rotate back into the stock when it looks like the world is ending near the bottom of the cycle.In my original FedEx article, I (1) identified FedEx as a quality company, but (2) thought that the stock had become overvalued if we were to start a bear market within three years. Given that the Federal Reserve had been raising rates for a couple years and was on track to continue, along with tax cut benefits being lapped in 2019 and that we had gone nearly a full decade without a bear market, I estimated that (3) mid-2019 could probably be a bear market, and I gave myself 18 months leeway on either side of that estimate, judging that the bear market could start anywhere from January 2018 to January 2021. I identified Berkshire Hathaway as a good defensive alternative (4) and estimated it would give an investor who rotated out FedEx and into Berkshire an opportunity to increase their shares by ~15% without spending any extra money. This current article is the first step of Part (5), having the guts to rotate back into the target stock. This is where I estimate two good entry points for the stock if one is in cash, and take a closer look to see if the ~15% expected share gain target I estimated back in March is still reasonable.Here is how the two investments have performed since the publication of the article:FDX Total Return Price data by YChartsIf one had rotated out of FedEx on March 15th and into Berkshire, they could now rotate back into FedEx and gain ~29% more shares than they had back in March at no extra cost. This surpassed my expected minimum goal of ~15% share gain. I'll consider the rotational trade I suggested in March a success, and now turn to those who may be waiting in cash (like me) looking for a couple good entry points for FedEx now that it has fallen over -35% from its highs.I use a medium-term investment time frame for cyclical investments, which has a maximum holding period of five years in most cases. For that reason, I usually only invest in companies that have a history of recovering from their price declines within five years. Looking at FedEx's previous downturns, I think making an initial purchase after a -40% decline and a potential second purchase after -60% decline is a reasonable strategy. All of FedEx's pre-1987 declines were right around -40% and with the exception of the 2015 decline, all of the declines from 1987 onward were deeper than -40% off the highs. Given that FedEx's price is very close to being -40% off its highs as I write this, I think there is an above average chance that it dips that far and gives investors a chance to make a purchase.The table below shows the results one would have had if they invested after a -40% decline in price during FedEx's previous downturns. The returns in the table do not include dividends. I annualized the returns and then compared them to the S&P 500 if bought and sold on the same dates, annualized. The goal is to see if historically buying after a -40% decline would be an alpha-producing strategy, so the last column is the alpha produced by the investment annualized relative to the S&P 500. All the percentages should be treated as estimates and are based on the approximate months held. If one buys after an ~40% decline and sells after the stock makes a full recovery, it produces an ~67% simple return, so that is the simple return for each of the investments in the table below.During 4 out of the 6 downturns, investing after a -40% decline would have been an alpha producing strategy. However, it would not have been an alpha producing strategy in the 1987 or the 2007 declines. Additionally, in the 1987 decline, an investor would have had to hold the stock for 74 months, which is 14 months beyond my preferred average holding period of 60 months.One way I account for situations like this is to plan for one additional entry point that is deeper than the first. In the case of FedEx, the stock price fell at least -60% during both the 1987 and the 2007 declines, so I'll use that as my second planned entry point to backtest. I'll also include an additional column in the table that shows the combined time-weighted alpha if one had invested both after a -40% and a -60% decline. The simple return if one invests after a -60% decline and sells after the stock makes a full recovery is 150% so that will be the simple return for the investments below.Making both purchases after a -60% decline would have made for an alpha producing investment in each case. Additionally, the average holding period in 1987 (38 months and 74 months) would have been 56 months, which is under the 60-month average I'm aiming for with this strategy. If one chooses to invest in FedEx during a major downturn, they are going to need to have some patience, though. It will likely take several years for the stock to fully recover its previous highs. On a positive note, FedEx has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 over that long period of time if investors are willing to hold on to the stock.I don't usually us P/E as a guide for cyclical investing, but I've seen a lot of comments about FedEx's valuation so I thought I'd throw in a F.A.S.T. Graph and some of my thoughts as a little bonus. When examining historical P/E for cyclical stocks, I like to pay attention to how much earnings drop during downturns. During the Great Recession, FedEx's earnings fell from $6.68 at their peak in 2006 to $3.76 in 2009. That's a decline of about -43%. The price fell ~72% during that time period. Earnings also declined ~3% during the 2001 recession, while the price declined ~45%. In 2015/16 the price declined ~33% while earnings grew 21%. Part of the explanation for the 2015/16 price decline was simply valuation. Going into that price decline FedEx's blended P/E was 22.7, but the multiple compressed down to 13.1 because FedEx's earnings growth slowed. The reason I'm sharing all this is that I want to point out that FedEx's earnings aren't nearly as cyclical as its price. Sure, earnings fell ~43% during the global financial crisis, but compared to some of the really cyclical stocks I cover that's not all that big of a decline. What really makes a difference with stocks like this is what sort of multiple they are trading at going into the downturn. In 1999, FedEx peaked at about 25.1, in 2005 about 23.1, and in 2015 about 22.7, but in 2018, the monthly multiple only peaked at about 18.1 according to F.A.S.T Graphs. Now, it's possible FedEx's growth will be much slower in the future or potential competition from Amazon will hurt their business at some point down the road, but a lot of that had to be priced into the stock already going into the current downturn.In short, I think most of any eventual stock price decline from here will be directly tied to actual earnings declines. The sentiment related declines that explain the gaps between price and earnings declines should be mostly finished once FedEx's price has dropped -40% off its highs.Those investors using the rotational strategy outlined in my original article can now rotate back into FedEx with an ~29% share gain. For those investors who like FedEx's business, but who are currently waiting in cash or some other defensive investment, I would aim to make my first investment around $164.80, and my second potential investment around $109.86 should the price fall that far.Those are the prices I'll be looking to buy, but FedEx will still have to pass one more round of analysis where I examine the business more closely to make sure there isn't something different with the company this time around that might prevent the stock price from recovering as it has in the past."
4229399,104543,2018-12-20T09:36:52-05:00,"FedEx has a great brand and durable moat.EPS is consistently higher than free cash flow per share.The company is capital intensive and has low cash generation.However, given some tailwind from P/E expansion we can experience 10% yearly returns over the next decade, but it all depends on the global economy.","With an estimated forward P/E of 10-11 FedEx (FDX) looks fairly cheap at these levels. The brand is well known and FedEx has a durable moat. The downside is lack of cash flow generation. EPS has consistently been much higher than free cash flow per share, and debt has increased from 0.75x EBITDA to 2x over the last 10 years.Since January 2018 the share price has fallen 35% from $275 to current price of $166. Given P/E expansion to 13 over the next decade, I expect about 10% annual returns.(This article was written before the earnings call on the 18th of December, where FedEx lowered guidance for 2019. Only some small edits were made after the earnings call.)The freight forwarding/express delivery business is pretty capital intensive. Warren Buffet once made his famous remark about the unprofitability of the airline industry and that the Wright Brothers should have been “shot”. FedEx is not a passenger airline but it has about 700 aircrafts, and hence the airline industry might be relevant. For comparison Ryanair has about 300 aircraft, Emirates has 260, Delta has 900, American has 950 and British Airways has 280 (according to various online sources).However, freight forwarding has historically performed better than traditional airlines. Some years back Credit Suisse made a graph showing the profitability and use of capital in the airline industry:Source: Credit Suisse.From this graph, albeit some years old, we can see that the freight/delivery industry has managed to get a positive return on invested capital of about 7-8% (as a group) during that business cycle. (Airlines have managed to increase earnings lately, and even Buffett invested in airlines).There are very few players in the global express delivery business. This graph from 2017 shows their market share:Source: Statista.com.In the US FedEx operates more like a duopoly with UPS (UPS).DHL is a part of Deutsche Post. TNT is a Dutch company, but since 2016 a subsidiary of FedEx, and acquired to get a stronger position in Europe. This means the global express delivery market functions close to an oligopoly with three players accounting for 89% of the market.FedEx is divided into four business units: FedEx Express (the “original” FedEx – express transportation operating globally), FedEx Ground (small package ground delivery in the US and Canada) and FedEx Freight (less-than-truckload freight in the US, Canada and Mexico). In addition they have FedEx Services, but this unit operates more like support to the other three units doing e-commerce, customer billing, back office and technology (it operates at a small loss). FedEx Ground is the unit growing the most and has the highest margins:During the last 10 years FedEx has grown much more than its biggest local rival UPS.Chairman and CEO is Frederick Smith. He was the founder of FedEx back in 1971 and has been the CEO since then. He has taken the company from nothing to become a global giant, so most likely it’s hard to find any better man in this position. He is 74 years old, so a change looks likely pretty soon. According to this article FedEx has a mandatory retirement age at 75. He currently owns 14.74 million shares, 5.4% of the company. According to Morningstar, key insiders own 15.26 million shares, where CFO holds second most with 165 740 shares. In other words, apart from CEO insider ownership is small.The share price including dividends has since January 2000 returned 9% per year, much better than the S&P 500 with about 6% (source: Yahoo Finance). CAGR of EPS was 11% during the last 10 years and return on invested capital has averaged 9.5% (source: Morningstar).Source: Yahoo Finance.Obviously this is a business that requires a lot of capital to grow. CAPEX has grown 9% per year over the last 10 years, and 9% of revenue is spent on CAPEX. The cash conversion rate is just 4% of maintenance CAPEX, see further explanation below (of $100 in sales, $4 end up as free cash flow).Free cash flow generation (after CAPEX) has not managed to keep up with the growth in the EPS for a long time:Source: Morningstar and Macrotrends.net.I have seen numerous articles for the heavy CAPEX spending to end. I had a look at previous statements from FedEx, and in 2016 CFO Alan Graf said CAPEX would peak in 2016 with $4.6 billion. This has not happened. Instead it has increased every year and in 2018 it was $5.6 billion.If we in addition deduct funds returned to shareholders the cash flow looks like this:Source: Morningstar.Why is FedEx spending so much on CAPEX? It’s of course a capital intensive business and FedEx has invested heavily in fleet modernization and e-commerce solutions. Many of the increased capital expenditures have come from growth initiatives intended to increase profitability in the future. The following chart breaks down FedEx's maintenance and growth CAPEX:Source: My own calculations.As a proxy for maintenance I used depreciation and amortization (D&A). As a rough guide, companies' maintenance spending should approximate to its depreciation in the long run. Over the last 10 years D&A has been 61% of CAPEX. I assume the difference of 39% is for growth CAPEX.If we exclude growth CAPEX we get these numbers per share for free cash flow:Source: My own calculations. Blue bar is EPS.Excluding growth CAPEX the cash flow keeps track of earnings much better, but still huge variations.Most of the CAPEX is spent on modernizing FedEx’ massive fleet of almost 700 aircraft, which is almost 22 years old on average, and on e-commerce systems. Newer planes burn up to 20% less fuel, according to the CEO, but of total costs for 2018 fuel is only 5.5%. A reduction of 20% on fuel equals $675 million in savings all other things being equal, or $2.5 per share. Salaries are by far the biggest cost with 35% of the revenue, and FedEx expects a pilot shortage in the coming years which could pressure salaries upward.Just for comparison UPS' fleet is 19 years old, DHL's 22 years, Ryanair’s fleet is just six years and Southwest is 12 years. However, I believe carriers can get away with an older fleet as they obviously don’t have passengers and fly less, and to my knowledge maintenance cost is not necessarily lower than new planes. I believe it’s all about saving fuel.FedEx is no recession proof company. Although the share price went flat in 2002, it fell from 105 in January 2007 to the bottom of 40 in March 2009, a fall of 62%, more than the S&P 500. But the underlying business managed to generate positive cash flow both in 2008 and 2009.FedEx has an enormously valuable brand. But more importantly I believe they have a cost advantage and a favorable network effect due to their enormous scale of operations in over 200 countries.Their services are somewhat sticky: They have gradually built out more services to cover a wider area of customers’ needs, and this even makes them harder to displace. In 2009 DHL exited the US market after a failed attempt to gain a reasonably market share.There are huge barriers to entry. The sheer size and scope of the business/infrastructure is very hard to duplicate. Almost 700 aircraft, 5,000 hubs and 180,000 motorized vehicles make sure they are in a position to harm any new entrant by just cutting down its prices. DHL could probably verify that.The biggest risk is a severe recession over many years. No matter how cheap it looks today, a recession means FedEx takes a big hit in earnings and share price. However, this is part of any investment and it’s impossible to know for sure when the next recession hits. They survived easily the short recession of 2008/09, but their debt level was significantly lower back then.In the future Amazon might be taking a share of their business. You can read more about this here. Amazon would need to spend an enormous amount of money to increase their operations. Currently they are small compared to FedEx. The Amazon-effect also crushed the share price of both Kroger (KR) and Walgreens (WBA) earlier this year, and the latter has staged a comeback since then, and I believe the fears are overblown.Regulation and trade barrier is of course a hot topic now, but it’s anybody’s guess how this will turn out. But for the long-term I believe the world will continue becoming more integrated, and thus more trade across nations.FedEx started paying a dividend back in 2002. Here is the historical summary of yearly dividends:Source: FedEx website.The payout ratio is like this:Source: Morningstar.The dividend is still well covered by earnings, but free cash flow has not been able to cover both the dividend the last two years. Dividend growth since 2002 is a solid 16% but this of course can’t continue growing faster than EPS. Expect this number to come down to the upper teens more in line with EPS growth.Dividend yield is currently 1.4%. This is on the high end of the historical yield, but probably not very relevant as the dividend has been minimal before 2013.Source: My own calculations.During the last 10 years outstanding shares have shrunk from 312 to 271 million (13%). However, it’s just the last four years FedEx has bought back a meaningful number of shares.Free cash flow has suffered in recent years. At the same time long-term debt has increased from $2 billion in 2009 to about $16 billion today, a CAGR of 23%, a much higher increase than in EPS. Current debt level is around 2x of EBITDA, and in my opinion close to maximum for such a cyclical and capital intensive business. Perhaps this number comes down in the future simply by growing the business. But if we enter a recession that lasts some years, the debt load can be troublesome.If we add the operating cash flow for the last three years up to and including 2018, deduct maintenance CAPEX (D&A), buybacks and dividend in those years, total cash flow is only $1.1 billion. If we skip buy backs the cash flow increases to $5.3 billion for those three years. I use those numbers to put the debt in perspective, and clearly maintenance CAPEX is just an estimate for what the business requires of capital to keep the operations at status quo. Moody’s downgraded their debt in 2016 to Baa2, indicating “moderate” credit risk. This is two downgrades from being “not prime”.Because of a fluctuating EPS, the P/E level has been up and down:Source: My own calculations.Clearly, it has not often been as cheap as this.On the earnings call on the 18th of December FedEx lowered guidance. EPS excluding charges is now guided to $15.50-$16.60 vs. $17.20-$17.80 earlier. Global growth has slowed and the company can feel the headwind.FedEx has a durable moat, the brand is top notch, there are big barriers to entry and great leadership. In addition the stock seems undervalued right now based on P/E. The only draw back is the lack of cash generation and the cyclical nature of the business. I am a bit skeptical if we will ever see any meaningful cash generation from the business. UPS generates more cash, but they have very little growth. This is the problem with capital intensive businesses.If you buy at today’s price of $166, what can you expect to get in return over the next decade or a full business cycle? My assumptions are this: P/E expands to 13 and both dividend growth and EPS growth is 8%. With these numbers the CAGR is about 10% until 2029. But because of the cyclical nature of the stock, the calculations are highly uncertain.The CAPEX requirements makes me prefer other types of companies. If I invest in cyclical companies, I prefer capital light businesses, like Atlas Copco for example. In addition, I prefer to buy cyclical companies during a recession, not after nine years of a bull market. Bear in mind that my investment horizon is infinite: I try to find stocks I would never sell."
4227203,50452,2018-12-08T16:46:37-05:00,"FedEx has seen a drastic drop in share price over the past six months. Especially more so recently as the markets become increasingly volatile.
        Despite fears of disruption to FedEx's business, the company is doing well. Amazon and China aren't as big a threat as headlines imply.
        The stock offers a fast growing dividend, and a stunningly cheap earnings multiple for investors to consider.","The recent bearishness in markets has really brought the hammer to stocks. One of the hardest hit stocks recently, has been FedEx Corporation (FDX). The stock has been pummeled due to a mix of fears ranging from Amazon's (AMZN) own shipment ambitions, to the ongoing trade conflict with China, to concerns over an economic slow down. Setting fresh 52 week lows at the end of the week, shares have become severely undervalued. We review why these fears shouldn't keep investors from considering the shipping giant.source: YchartsShares have been gyrating lower for months, but have really fallen off the deep end lately. Shares have lost 21.9% over the past six months, with about half of that just recently. This extreme movement compared to the S&P 500 appears fear driven by factors that are a bit overstated when you look at the specifics. source: YchartsThe company is doing just fine operationally. The company has accelerated its revenue growth with a 10 year CAGR of 5.60%, a five year CAGR of 8.13%, and a 3 year CAGR of 11.31%. Similar acceleration has occurred for earnings per share, that have grown at a 10 year CAGR of 16.65%.The company continually grabs a larger slice of a growing pie, by expanding its market revenue share of ground shipments and LTL shipments over time.source: FedEx CorporationAlthough the company's profits missed estimates last quarter due to bonus and wage increases, management still raised full year guidance from $17.00-$17.60 to $17.20-$17.80.There are some scary headlines making the rounds in recent months that investors fear will negatively impact the business. The first of the two major headlines is Amazon's continued ambitions to take over their own delivery. This has been a topic that you will hear increasingly more about as they work to make this a reality. But the reality is that this will not have some sort of crippling effect on FedEx's revenues. Management has repeatedly stated that no more than 3% of the company's revenues come from one single customer. Even if Amazon pulls all of its business from FedEx, there are growth tailwinds in place that should fill that hole (more on that below).The other major disruptor has been the ongoing trade conflict with China. This has been a concern throughout the year, and has intensified this week with the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Canada. The quantifiable impact of the China conflict on FedEx is small. Management has stated that shipments involving China are only about 2% of the business. However, it was also indicated that the anxiety of the conflict has had a negative ripple effect throughout other shipping markets. We see this dissipating over time, as companies find logistical ""work arounds"" if the conflict lasts. Despite these issues, management still proceeded to raise guidance for the year.There are a number of tailwinds in place to suggest that business will remain strong for shipment companies. source: IMFDespite the trade conflict, the overall global economy is forecasted to grow 3.9% in 2019 (according to IMF). Minor slowdowns in advanced economies such as the US will be counteracted by growth in emerging markets. Long term projections show overall GDP at a slight downtrend, but steady overall.Trends in consumer transactions also favor shipment companies. Retailers ramping up online efforts to compete with Amazon will provide additional opportunities for FedEx and its peers.source: Credence ResearchThere is still a large runway for growth as large portions of the world still need to catch up to countries like the US in the digital age. On both the business to consumer and business to business scales, there are still opportunities for logistics companies to grow. Not many companies have the size, distribution infrastructure, and cost advantages that FedEx possesses.FedEx flies a bit under the radar as a dividend growth stock, but the company has grown its dividend for 17 consecutive years. The dividend pays quarterly to shareholders, and yields 1.21% on the current stock price. source: YchartsThough the current yield may not excite income focused investors, the dividend has grown at a strong rate over time. FedEx has grown the payout at an incredibly robust 16.5% CAGR over the past 10 years. The most recent increase was a whopping 30% (partly due to beneficial tax reform). The payout is a small slice of earnings, so expect strong dividend growth in the near future.source: YchartsWith the market tanking throughout the week, the past five days have been brutal for the share price of FedEx. The company ended the week by setting fresh 52 week lows. We see strong value in shares at this price.Based on management's most recent full year guidance of $17.50 earnings per share (midpoint), the stock currently trades at 11.48X full year earnings. Given the stock's 10 year median PE ratio of 19.27X, the current multiple represents a 40% discount against historical norms. Even if we use a 15X fair value multiple, there is potential upside from these levels of 23%.For dividend growth investors, the dividend yield is also very generous at the current trading level. While it may seem small, the current yield of 1.21% is drastically higher than the stock's 10 year median yield of 0.58%. Acquiring high growth dividend streams at yields higher than historical norms is a positive scenario.Investors will want to keep an eye on the balance sheet moving forward. Debt is common for companies that spend large amounts on capital expenditures such as FedEx. source: YchartsHowever, FedEx's debt has crept higher over the past five years and now sits at 2.0X EBITDA. I don't like to see companies stretch their balance sheet past 2.5X, so this remains something to keep an eye on. We are still in a low interest rate environment from a historical perspective, but rising interest rates can pose problems for companies with high debt loads.The current downtrend in the overall market has proven that FedEx shares will be subject to the currents of the market in the short term. If you invest for the fundamentals, FedEx looks appealing at its current level. The business appears poised to continue its current growth trajectory, and headline grabbing fears of disruption don't have as material an impact on FedEx as you might be led to believe. The markets can be fickle in the short term, but can reveal bargains during times of mass hysteria.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4229485,23452,2018-12-20T14:50:00-05:00,Quantitative analysis of FedEx and UPS shares using the power of free cash flow.Analysis of FedEx and UPS from a Main Street vs. Wall Street perspective.Suggests a much better alternative investment for our readers.Shows the reader how to do a similar analysis on their own portfolio holdings.,"On Dec.18, 2018, Seeking Alpha News Editor Stephen Alpher reported the following: FedEx off nearly 5% after cutting guidance, UPS dips alongside, and then the following morning he gave us this; FedEx's ""jarring"" guidance cut. Clearly this news had a negative impact on shares of United Parcel Service (UPS) as well as other companies in its industry since FedEx (FDX) is a dominant player in the Air Delivery and Freight Services Industry.The FedEx guidance cut came as no surprise to the subscribers of our Seeking Alpha Marketplace offering Friedrich Global Research, as our Friedrich Algorithm's datafiles and charts clearly warned our subscribers (well ahead of time) that something like this news would eventually show up as both FedEx's and UPS's results on Main Street have been deteriorating quite rapidly for sometime.In this article, I will not discuss the various operations of each company and how each is doing, as you can read many such articles on Seeking Alpha, both pro and con. What I will simply do is a quantitative analysis of both FedEx and UPS results on Main Street and then relate them to what an investor should do on Wall Street, using zero emotion.Let us begin by explaining Main Street vs. Wall Street analysis.In analyzing FedEx and UPS, we will present some unique ratios that our Friedrich Investing System uses and will present a real-time quantitative analysis that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. In doing so, we also will teach everyone how to analyze one's portfolio holdings on Main Street vs. Wall Street. At the same time, we will explain how the methodology involved in this analysis came about.Main Street is where FedEx and UPS operate and Wall Street is where each company’s shares trade. The FedEx and UPS shares that one can purchase on Wall Street are traded publicly on exchanges and each company has little control over how those shares will trade. FedEx and UPS are both required to release earnings reports every quarter and, from time to time, each also provide press releases to shareholders (and the general public) giving updates on how each company’s operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where both FedEx and UPS invest and sell to its customers. How well the management of each company does in selling those products determines how profitable each will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer (or even just a smart phone), an Internet connection, and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street.This results in Wall Street being a very dangerous place to operate as many investors tend to invest through emotion or follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic and be like lemmings stampeding over the cliff. Thus, we have the classic case of ""greed vs. panic.""Having noticed this problem some 35 years ago, I spent the last three decades building an algorithm called Friedrich. Our algorithm was designed to assist all investors (both pro and novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company's Main Street operations to its Wall Street valuation (Overbought or Oversold condition). Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, mutual fund, or individual portfolio with the use of our Portfolio Analyzer. I recently did so when I compared Apple ( AAPL) to the S&P 500 Index: (SPY) Apple Vs. The S&P 500: Which Is The Better Investment?Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A) (BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett called ""Owner Earnings,"" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett's version of free cash flow. To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explained how to use it to identify companies with superior prospects and basically states that it's one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.""[Owner earnings] represent [A] reported earnings plus [B] depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges… less [C] the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.""I have employed the free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009.The backtest mentioned above demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 (or less) times its price to free cash flow ratio, that the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. I have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio in honor of both men. The following is how that ratio is calculated.Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor / [(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))The above are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street, and below are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Main Street.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)The FROIC ratio tells us how much forward free cash flow we can expect the company to generate on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow it, therefore, has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (66 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it's our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, Wall Street will eventually take notice.So, let us begin our analysis and at the same time try to teach everyone how to do a similar analysis on one's own portfolio. In analyzing both FedEx's and UPS's Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio, we must first adjust each company’s Wall Street Price to account for its debt using our Sherlock Debt Divisor. Below is a detailed definition of that ratio and how we use it.A major concern that I have these days in analyzing companies is the debt burden relative to its operations and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt also can be excessive and put a company's future in jeopardy. So what I have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely (excessively) and rewards companies that successfully use debt as leverage. How do I do this? Well, I take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt I reward it but punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this result is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment.Thus, having successfully defined the Sherlock Debt Divisor, we need the following four bits of financial data in order to calculate it for both companies. TTM (trailing twelve months) is as close to real-time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. The current analysis for FedEx is taken from its Aug. 31, 2018, filing with the SEC and for UPS we will use its Sept.30, 2018, filing with the SEC (except the Market Price per share).Market Price Per Share = $167.65Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $12,641,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $9,606,000,000Working Capital = $3,035,000,000Long-Term Debt = $15,251,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 269,000,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/ (Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $167.65 - ((3,035,000,000 - $15,251,000,000)/ 269,000,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $167.65 - ($-45.41) = $213.06Since FedEx has more long-term debt vs. working capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $213.06 as our new numerator in all our calculations.Market Price Per Share = $95.61Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $13,991,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $12,222,000,000Working Capital = $1,769,000,000Long-Term Debt = $20,101,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 877,700,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/ (Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.61 - ((1,769,000,000 - $20,101,000,000)/ 877,700,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.61 - ($-20.88) = $116.49Since UPS has more long-term debt vs. working capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $116.49 as our new numerator in all our calculations.Now that we have completed calculations of the Sherlock Debt Divisor for each company, let us now go do the Wall Street analysis for each.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $213.06Net Income per diluted share = $4,811,000,000/269,000,000 = $17.88Depreciation per diluted share = $3,152,000,000/269,000,000 = $11.71Capital Spending per diluted share = $-5,798,000,000/269,000,000 = $21.55$17.88 + $11.71 - ($21.55) = $8.04Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $213.06/$8.04 = 26.50Now, if one goes to our Friedrich Legend (definitions of what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 26.50 is considered average where anything over 30 is considered bad. Remember that the 26.50 is the result after the recent sharp market price drop and before that it would have been over 30.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $116.49Net Income per diluted share = $5,439,000,000/877,700,000= $6.19Depreciation per diluted share = $2,256,000,000/877,700,000= $2.57Capital Spending per diluted share = $-6,009,000,000/877,700,000= $6.85$6.19 + $2.57 - (6.85) = $1.91Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $116.49/$1.91 = 60.99Now, if one again goes to our Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 60.99 is considered bad where anything under 15 is considered excellent.We last ran our data file for FedEx and UPS on Dec. 19, 2018, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers that FedEx and UPS are “Overbought” as our Friedrich Data File’s and Chart’s below show. There you also will find the last 10 years of FedEx’s and UPS's Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results.FedExUnited Parcel ServiceNow that we have taught everyone how to calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio. The following is how you calculate it for each company.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $4,811,000,000/269,000,000 = $17.88Depreciation per diluted share = $3,152,000,000/269,000,000 = $11.71Capital Spending per diluted share = $-5,798,000,000/269,000,000 = $21.55Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 3%[(($17.88 + $11.71) (103%)) - ($21.55) =$8.92Long-Term Debt = $15,251,000,000Shareholders Equity = $19,173,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 269,000,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$8.92/$127.97 =6.97%FROIC = 6.97%Now, if one goes to my Friedrich Legend again (on what's considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 6.97% is considered average and tells us that FedEx produces $6.97 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed on Main Street.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $5,439,000,000/877,700,000 = $6.19Depreciation per diluted share = $2,256,000,000/877,700,000 = $2.57Capital Spending per diluted share = $-6,009,000,000/877,700,000 = $6.85$6.19 + $2.57 - (6.85) = $1.91Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 7%[(($6.19 + $2.57) (107%)) - ($6.85) = $2.52Long-Term Debt = $20,101,000,000Shareholders Equity = $3,098,000,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 877,700,000FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$2.52/$26.43 =9.53%FROIC = 9.53%Once again, if one goes to my Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 9.53% is considered AVERAGE and tells us that UPS produces $9.53 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed on Main Street.On Main Street, both FedEx and UPS are doing average, while on Wall Street each can be considered overbought.Going forward, things are surely getting tough for the two top players in the Air Delivery and Freight Services industry and with FedEx’s dramatically lowered guidance, it seems that those holding shares in either FedEx or UPS may find better returns elsewhere. A possible alternative is a company in the Integrated Shipping and Logistics industry that goes by the name Landstar System (LSTR). Landstar System is a nationwide dispatcher for independent truckers and business is booming in that industry, to the point where there's a shortage of drivers in order to meet the demand. From a Friedrich Algorithm point of view, Landstar System is considered to be oversold or very attractive right now.Landstar System, as you can see from the Friedrich Datafile above, has a FROIC of 44%, which means for every $100 of invested capital the company spends on Main Street, it generates $44 in free cash flow. That's many times greater than the FROIC that both FedEx and UPS generate. Its Price to Bernhard Buffett ratio result also is excellent coming in at 12.57. Finally, Landstar System also is a very consistent performer on Main Street as its 10 years of FROIC numbers also are excellent. These facts about Landstar System have been obviously overlooked by Wall Street investors, which allows Landstar System to trade at what our Friedrich Algorithm considers a bargain price. This is the polar opposite of what Friedrich thinks of FedEx and UPS.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4228743,104579,2018-12-17T12:23:00-05:00,"FedEx has dropped dramatically on concerns that have yet to present themselves.With the stock falling so much already, any negative news seems to have been priced in.I have been adding every time it drops.","SourceFedEx (FDX) has seen its shares drop rather quickly and unjustifiably. The only news we know of is that the head of the Express division announced his retirement unexpectedly, and there is a potential economic slow down although it is not showing up anywhere on U.S. soil or economic data besides housing.Consumer spending is still strong and FedEx guided higher last quarter leaving me to believe that unless they guide downward in the upcoming earnings report, that the stock is really oversold. The company really just needs to confirm their outlook and the stock should rise back to where it was a few weeks ago. In the meantime, investors would be wise to take advantage of the unjust sell-off.FedEx reported earnings that were just fine last quarter. Actually, they were better than fine.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company reported double-digit revenue growth, however, missed earnings estimates by $0.36. While this may seem like a big deal, a further look shows it was not. Specifically the company referred to the miss on earnings being due to higher compensation costs and accelerated wage increases due to the tax cuts. Because of these higher costs, the company recognized a year-over-year difference of $170 million or $0.48 a share.A better picture of the company's performance can be seen below.SourceDespite the miss on analysts' estimates, the company still saw an increase in earnings from $2.19 to $3.10 or approximately 41.5%. Impressive growth for a company of FedEx's size.Additionally, the company increased its fiscal 2019 earnings per share outlook and now expects the following:All signs of a strong and booming company with little to worry about from an investor perspective. I would argue the shares should have moved higher and not lower but I am biased as a shareholder.The company also has a strong balance sheet.Source: 10-QWith approximately $2.37 billion in cash versus $16.94 billion in total debt, the company stands with a net debt position that is around $14.57 billion. Nothing to be alarmed about as a deeper look reveals this is less than 2x EBITDA/Debt leverage and since the company continues to grow its EBITDA at a healthy pace there is not much to worry about here.The company continues to offer a broad range of services making it a leading selection by its customers to be the shipper of choice.Source: Investor PresentationWith Express making up such a large portion of sales, we now understand why the recent news of the CEO retiring was unexpected. Since the company did this on such short notice, it is seen as a worrisome sign by some that the Express division is not performing up to par. I believe this to be overblown, and expect the upcoming earnings report to verify this. It was just 3 months ago that management and the CEO saw such strong growth from this division that they raised their forecast. It is highly unlikely with the continued strength in retail sales that anything has changed.The CEO was quoted in the recent earnings report saying:An additional source of growth investors should look forward to is price increases.Along with volume growth, price increases will help pay for additional capital investment, grow revenue, and grow margin. Margin can be affected by such things as oil prices which the company can charge surcharges for, but recently oil has had a downturn which I think should further help the company at least for Q2 and Q3. This is something unexpected by the analysts at the moment.While FedEx continues to grow, it continues to do so by being better at its job.By being faster and sometimes even cheaper, the company has room to grow its pricing as well as its customer base. Having faster routes in a day and age where Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the consumer expectant of 2-day deliveries is an advantage that deserves a premium. This is also beneficial in marketing efforts to win new business and continue to capture the growing e-commerce sales that omni-channel retailers are so focused on.As you can see, the trend for e-commerce sales is ever-increasing.Source: StatisticaI prefer to benefit from this trend by owning shares in FedEx rather than any one retailer who can suffer from consistent market share battle. FedEx operates in a competitive environment but really it is a duopoly. Anything over 1lb in net weight is ideal to ship via FedEx or UPS (UPS). Because of this, they are the only two domestic players to compete with each other.Additionally, the company has increased its market share for almost 20 years and it can be attributed to continued investments in its network.As the company looks to add Saturday deliveries, this trend should improve further and capacity won't need to be added to gain anymore share. The ROI on this should be huge.Another attractive perk of FedEx is that it continues to grow its LTL or less than truckload share.This is the last mile services that companies like XPO Logistics (XPO) have been trying to grow in. As retailers try to ship larger and larger items and eliminate the need for in-store pick up, FedEx will continue to gain share. This is another beneficial item coming from omni-channel retail.Now, there are some concerns related to global trade which have impacted the business. The company states that it will be hurt by a slowdown in trade, but, I believe this issue will be resolved in the medium term allowing for the company to resume its strong growth. Investors should keep an eye on the earnings report for any potential significant impact in the last quarter due to tariffs, but I expect there to be minimal impact at this time. Any positive news regarding tariffs should also help lift the stock higher.Also, recent concerns due to Amazon have further punished the stock. Let's be clear, Amazon does not account for more than 2-3% of FedEx sales. On top of that, this part of the sales have low margins attached. On top of it all, part of these sales are attributed to third party sellers obtaining FedEx discounted rates when sending in product to be fulfilled by Amazon. Amazon does not have the capability or the network to replace this service.It also would take a significant amount of time to replicate the network at a cost-efficient manner to send products to virtually the entire country. Even if we saw just investments from Amazon in the major metro markets in which a heavy amount of sales are driven from, it would potentially put at risk 1% of sales from FedEx in my estimates. It also would probably not be that cost effective since the company would be purely using its own shipping services for its own sales channel and not providing shipping services for anyone else.Because of this, the company would not ideally have efficient routes. The threat of Amazon as a shipping competitor is really overblown. It should be noted that other retailers are gaining traction in their online sales and should continue to grow with FedEx negating any possible loss of sales with Amazon. Additionally, Amazon would have to ship to every possible part of the nation in order to compete with FedEx before it lost 100% of its business with Amazon. This would be many decades out at the very least. This is a minimal risk at this time.FedEx valuation is now very attractive. From its own 5-year trading history there has not been a better time to buy.Source: MorningstarThe P/E is less than 1/2 that of its average, its P/B, P/CF, PEG ratio, and P/S all show it is below average and below anywhere we could get shares recently.Furthermore, looking at the yield, we can see even if it returned to an abnormal compelling yield of 0.75%, the stock would be 85% higher. The shares now offer the highest yield since March of 2009.Source: Yield ChartDespite no ""Great Recession"" in sight, the stock is acting as if there is one.Looking at the daily RSI, we can see shares have an RSI of 23, which is below the typical oversold metric of 30.Source: StockchartsSo how does FedEx compare to its peer UPS?FDX data by YChartsWell, it appears that once again FedEx is cheaper on the above metrics leading me to believe that even if the stock was down to a market sell-off, the shares are below its less formidable peer.I have become overweight FedEx shares during the pullback with my most recent add at $186. I have been holding shares for over a year now and am amazed at the willingness of the market to overlook a superbly managed company operating in a space with limited competition. The growth story remains intact, the economy is still doing quite well, and the fears of Amazon are clearly overblown. Due to these factors, we have however seen shares sell off to levels that have not been seen in the last 5 years.I call it how I see it and I believe this is an opportunity for those looking for growth at a reasonable price. Also, investors can take joy in knowing every time they get a delivery from FedEx, they are earning money on their investment. I believe once management confirms guidance in the upcoming earnings report, we will see a move higher. If for any reason the earnings report is negative, I am not sure that the stock could fall much further as it already seems to be pricing in any negative news possible. For now, I continue to take the opportunity to add shares to my portfolio."
4227816,23757,2018-12-12T02:06:43-05:00,FedEx is down 30% since June on fears Amazon may enter the express air delivery market en-force.FedEx's current valuation looks to already be pricing in a complete loss of business from Amazon.FedEx stock could be a deal if things don't turn out as bad as the market fears.,"Since June, FedEx (FDX) stock has dropped almost 30% and trades at a forward P/E of under 12. While, the current stock market correction no doubt is playing a role, the biggest cause for the drop seems to be continued reports of Amazon (AMZN) encroaching on FedEx’s turf.Indeed, it’s now being reported that Amazon is exploring expanding its leased plane fleet from 40 to 100 and starting an Amazon Air express delivery service. The market seems perpetually scared of Amazon’s competitive threat. It treats every move as a forgone success despite the company’s mixed track record. We think that even if Amazon does eventually become a competitor to FedEx, the stock is cheap enough that the eventual outcome won’t matter.Right now, there looks to be two main areas where Amazon would take business from FedEx. The first is by no longer relying on FedEx for last mile delivery. Package delivery for Amazon is estimated to make up around 3% of FedEx’s revenue overall. The second area where Amazon could take business from FedEx is express air delivery via its Amazon Air service. FedEx gets about 19% of its overall revenue from domestic air.So how would this impact FedEx?Let’s look at things under a worst case scenario. If investors woke up tomorrow and FedEx got no business from Amazon and Amazon Air was now a major player in the express air market.The express air market is dominated by FedEx and UPS in the US. To make things easy, let’s just assume the market ends up split between those two and Amazon Air. Yes, almost all airlines are players in the market but individually they are all small compared to UPS and FedEx. For our worst case scenario, we’ll just assume they don’t exist and FedEx bears the brunt of the market share losses.FedEx has about 60% of the market while UPS has 40%. If we assume Amazon Air enters and takes about a 30% market share (divided equally between the incumbents), that gives us a 42% market share for FedEx, 28% for UPS, and 30% for Amazon.That means that if FedEx now gets 19% of its total revenue from domestic air it would lose 5.7% of its total revenue in a worst case scenario.The loss to FedEx’s ground business is easier to compute, 3% of revenues simply disappear.For our valuation, we elected to keep margins as they were. FedEx is likely well versed in optimizing the use of its assets and would likely be able to slim down its asset base to match its new volume without Amazon.From the company’s latest 10-Q, the margins for each segment were as follows:For its latest fiscal year, FedEx’s revenue and operating income were as follows:We used those figures when making adjustments for the “Amazon effect”. For the express air segment, we took 5.7% of overall revenue at a 7.1% profit margin. For the ground segment, we removed 3% of overall revenue with a 14.2% profit margin.We kept interest expenses the same and used the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%.Right now, FedEx is trading at around $188 per share which looks very attractive. Even if Amazon grows large enough to become a legitimate rival to FedEx and UPS, it’s still going to be a consolidated market. Additionally, as e-commerce grows, the shipping and delivery market will continue to grow as well. Once the Amazon threat is accounted for, FedEx should trade at least at a market multiple P/E.Additionally, this is a worst case scenario. Amazon is unlikely to simply come in and take 1800 basis points of market share from FedEx right off the bat. The market losses, if they even occur at that magnitude, will likely happen over a decade or two.For investors interested in cyclical stocks, FedEx certainly looks cheap due to a market overreaction about the threat of Amazon."
4229497,104941,2018-12-20T15:39:29-05:00,"FedEx has a free cash flow issue brought on by accelerating capital expenditures.I employ a Ben Graham style analysis to assess investment worthiness as we approach a potential recessionary period.With projected capex declines and reduced pension contributions in 2019, there may be light at the end of the tunnel.","When one thinks of the most rapidly growing trends in business today, e-commerce is likely at the top of that list, along with ventures such as the cloud, the app economy, paperless payments, and FinTech. Therefore, in such a rapidly growing industry, it should be a seamless endeavor to spot companies with solid balance sheets, strong revenue growth, high margins, and positive free cash flow.Retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billion USD)Source: Statista.comOne would certainly think that to be the case; however, a few companies in the thick of the e-commerce revolution do their absolute best to argue against what seems to be a very simple, logical investment thesis. Companies such as FedEx (FDX), Amazon (AMZN), and UPS (UPS) conduct their operations at the epicenter of e-commerce, yet they find themselves with barely any cash left over with which to share with their security holders.Source: YCharts.comIn the 1997, Jeff Bezos shared in an interview that while he had been working at a quantitative hedge fund, he learned a startling statistic – that online commerce was growing at 2300% a year. Here is the interesting and entertaining interview found on Alphabet’s YouTube for those interested. What he didn’t tell us at that time was that e-commerce would prove to be an abysmally low margin business for nearly everyone involved.Amazon has been able to lift itself from the doldrums of negligible free cash flow through higher margin ventures, such as AWS, Subscription Services, and Advertising, the result of which can be seen in the chart above. Will FedEx be able to achieve the same divergence from a recent decline in free cash flow through strategic use of their capital? Their most recent 10-Q and Annual Report provide clues, but first, let’s look at the primary reasons FedEx's share price has recently declined.FedEx has a free cash flow issue. There is no sugar coating it. They’ve run a free cash flow deficit for the past two years. In their recent annual report and fiscal year 2019 Q1 10-Q, they were a bit opaque about the source of cash for dividends, so we can only assume that they are presently using debt, which is not a positive development in any sense. Notwithstanding, management may have a solid rational for the present circumstances of their financials as I will share later.Source: YCharts.comWith a new trend of negative free cash flow, one must ask themselves: has the company become inherently flawed with no prospects for generating cash for its security holders? I wouldn’t be so negative; however, when investing in FedEx, investors must take into account the extremely capital intensive nature of the delivery business and the unique strategy management currently employs to capitalize on the growing e-commerce market. Their plight is not unique as I mentioned earlier. XPO Logistics (XPO), UPS, and Amazon all suffer from the razor thin margins associated with the delivery and e-commerce business.FedEx is not shy about disclosing that their business is dramatically impacted by the state of the global economy. But to what extent should investors worry when confronted with the prospect of a global economic slowdown and a company that can’t seem to generate free cash flow as of late?Well, to answer this question, I searched through the annals of investment wisdom for an answer as to how we should assess such a capital intensive business for investment worthiness. Sure, we could check the credit rating, the outlook of which is considered ""stable"" by both S&P and Moody's, but banks that went belly up in 2008-2009 sported healthy credit ratings just a year or two prior.This is where Ben Graham’s approach to assessing capital intensive businesses comes into play. Although by and large an outmoded form of analysis for many industries, especially tech, Mr. Graham employed, as standard operating procedure, an analysis of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, known as the interest coverage ratio. In the 1930s, many of Graham’s securities were highly capital intensive businesses, such as railroad companies. Not by coincidence, FedEx, considered by many to be classified as a “transport”, falls into the same category as railroads even by modern standards.So for our purposes in assessing the worthiness of FedEx, we will take a look at how the company’s ratio of earnings to fixed charges faired during the Great Recession. I am looking at this period so as to ascertain a ""worst-case scenario"", especially in light of the potential economic weakness we face.Source: FedEx's 2010 10-KAccording to Ben Graham, the rule of thumb with capital intensive transports was to always ensure a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of at least 2. While this number is relatively arbitrary and from a different era of investing, we’d like to see a similar level of security for a company today. As can be seen above, even in the absolute depths of the Great Recession, FedEx maintained earnings 1.6x their fixed charges. Today, FedEx carries an interest coverage ratio of 3.0x. Therefore, as we stand on the precipice of a potential recession, we can be certain to a significant degree that FedEx will be able to cover its obligations and avoid bankruptcy filings even during the worst of times.So we've determined that a recession shouldn't deter us from investing in FedEx as the company has demonstrated they are capable of weathering even the worst. With that being said, what should investors pay for a low dividend and slim operating margins?Well, investors have proven their actually willing to pay quite a bit historically. Source: YCharts.comAs can be seen in the chart above, FedEx is trading at a historically low valuation. If I were to include a 10 year chart (I won't because the Great Recession distorts the entire analysis), the current valuation would be even more striking.This leads me to believe that the market has begun to price in a global economic slowdown, and corresponding slowdown in global trade, as the result of central banks transitioning from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening. In this respect, it's up to the individual investor as to what their crystal ball reveals. Indeed, FedEx could trade lower from here, and the present valuation does not perfectly justify investment; however, from another perspective, FedEx trades at historically low levels that have proven to be opportune times to invest. It's no secret that FedEx operates in a rapidly growing industry projected to grow for many years to come, especially as the world globalizes to a greater extent. But this fact alone does not make the company investment worthy as countless have exclaimed regarding investment in Amazon (which i think is investment worthy due to their growing high margin businesses).For a company to be truly investment worthy, it needs to be generating a return sufficient to supply capital to its security holders, i.e. it needs to generate strong free cash flow. And as I've discussed, this is not an area in which FedEx has excelled as of late.Although FedEx's revenues have grown at a CAGR of about 8.29% over the last 5 years, which is phenomenal growth for such a mature company and indicative of a company in a rapidly growing industry, its free cash flow hasn't been strong and has in fact deteriorated. This can be attributed in part to the lower margin, capital intensive business in which FedEx operates.Source: FedEx's Annual Report Fiscal Year 2018As can be seen, the business of shipping and delivery isn't exactly the money printing machine of selling iPhones or Cloud Storage. Nevertheless, the strong, maintainable growth in revenue may create a case for investment when we look at what FedEx does with the 7.6% of profit it does generate from its operations.Source: FedEx's Annual Report Fiscal Year 2018The above chart illustrates that FedEx generated $4.674B in cash from its operations in their fiscal year 2018. They spent $5.663B in capex, resulting in negative free cash flow as I've discussed in previous paragraphs. Obviously this isn't ideal, but for FedEx, it hasn't always been this way. In fact, during much of this 2010's, FedEx has had strong FCF per share.Source: YCharts.comSo what has changed, and what does the future hold?FedEx has been increasing its capex so as to meet the ever growing demand resulting from e-commerce through growth initiatives which account for approximately 30% of current yearly capex. ""We expect approximately 30% of capital expenditures in 2019 to be designated for growth initiatives,"" the company stated in their fiscal year 2018 annual report. The rest of the capex goes towards servicing existing businesses, modernizing fleets of planes and vehicles, and further developing logistics hubs, such as FedEx Express Memphis World Hub. Endeavors such as fleet modernization and shipping hub automation are central to the mission of FedEx currently, and ultimately will result in lower operating costs for the company.In their fiscal year 2018 annual report they stated, ""We are continuing our very successful aircraft fleet modernization strategy. By replacing older aircraft with newer models, such as the Boeing 777F which burns 18 percent less fuel per pound of payload and produces 18 percent fewer emissions compared with the MD-11 it replaces, we save fuel and reduce emissions while enhancing operational flexibility and improving operating margins.""To this end, management shared that they would continue to spend on fleet modernization throughout 2019, an objective that will pay dividends in the future in the form of higher margins.""Our expected capital expenditures for 2019 include $1.9 billion for delivery of aircraft and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. In addition, over multiple years, we will be investing over $1.5 billion to significantly expand the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and over $1 billion to modernize the FedEx Express Memphis World Hub.""Unfortunately for investors, the pain of higher capex is not over, as management projects capex spend to be approximately $5.6 billion in 2019, which is perfectly in line with the prior year's (fiscal year 2018) spend. ""Our capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately $5.6 billion and include FedEx Express investments in aircraft fleet modernization and the Memphis and Indianapolis hub modernization and expansion programs""Fortunately for investors, there is evidence that capex in certain areas is set to decline. ""Capital expenditures at FedEx Ground are expected to decline in 2019, due to the completion of two major hub projects that boost our capacity in the Northeast."" Management continued on to describe the reasons for higher capex in 2018 and 2017, the imperatives of which seem to be judicious uses of the companies operating cash flow with the goal of reducing operating expenses further down the road.Capital Expenditures by Asset TypeSource: FedEx Investor Relations Statistics BookAs we've seen, increasing capex is here to stay for the foreseeable future for FedEx. However, there also has been a decline in cash from operations as of late. I went through their fiscal year 2019 Q1 10-Q to determine what is causing a decline in cash from operations, which is especially odd since their revenues continue to grow at a CAGR of 8.29%.I found that they have been overfunding their employee pension plan resulting in a year over year decline in cash from operations. ""Cash flows from operating activities decreased $256 million in 2018 primarily due to $500 million of additional voluntary pension contributions and $500 million of payments related to previously accrued legal settlements, partially offset by lower net tax payments.""Overfunding the pension plan today will obviously reduce the liability in the future for the company as one would expect, and management divulged as much.""For 2019, we anticipate making voluntary contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans, although at a much lower level than in 2018 or 2017. As noted in our discussion of critical accounting estimates, we do not anticipate contributions to our U.S. Pension Plans will be required for the foreseeable future based on our funded status...""Additionally, the company has incurred costs related to the inclusion of TNT, their recent European acquisition, into their operations. These costs are temporary as they conclude the acquisition process.Therefore, there will certainly be tailwinds on the horizon for FedEx's cash from operations, which obvioulsy play an integral role in the free cash flow equation. In fact, they declared in their 2018 annual report that they expect 2019's cash from operations will cover the entirety of their capex spend for the coming year.When considering FedEx or UPS, an investor must understand that their operations are highly capital intensive. Additionally, investors must consider the implications of being a capital intensive company while operating in an industry in which the companies must spend large sums of money in order to meet rapidly growing demand. With e-commerce growing at a CAGR of approximately 25%, FedEx and its competitors must invest aggressively today in order to prepare for a more profitable future. Thus, buying FedEx, while it grows at a CAGR of 8.92% and while it elevates its spending to meet the growth of e-commerce, may be a wise decision, especially as it becomes very cheap in the coming months due to recession worries. It does, however, require a degree of faith that eventually they will find themselves in such as position as to reduce their capex and begin to generate the free cash flow necessary to make FedEx a worthy investment.I've held shares for many years, and I'm planning to add, as I see their current strategy of planning for the future to be a wise and judicious use of shareholder capital."
4227557,32001,2018-12-10T22:11:07-05:00,"Free cash flow generation is/was the big worry.On a PEG (P/E-to-growth) valuation, the stock is very cheap.The discount to intrinsic value is anywhere from 25% to 33%.The stock is down from $278 in January '18 to $193 this morning.FDX is testing its 200-week moving avg in the low $190s, typically a place to buy with a longer time horizon.","FedEx Corp. (FDX), the transport giant that is now and will always be part of the American lexicon with ""Fedex it overnight,"" is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter financial results on Tuesday, December 18, after the closing bell.Current Street consensus per IBES by Refinitiv is expecting $4.00 in earnings per share on $17.7 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 25% and 9%, respectively, which is pretty respectable growth given the valuation.Let's look at the trends in EPS and revenue estimates:Source: IBES by Refinitiv Street consensus dated 12/9/2018Looking at FDX's P/E relative to its growth rates over the next three years, the stock looks very attractive; but a P/E ratio on a stock in a cyclical business like FedEx can be deceptive. It could imply that forward earnings will decline, particularly with global economic weakness.For cyclical stocks, you typically want to buy when the P/E is at its highest (and earnings are depressed) or at the higher end of the historical valuation range, not the lowest.Fiscal 19's and fiscal 21's EPS estimate revisions have been steadily higher, while FDX's revenue revisions have been steadily higher as well despite the headlines in Europe, Brexit and the worries over the slowing US economy.Source: valuation s/sheet Valuation summary: trading at a 24% discount to the Morningstar fair value estimate and a 33% discount to a $300 fair value estimate (which is derived from a $20 EPS estimate for 2020 times just a 15x multiple = $300) the stock is undervalued from 24% to 30% depending on your estimate and desired multiple.Here is the article on FDX written after the fiscal fourth quarter end August '18 where the stock got hit a little bit on expense accruals, and has fallen further with the latest market correction. (If I'd taken the time to read the conference call notes slower, I'd have found Fred Smith's comments about free cash flow being on the way.)Per IBES by Refinitiv, here is FDX's free-cash-flow estimates for the next 3 years:Source: IBES by Refinitic (current consensus)FDX doesn't pay much of a dividend because its free-cash-flow generation has been so volatile and thin over the years.Here is another calculation - capex as a percentage of cash flow - taken from an internal spreadsheet:Source: valuation s/sheetCapex includes acquisitions like TNT and such but as the reader can see, with FedEx Express having been ""downsized"" over the last 5 years after Express volume remained stagnant for years, and capex having increased, the operating leverage of FDX has increased.For readers who don't understand what operating leverage means, the higher the operating leverage of a business, the greater the change in operating income and earnings per share for a given change in revenue.The above weekly chart of FDX shows the stock nearing its 200-week moving average at $193.61 at Friday's close. It requires patience but buying real business at this long-term moving average can pay off nicely for a longer-term investor rather than a trader.Being as oversold on the weekly chart as it is, FedEx is looking very interesting.Summary/Conclusion: No question the sell-side is watching FedEx's free cash flow closely to meet the fiscal 2019 estimate of $1.97-2 billion, since Q1 2019's free cash flow was ($478) million, and that means the next 3 quarters need to be healthy to meet that $2.0 billion estimate.The bigger threat today, though, might be the slowing in the US and global economy (although that is still up for debate as the ISM Services number was the highest in the last 10 years and the US economy is 80% services.)The 24% to 30% discount to ""fair"" or intrinsic value really depends on whether the US will enter a recession in the next year and whether - given what we know today - that is enough of a discount to warrant an investment at these prices.One client has a $36-37 cost basis on the stock from March of 2000. A big chunk was sold for clients between $150 and $170 a few years ago. (yes, too early...)FedEx's fuel surcharge table showed the charge declining through most of the November '18 quarter but with the speed that crude oil fell in November, I would think FedEx would get some benefit from that decline since ""fuel"" is 4-6% of FDX total revenue the last 5 years.When this note was released by Bank of America on Monday, December 10, 2018, we used the selloff and the -400 morning trade to add some shares of FDX for the first time in a few years. Industrials have been crushed this morning - undoubtedly on China and also what could be the impending ""death of the conglomerate"" given how GE and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have traded.Readers need to know though there is a lot of risk in FedEx:1.) The stock has a high degree of operating leverage given its capex.2.) That's led to a dearth of free cash flow over the last few years.3.) The credit rating is in the BBB area and if FDX can't generate the free cash needed, it will have to issue debt. That likely won't be well-received.4.) Are Air Amazon and the China freight business future competitors for FedEx?Listen for free-cash-flow commentary on the call next week. Any positive guide will be good for the stock, and probably the debt too."
4221263,59101,2018-11-12T09:09:40-05:00,I believe FedEx has reached an inflection point.FedEx is a classical cyclical and will mirror the economy in many respects.I provide Bull and Bear arguments not addressed by SA authors.,"Three of my last four articles have been out of the norm for me. I return in this piece to what might be considered my bread and butter: A Due Diligence Dive.There are a number of perspectives I considered that have not been discussed in the many SA articles I perused during my research. While I provide the action I will take after weighing these Bull/Bear arguments, I trust I will have given you additional information with which to make your own investment decision.FedEx (FDX) has a free cash flow problem, and it has been growing progressively worse. Aside from the obvious concerns that negative FCF brings, the continual deficit has resulted in the company using debt to fund share buybacks and dividend payouts. Take a look at the two charts below.(Via SA contributor Brian Gilmartin CFA)(Via SA contributor Discount Fountain)As my thesis progresses, you will find that I am not particularly concerned about FCF at this juncture. While I hope to provide data that might assuage your concerns, for greater insight regarding this problem, I refer you to a recent article by SA contributor Julian Lin.The company's debt levels have more than tripled in the past five years to $16.5 billion today (it should be noted that roughly $15.2 billion is long-term debt). Meanwhile, FedEx's cash stash has dropped by nearly 20%, from $4.0 billion at the end of FY18 to $3.3 billion at the end of FY19.FedEx's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's are BBB/Baa2. These ratings represent the lower end of investment level debt.While discussing debt, I should add that FedEx has a reasonable pension funding level of 89.5%, an improvement over last year's funding level of 82.8%.FedEx management stated that recently imposed tariffs have cost the company 10% of its business in China. It should be noted, however, that China only provides about 2% of the company's revenues. As this article progresses, I will make the argument that a second front opened by the current administration on Chinese trade could result in a significant net positive for FedEx.A search on this topic reveals numerous headlines from years past in which subpar quarterly results are explained, in part, by increased fuel costs. An investor with an ear to the ground in the oil sector should weigh projected changes in oil prices when considering an investment in FedEx.It is important to note that the company has a fuel surcharge which ranges from 4.75 to 8.5 percent of the total cost of a shipment. Of interest is that negative and/or positive revenue fluctuations lag the actual changes in fuel costs by two months, so be aware of this when weighing quarterly results.FedEx's fleet has an average age of 22 years. Considering it boasts the ninth largest fleet in the world, replacing those aging aircraft represents a huge future capex cost.Where does FedEx rate in relation to commercial airlines? Take a look at the stats below.At first glance, these comparisons are daunting; however, I dug a bit deeper. For example, the US Air Force's fighter fleet's aircraft are an average of 27 years old.Furthermore, older Air Force aircraft have a higher readiness rate. The B-52s, which have an average age of fifty-two years, have a readiness rate of 72 percent. In contrast, the much newer F-22s and CV-22s have readiness rates of 67 and 56 percent, respectively.As I continued my quest, I discovered that Delta embraces the practice of selectively investing in older aircraft rather than increasing capex for newer models. It seems that there are those that believe maintenance costs for older aircraft are a better investment than shelling out enormous sums to update a fleet.There is data that supports this strategy. A recent study by RAND supports that position well, indicating newer aircraft actually require as much or more maintenance as older models. While this seems counterintuitive, the data is convincing.I will readily admit that I tire of writing about the ""Amazon Effect."" It is ironic that I have never held Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, yet I have profited greatly through stocks that have been ""affected.""Want proof? Roughly a year ago, I wrote three articles in rapid succession concerning companies that were considered endangered by Amazon's entry into their space.I doubled my investment in W.W. Grainger (GWW) when Amazon failed to disrupt that enterprise, (yes, I sold at the top). I more than doubled the S&P's gain with my Walgreens (WBA) shares, and I've experienced about a 50% gain with Kroger (KR).Remember how Amazon was going to take over the prescription drug industry while simultaneously decimating Kroger, Walmart (WMT) and a dozen or so other grocers by purchasing Whole Foods?I'm not belittling those that are invested in Amazon. I'm stating that Amazon can't crush every industry represented in the S&P 500 simultaneously.Consider this, Deutsche Post DHL Group (DHL) is the world's largest postal service and international courier service company. Following enormous investments, DHL's US operations lost nearly $1 billion in 2007 alone. After a decade of working to establish a US domestic express delivery service, the company conceded defeat. Has a DHL delivery driver been at your doorstep recently?Recall the fact that FedEx has the ninth largest air fleet in the world? FedEx currently owns well over 400 aircraft and leases hundreds more. Amazon? That company has a fleet of 29 recently purchased aircraft with an average age of 24.1 years.To replicate FedEx's global reach, Amazon would have to be capable of reaching 92% of global GDP in 1-2 business days. Amazon would need to invest in nearly 700 aircraft, 180,000 motorized vehicles and be capable of delivering 14 million shipments per day.Just as Amazon can't topple Kroger or Walgreens without spending many billions in capex and many years of effort, Amazon can't destroy FedEx.Of course, one must consider the possible loss of Amazon as a customer. FedEx's largest client constitutes 3% of sales, and Amazon isn't that customer.Take a look at the two charts below. They answer the question, ""What have you done for me lately?""(Chart: 2018 Roadshow Presentation)The above are graphic illustrations of the dynamic, growing nature of FedEx's business.The company has teamed with Walgreens, Kroger, Walmart, and others to allow customers to pick up and drop off prelabeled packages at retail stores. This means 80% of Americans are now within nine minutes of a FedEx hold location.FedEx recently expanded US ground operations to six days a week. I believe this initiative will improve FedEx's competitive position in the e-commerce market while resulting in minimal additional capex.Changes in corporate tax rates resulted in an estimated $1.1 billion in savings.In 2016 FedEx acquired TNT Express, a Dutch delivery services company. Unfortunately, a massive cyber-attack on TNT's IT system resulted in $300 million in unanticipated costs to FedEx.Integration expenses of $470 million in 2018 are projected to total $450 million in 2019 and should decline to $200 million in 2020. Due in part to TNT, FedEx anticipates an operating income improvement of $1.2 to $1.5 billion in 2020, compared to the current fiscal year.Tricia Griffith, named a director of the logistics company in March, purchased 1,000 FedEx shares for $225.16 each through a living trust on Oct. 17. Totaling $225,156, it marks the largest stock purchase by a FedEx insider on the open market since August 2012.The chart below represents the anticipated growth trajectory of e-commerce through 2022.FedEx is well positioned to benefit from the marked growth in e-commerce. The company currently ranks as the second largest fulfillment company, behind Amazon. Additionally, the FedEx provides services to many of the largest e-commerce fulfillment companies in the US. For example, Red Stag, the fifth largest fulfillment service company relies largely on FedEx for delivery of oversized and heavy products.The Trump administration recently announced the prospective withdrawal of the US from the Universal Postal Union (UPU), an international organization connecting global postal services. Trump's pronouncements on the topic indicate he believes the US is subsidizing Chinese e-commerce by providing postal rates below that offered to US companies.Sixty percent of the lightweight packages covered by the UPU are low-cost items from Chinese companies. In many cases, returning the items to China (those costs are not borne by UPU) results in a fee that is greater than the cost of the merchandise.For example, an item weighing one pound that is shipped from China to the Midwest would cost less than $2. To ship a package of equal weight from Miami to Cincinnati cost $6.70.Of importance to our analysis is that FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) are not eligible for the profit-sharing terminal fees that USPS receives through the UPU.Consequently, both companies have been unable to compete in the last-mile shipping market. Should the administration move ahead with the proposed changes in the UPU, this could provide a lucrative opening for both companies. Furthermore, this would likely increase fulfillment orders in the US as it will result in an increase in business for small US-based e-commerce companies.FedEx possesses a reasonable moat based on network effect, cost advantages, and efficient scale. The company boasts a solid management team. For example, FedEx acquired TNT after the Euro weakened considerably and at a price significantly lower than UPS had offered in its aborted attempt to acquire the same company a year earlier.Argus, CFRA and Morningstar have a fair value for FedEx of $290, $260.51, and $260, respectively.Credit Suisse and Barclays have target prices on the shares at $307 and $310, respectively.My personal assessment determined the company trades at a deep discount when comparing price/book and price/sales and a reasonable discount when considering price to projected earnings and price/cash flow.FedEx has a PEG of 1.52 and a forward PE of 13.18 versus the current PE of 19.54.The company has a current yield of 1.13%. The payout ratio is less than 16%, while the dividend coverage ratio is roughly 630%.The dividend is safe, and I believe it will grow at a high rate for the foreseeable future. The three-year growth rate is nearly 34%, and the ten-year growth rate is nearly 20%.A perusal of my bear arguments indicates I believe FedEx headwinds are manageable. I consider the company a buy for the following reasons.I believe the company will benefit greatly by the expansion of e-commerce.The company has a solid management team and possesses a durable moat.FedEx operates as a duopoly in the US and as an oligopoly on the international level.Although the current yield is lower than I prefer, I believe the company is a strong dividend growth candidate.The company is valued at a level that provides a margin of safety.With the above in mind, I made an initial investment on 11/05/18 for $223.24 per share. I also intend to sell puts for FDX at a strike price yet to be determinedI believe FedEx shares offer a significantly better valuation than UPS stock. I see the fulfillment aspect of the businesses as the primary mover of shares moving forward. Considering FedEx is the number two fulfillment business, while UPS ranks seventh, I believe the former company can take better advantage of upcoming developments in that space.While UPS offers a better yield, that company's payout ratio is much higher. I project similar yields on current cost basis in approximately five years.If you found this article of value, I ask that you follow me by clicking ""follow"" at the top of the page, across from my picture.

4226843,22148,2018-12-06T15:47:22-05:00,FedEx gets hit by Amazon fears every couple of years.The online retail giant isn't even a 3% revenue customer.Analyst estimates shouldn't take a hit from the expected growth of Amazon Air.The stock is too cheap trading at about 10.4x FY20 EPS estimates.,"The time to buy FedEx Corporation (FDX) is when the market gets anxiety over Amazon (AMZN) expanding into the package delivery space. While the large online retailer is always a threat, FedEx should continue riding the delivery economy higher.Image Source: Amazon websiteFedEx along with package delivery competitor United Parcel Service (UPS) traded down about 7% on Tuesday due to fears of Amazon further encroaching into their space. The e-commerce giant has long held the desire of cutting out delivery costs and improve efficiencies in the market so further expansion shouldn't be a shock to the market.The question is why investors sweat these moves as the market gets more competitive for Amazon in the online retail space. Retailers from Walmart (WMT) to Target (TGT) to Walgreens (WBA) are ramping up delivery efforts to become more competitive in a market nearly ceded to Amazon in the previous decade.All of these retailers should provide revenue opportunities for FedEx offsetting any losses from losing business from Amazon. In fact, Walgreens just expanded next-day, prescription delivery with FedEx. In addition, Amazon is more reliant on the USPS for shipping and a Trump-appointed commission recommended raising shipping rates. The bigger direct impact appears to the USPS, if Amazon was to fully build its own delivery network.Morgan Stanley warned (via CNBC) that the growth in Amazon Air would cut the growth rates of FedEx and UPS. Neither company though relies heavily on Amazon for package delivery revenues.On the recent FQ1'19 earnings call, FedEx Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Raj Subramaniam confirmed the limited exposure to Amazon:This question was in relation to the Amazon Delivery Service Partner Network where the online retail giant appears interested in setting up a competing last mile network. All of this competitive news will unsettle the market with signs that Amazon wants to move beyond just improving the delivery of their own products.Also, Mr. Subramaniam went on to suggest on the earnings call that their e-commerce business continues to boom:One saving grace for FedEx is that most retailer companies like the deal with Walgreens won't want to pass their customer information to Amazon to analyze. Also, the company does a lot of priority package and envelope deliveries for businesses that Amazon is unlikely to cover any time soon.Where Amazon ultimately ends up with their delivery network plans is mostly unknown, but Wall St. took the opportunity to sell FedEx before asking questions. The stock has now traded down to $211 on the news and China trade concerns leaving the stock only a few points off the recent 52-week lows. The repeated Amazon threats isn't a reason to sell the stock at the recent lows.Morgan Stanley sees the Amazon Air impact as up to 2% in loss revenues this year and up to 10% over time. Analyst Ravi Shanker had this say about the airplane expansion:One has to be skeptical of how this is actually lost revenue from what the company and analysts had forecast. Going back to 2016, FedEx slumped to $120 due to Amazon fears. The company has aggressively spent over the last couple of years to ensure a superior network to fend off the Amazon threat that may not actually exist with the e-commerce giant mainly focuses on delivering their won packages.Note this USA Today news report back in early March 2016 highlighting the launch of Amazon Air with the leasing of 20 Boeing 767 airplanes. FedEx traded weak heading into that official release of the plans for Amazon to lease planes as the expectation had already leaked into the market. The stock approaching new 52-week lows around $207 just doesn't add up.Knowing that analysts had to have included the Amazon threat into numbers for FY19/FY20 estimates, investors should just relax. The stock now trades at about 10.4x FY20 EPS estimates of $20.16.FDX PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsAnalysts forecast about 14% EPS growth making the current multiple incredibly cheap as the economy increasingly shifts towards relying on last-mile delivery networks.The key investor takeaway is that Amazon doesn't rely heavily on FedEx for the package delivery company to see a big immediate hit from the online retailer shifting delivery efforts. One can never fully know if Amazon has aggressive delivery aspirations beyond their own e-commerce packages where FedEx could ultimately see a hit. Though, most big retailers would avoid ever using Amazon for delivery services.At the current price near $210, the risks to investors are reduced as FedEx has successfully grown earnings in the face of expanding Amazon delivery efforts for a couple of years now. Use this weakness to load up on the stock.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4212512,103321,2018-10-18T14:32:03-04:00,FedEx is a leading multinational courier delivery services company.The company's outlook remains favorable despite a miss in its earnings in its Q1 fiscal 2019.The recent share price pullback has created a good buying opportunity.FedEx has increased its dividend by 30% earlier this year.,"FedEx Corporation's (FDX) Q1 fiscal 2019 EPS was below the consensus forecasts. However, we believe the company's outlook remains favorable due to the following: (1) strong global economic activities, (2) capacity expansion from offering 6 days a week of ground services, and (3) unrealized synergies from its TNT Express acquisition. Its shares are currently trading at a valuation below its historical average. The company has increased its quarterly dividend by 30% earlier this year.FDX data by YChartsLet us first take a look at FedEx's latest quarterly report. In Q1 2019, the company's revenue grew by 11.8% to $17.1 billion (see table below) from $15.3 billion last year. Its adjusted EPS grew by 37.8% to $3.46 per share in Q1 2019 from $2.51 per share in Q1 2018. As we can see, both its top and bottom lines continue to grow at a fast pace. However, its adjusted EPS was below the consensus estimate of $3.82 per share. Its adjusted operating margin also declined slightly to 7% in Q1 2019 from 7.1% in Q1 2018.Q1 Fiscal 2019 Result (Source: Q1 2019 Earnings Release)Favorable economic outlookFedEx should continue to benefit from strong global economic growth in 2018 and 2019. As can be seen from the table below, global GDP growth rate is expected to reach 3.2% and 3.0% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. In the U.S., GDP growth rate is also expected to remain at about 2.9% and 2.6% respectively. These healthy economic growth rates should support FedEx's shipping business favourably.Source: FedEx WebsiteFedEx Ground will operate six days per week in 2019FedEx Ground will begin operating six days a week in the upcoming year. We like this initiative, as it will help FedEx strengthen its competitive position especially in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. In addition, operating six days per week will increase its capacity (adding one extra day of delivery) without adding additional capital expenditures (e.g. no need to purchase new delivery vehicles).Integration of TNT acquisition should continue to improve its operation favourablyFedEx continues to integrate TNT Express into its delivery network (the company announced the acquisition back in 2016). TNT Express has a strong ground network in Europe, Middle East, and Latin America. The integration should improve its global capabilities, profitability, and competitiveness. The company is currently working on integrating the sales team and should complete the sales integration in its fiscal 2019. Although there are still integration expenses, the company expects these expenses to drop considerably after its fiscal 2019. In addition, management expects about $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of operating income improvement in its fiscal 2020 over its fiscal 2017. This is equivalent to about $4.43 ~ $5.50 per share.Exposure to trade tensions between United States and China is lowAlthough trade tensions between the United States and China are worrisome, FedEx does not have a high exposure. In fact, management indicated that FedEx's revenue on the China-U.S. lane, bi-directionally, only represents about 2% of its total revenues. In addition, only a small portion of that 2% is impacted by the tariffs.Share price of FedEx has declined by about 17% since January 2018. As a result, its share price is currently trading at an attractive valuation with a trailing P/E ratio of 12.8x. This is significantly below its 5-year average P/E ratio of 26.5x. Compared to its rival United Parcel Service's (UPS) trailing P/E ratio of 19.5x, FedEx is also trading at a significant discount.Source: Created by author, Morningstar.comFDX data by YChartsFedEx currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of 1.1%. The company has been generous to its shareholders with frequent dividend increases. As can be seen from the chart below, FedEx has recently increased its quarterly dividend by 30% from $0.5 per share.FDX data by YChartsAlthough FedEx's exposure to trade to and from the U.S. and China represents just 2% of its total revenue, a full-scale trade war has the potential to at least slowdown GDP growth rates in these two countries (and potentially other countries as well). We believe a slowdown in economic activities coupled with declining business and consumer confidence will likely result in a reduction in transportation volumes.The company also faces the risk of increasing competition. For example, Amazon (AMZN), one of FedEx's key customers, is also offering shipping services in many markets in the United States. We do not see Amazon as a main threat to FedEx at the moment. However, increasing competition is likely as Amazon gradually expands its network and increases its scale.Although FedEx's Q1 2019 EPS was below consensus estimates, the company's outlook remains favorable. Its shares are currently trading at a significant discount. The company also has a growing dividend. We believe the pullback has created a good buying opportunity for investors with a long-term investment horizon.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4212135,65113,2018-10-17T09:56:30-04:00,FedEx Corporation has seen a drop in price due to fears over earnings and increased competition from Amazon.It is my view that the market is overreacting on these two points.I continue to remain optimistic on prospects for FedEx.,"Back in August, I made the argument that despite being a capital-intensive business, FedEx Corporation (FDX) would continue to see significant upside.At the time of my last article, the stock was trading at $250. However, it would appear the market did not agree with my assertions as the stock has declined to a level of $220 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comUndoubtedly, FedEx has had some issues with free cash flow, with one reader expressing the following:Source: Previous Article on Seeking AlphaClearly, this reader is correct in that while the market may forgive low levels of free cash flow growth due to high capital expenditures, there will inevitably come a point where investors demand FedEx to ""show me the money"".Specifically, we have seen FedEx take a decline due to a missed earnings guidance in September, as well as concerns regarding increased competition from Amazon (AMZN) in the transportation and logistics space.As regards the first point, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act meant that the company accelerated payment increases of $200 million in 2018, which resulted in earnings of $3.46, which was significantly below the $3.78 analyst consensus.That being said, it is noteworthy that diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for Q1 2019 were actually up by nearly 40% from $2.51 to $3.46:Source: FedEx Corporation News Release - 2019 Earnings Per Share OutlookPrimarily, higher volumes and yields, as well as cost savings on fuel and a lower statutory income tax rates, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lifted earnings higher for Q1 2019.Moreover, the ongoing US-China trade war has not had as much of an impact on this company as one might expect. The total revenue to FedEx arising from US-China trade amounts to 2% of the company's overall revenue, with tariffs themselves affecting less than 10% of company volume.In this regard, I take the view that the market is possibly being short-sighted as regards FedEx's performance. Earnings have been showing impressive growth even when considering that EPS did technically miss analyst estimates, and there has been no evidence of a slowdown in this company's sector. It is possible that FedEx might simply be a victim of the broader market downturn that we have been seeing, as investors have become nervous regarding the ongoing trade war and concerns that US equities as a whole might be overvalued.As regards growing competition from Amazon, a significant portion of growth from FedEx has been thanks to e-commerce. For instance, the company has now expanded its services to a six-day week to handle the increased volume growth. Additionally, last year also saw a growth of 2.2% in FedEx Ground volume along with 6.1% increase in revenue per ground package, with a significant growth in residential delivery volume attributed to e-commerce.Specifically, fears regarding Amazon's entry into this market are likely overblown. Amazon poses a greater threat to postal service providers such as the United States Postal Service (USPS), given that it is ultimately domestic business-to-consumer deliveries that Amazon is targeting with this service. With FedEx operating internationally, and business-to-business deliveries accounting for a large portion of overall volume, Amazon is unlikely to pose any significant threat for the foreseeable future.As I mentioned, free cash flow has been falling overall, and capital expenditures have been rising, and this understandably has investors concerned.Source: YChartsHowever, I see the recent growth in volume and earnings as encouraging and do not see a particular threat from Amazon in the grand scheme. Therefore, I take the view that the price of this stock has fallen due to irrational market fear, and the current price could prove to be a valuable entry point for the patient investor."
4212039,32001,2018-10-16T22:02:35-04:00,"The stock is down 17-18% from its January 2018 high.FedEx has had thin free cash flow for years, which has kept the dividend low and not meaningful and the credit ratings just above investment grade.As a classic cyclical stock, FedEx should bounce with the US economy, but will free cash flow ever improve ?","When FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported Q1 '19 financial results in mid-September '18, the stock fell on higher-than-expected variable comp accruals, with earnings per share missing estimates by 10%, and then the stock got hit harder on the pullback in the broader market in the past two weeks.Trading in the mid-$220s this week, the stock is well off its late January '18 $274 high print and is now down 17-18%.The stock is likely due for a nice bounce here, but the longer-term issue is the lack of free cash flow (FCF).Table 1Even on the conference call following the September '18 financial release, Fred Smith was supposed to have said ""the free cash flow is coming,"" although I have yet to find that in the conference call transcripts.Here is the issue with FedEx:1.) FedEx's ""senior unsecured"" credit ratings are BBB/Baa2 from Standard & Poor's and Moody's respectively, which is indicative of the kind of operating and financial leverage. The company has a 47% debt-to-capital ratio, and this is a function of the transport giant's ability to generate FCF.2.) After Enron in the 1990s, which was flagged by one analyst because the company's ""cash flow-to-net income"" began to decay badly, this ratio is run for every company followed, and while FedEx has no issues with cash flow-to-net income other than that it can be volatile and lumpy, it has never had FCF cover net income for any meaningful period.3.) Thin FCF limits dividend payouts and dividend increases. The highest ""free cash flow yield"" I've ever seen FDX sport is from August 2013, and that was 5% - which is pretty good, but it didn't last long.4.) FDX's current dividend yield with the stock trading in the mid-$220s is just 1.18%. With the kind of FCF generation that it has displayed over the years, the dividend will never really be meaningful for investors.Summary / conclusion: I've followed FDX since the mid-1990s, building the valuation model and updating it every quarter since that time, and it's always amazed me how the company trades relative to its FCF generation, which has never been robust, for any extended period of time.That being said, Fred Smith is probably one of the best CEOs in industrial America today, and it's unfortunate that he just happened to start a tremendous business which has very high operating and financial leverage to accompany the business model.The stock is a classic industrial cyclical, and when the US business cycle is humming, as it is today, the stock tends to flourish.Management has a stated goal of improving operating profit by $1.2-1.5 billion by fiscal 2020, less than 4 quarters away, which would be a 25% improvement (midpoint) over the $5.6 billion in operating income generated in fiscal 2018.But will the FCF follow?This is more of a technical article for readers, so please forgive me. Synergies from the TNT acquisition and the planned operating improvement, not to mention a robust US economy, will help the stock.It will be interesting to see if the dearth of FCF will ever be remedied."
4228421,44781,2018-12-14T14:28:17-05:00,"FDX and UPS are both down significant from their 52-week highs.These names have been caught up in the sell-off in the transportation space and I think it's irrational.Both names are producing strong EPS growth, offer great, growing dividends, and multi-year valuation lows.","It’s pretty rare for me to describe an investment decision as a “no-brainer”. Risk is inherent in the equity space and there are no sure things. Disruption is constant in a competitive marketplace and no one has a crystal ball. However, when it comes to long-term growth trends, there are a few that I feel highly certain about. These the trends that I feel comfortable exposing myself to in an overweight manner. One such trend is the long-term growth of the shipping/logistics industry. I feel that the existing large-cap names in this space have wide moats. They’re incredibly profitable and pay reliable, growing dividends to boot. What’s not to like about that situation? This is why I’m so bullish on both FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), long-term.Both of these companies have gone on sale recently. Frankly, this surprises me. One would think that the shipping names would have seasonal strength during the holidays due to the enormous package volumes that they experience during the fourth quarter. Some years there is holiday strength, but not always. This year it appears that the market doesn’t want to touch these names with a 10-foot pole, which is why I’ve been a buyer recently.The way I see it, the retail shift from brick and mortar to eCommerce is far from over. It’s so much simpler to make a few clicks on the internet, avoid the traffic and check out lines, avoid out of stock items, wasted time, etc, when shopping online. The eCommerce players have created a better mouse trap. This is why we’ve seen the traditional brick and mortar names move so rapidly to meet online demand.Those legacy retailers who’ve adapted to the eCommerce atmosphere are surviving (and even thriving in some cases) and those who haven’t are shuttering their doors. And then there are the new entrants into the online shopping space, namely Amazon (AMZN), who have taken massive market share and continue to grow sales at a strong pace. All of these retail companies need to partner with logistics firms to get their goods to their customers in a fast and reliable fashion.This is where the likes of FDX and UPS come in to play. There are the two global leaders in the shipping space. And while I know that there has been talk of disruption and rising competition from upstarts, particularly in the B2C/last mile space, I simply don’t see anyone knocking these two behemoths off their perches anytime soon. It’s not as if FDX and UPS have been resting on their laurels as we’ve entered into the digital age. These companies are integrating technology up and down their operations and it’s making them far more efficient. Also, the capital investments required to gain scale in the logistics space are incredible. Air planes cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There are few companies in the world that could hope to own and/maintain a fleet of planes, trucks, vans, etc, to match FDX or UPS.Sure, Amazon Air might become a thing because shipping costs are a real drag on AMZN’s retail profits, but I also don’t see this as a major headwind for the existing logistics names. AMZN isn’t the only show in town in the eCommerce space and even if it does decide to dedicate massive amounts of capital allocations (which I’m not sure that it will since it is already investing so heavily in the other areas of its business), I highly doubt that AMZN’s retail competitors are going to give an Amazon logistics segment their business. Even if it was the cheapest option out there, funded by profits from AWS or Amazon’s other initiatives, I have to assume that other retail names would rather pay a slight premium to FDX or UPS rather than bolster their competition’s cash coffers.I know the last mile shipping has proven to be difficult with regard to profits, though rising demand is never a bad thing in my book. Right now, it appears that investors believe that FDX and UPS will be forced to eat costs and lower margins to meet demand. Even if this is true, I think it is short-sighted to punish the companies for a problem that most would love to have: too much demand for their services. Analysts are fearing reduced guidance’s from these names as they report Q4 earnings and if this happens to be the case and the stocks sell-off even more than they already have, I think it will present a unique long-term buying opportunity for investors.It’s rare to have companies with such strong market positions and growth prospects selling at steep discounts. Both FDX and UPS are trading with multiples that are far below their long-term historical norms and the market’s premium as a whole.Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs AT $188/share, FedEx shares are trading at 52-week lows, down more than 31% from its 52-week high of $274.66. As you can see above, after all of this weakness, FDX currently trades with an 11.5x ttm P/E multiple. This is the cheapest multiple that has been associated with this stock since the Great Recession. In 2009, FDX’s ttm multiple bottomed out in the 10x range. During more recent sell-offs in 2011 and 2016, FDX shares bottomed out in the 12.5x and 13x ranges, respectively.Frankly put, I see no reason why this company should be trading with a multiple once associated with an economic crisis. Over the long-term, FDX shares have beaten the S&P 500 by a significant margin. You would think th at a high quality company like this would trade at a premium to the broader market; however, the transports have been crushed lately and FDX shares have been caught up in that sell-off. To me, this is a great example of a baby being thrown out with the bath water. While I think it’s possible that a recession is looming over the horizon, the economy still appears to be quite strong. Wages are rising, unemployment is at record lows, inflation is in check, and while I think we’ll see corporate profit growth decelerate next year, that will mainly be due to the comps coming off of tax reform and I still expect to see the broader market’s profits grow in 2019.Furthermore, the average analyst estimates for FDX’s EPS growth for the company’s next two fiscal years remain strong. FDX is expected to post 15% bottom line growth in the upcoming FY2020 and another 12% in FY2021 after that. In other words, this stock is trading with a PEG ratio below 1x.To me, that just doesn’t make sense. This company has a strong history of top and bottom line growth. Although there are some credit concerns, FDX still carries a BBB investment grade credit rating. We’re talking about a $50b company here with global operations and a leading position in an industry with growth tailwinds. And to put a cherry on top of it all, FDX is a great dividend growth company.Sure, FDX only yields 1.4%, but that’s mainly due to strong share appreciation. Since initiating its dividend in 2002, FDX has raised its payment every year. Actually, that’s an understatement. Over this period of time, FDX is one of the strongest dividend growers in the entire market with a dividend growth CAGR of 26.5%. What’s probably most impressive when looking at this company’s dividend growth metrics is that even after all of this double digit annual growth, FDX’s payout ratio remains very conservative, at only 15%. With this in mind, I expect for this company to continue to give investors safe and reliable double digit annual dividend increases for years to come.UPS is not quite as cheap as its rival FDX, though it does offer a much higher dividend yield. UPS is trading for $101/share, which is also a 52-week low. Shares are down more than 25% from their 52-week highs of $135. The recent sell-off has pushed UPS’s ttm P/E ratio down to 14.5x. The last time that this company traded with such a low premium was also during the great recession. In 2009, UPS’s ttm premium bottomed out at ~12.5x. With this in mind, these shares aren’t quite as close to a generational low as FDX’s, but they’re incredibly cheap, all the same.Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs UPS doesn’t offer the same sort of growth prospects that FDX does, though I think it’s 3.5% dividend yield makes up for that. Right now, analysts are expecting to see UPS generate 9% EPS growth next year and another 8% the year after that. This EPS growth should inspire continued strong dividend growth. While UPS did freeze its dividend during the last two recessions, the company managed not to cut it. As you can see on the graphic below, more often than not, UPS gives investors double digit annual dividend growth. Right now, its payout ratio is still fairly low, at ~50%. I expect to see dividend growth be in-line with earnings growth during the foreseeable future. My expectations are for high single digit growth, which still represents a double digit Chowder Number when combined with UPS’s 3.5% yield.To me, this is all fantastic. Give me a $90b company with an A+ Standard and Poor’s credit rating, a 3.5% dividend with double digit dividend growth potential, and I’m drooling over he investment potential.This is why I’ve been adding to my FDX and UPS positions lately. I bought FDX shares last week at $200.15 and then again on Thursday at $187.06. I bought UPS back in late October at $108.82 and then again on Thursday at $100.77. Both of these positions are now slightly overweight in my portfolio. However, because of my long-term bullish outlook, I’d be happy to continue to buy shares into weakness and push that weighting even higher. Should FDX sink to ~$170 and should UPS sink to ~$90, I’ll likely add again.For some more conservative investors, it might be prudent to wait until FDX reports earnings on 12/18 next week to get clarity on the strength of the holiday shipping season and the profit outlook in the industry, but then again, if things are looking bright, you’ll potentially miss out no these bargain barrel prices. I’m happy to stay disciplined to my value principles and buy high quality names like these when I see them trading at undervalued prices.At the end of the day, opportunities like this are why I hold cash. It’s tough to reduce cash exposure in a market like this. Cash can be a comforting asset to hold. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to buy beaten down names in a volatile market, but if I’m not willing to step up to the plate and trust my value screens, then what’s the point of running a self-directed portfolio in the first place?Over the long-term, I wholeheartedly expect to generate strong returns with the shares I’ve purchased at these prices. And, in the meantime, I get to continue to collect strong dividends with reliable dividend growth."
4211557,44781,2018-10-15T06:18:17-04:00,"I believe the market is treating FedEx shares unjustly.This irrational response to what appeared to be fine earnings and news that the USPS was increasing rates is creating an attractive opportunity.FedEx is a wonderful DGI name for those with a long time horizon, and who are willing to wait around for a low yield to really compound and prosper.","The sell-off in the markets during the last couple of days has done a lot of damage to stock prices. With that being said, we’ve been on a major run during the past 2-3 years, and I think it’s fair to say that many equity valuations have grown too high. Some of this pain makes sense, and for long-term investors, it’s fairly easy to stomach before we’re still sitting on huge gains (remember, the major market averages are still only down 5-9% from their recent highs). With that being said, I think there have been some babies thrown out with the bath water. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is one of them. In my opinion, the sell-off of FDX shares has gone too far.First and foremost, let’s take a look at the recent earnings report that started this sell-off in the first place. Going into its ER on September 17th, FDX shares were trading for approximately $255. This was well below the 52-week highs of nearly $275 that the company set in late January during the market run-up at the beginning of the year, but then again, it was also well above the lows of the year (prior to the recent weakness) that it set in late June in the $226 area. FDX was on the upswing throughout July, August, and September until these results were posted, in which higher wages and the U.S./China trade war caused the company to post a significant miss on the bottom line.Early on in the conference call, Raj Subramaniam, FDX’s Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, highlighted the fact that the trade war with China wasn’t helping the company’s business. He noted that the US/China bi-directional lane only represents ~2% of FDX’s global revenues (and tariffs affect only a fraction of those sales at the moment). Yet, he also highlighted the fact that the uncertainties surrounding trade have negatively affected other markets as well and serve as a hindrance to growth.In the Q&A portion of the CC, management did say that they were going to stop giving segment margin outlooks. Any time the market has less information, that’s cause for concern for investors. I imagine that this news was taken as negative, though I’m not necessarily sure that was the case. Management's reasoning was that they’d rather analysts focus on the company’s performance as a whole rather than picking apart individual segments, which is fine by me. Elsewhere in the call, management highlighted its goal to make a $1.2-1.5 billion improvement to the company’s operating income by FY2020, which should be bullish for margins moving forward.Management also noted that while the company is already producing strong cash flows that are increasing, it expects that trend to continue. This will allow FDX to continue to make the necessary investments into its business, as well as return cash to shareholders. Management stated that since FY’14, FDX has bought back 73.1 million shares for ~$11 billion. As you can see in the F.A.S.T. Graph below, FDX has established itself as a strong dividend growth play as well, and management said that it expects for both buybacks and dividends increases to continue.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)With this negative news out of the way, Executive Vice President and CFO Alan Graf got into the numbers, highlighting the company’s $3.46 EPS print (which was well below the analyst estimate of $3.82). Even though FDX’s EPS was $0.36 below the Street’s expectations, $3.46 still represents 38% year-over-year growth. Graf mentioned that $0.50 of this quarter’s EPS came from a lower tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Even with this in mind, the company’s earnings a year ago during this quarter came in at $2.51, meaning that even if we take out the $0.50 attributed to tax reform, FDX still posted growth of EPS growth of 17.9% y/y. Frankly put, you’re never going to hear me complain about ~18% EPS growth (or 38%, for that matter).However, the wider market apparently doesn’t share my sentiment, and FDX shares sold off $20/share, from $255 down to $235. And then came the Jerome Powell’s remarks last week regarding rates, the skyrocketing 10-year yield, and a market spooked about the Fed tightening too far, too fast - and now we find FDX trading down near 52-week lows that it set almost a year ago.Here’s an excerpt of a quick conversation I had with a reader in the comment section of the most recent FDX earnings report. Right after the company reported, shares were down ~2% post market. I never really expected them to fall so far, but I guess that’s why you have price targets figured out ahead of time. As you can see, I was looking at the $220 mark, and here we are. I mentioned this in the comment thread posted above, but as you can see on this F.A.S.T. Graph, FDX is clearly trading at a discount. On a TTM basis, shares have slumped down below 14x earnings. On a forward basis, they’re even cheaper. No, they’re downpriced at the ~10x levels that we saw during the Great Recession, so these aren’t generational lows, but they’re certainly cheap, nonetheless.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)FDX crossed below my price target during the trading session on Thursday, though I didn’t buy because this was day two of the major sell-off and I wanted to let the “3-day rule” play itself out before dipping into my cash position. This is obviously some pretty inexact science, though I’ve seen sell-offs - whether they be in individual names after isolated events or the broader markets during high-volume scares like this - play out within the confines of the 3-day period, and I thought I would be better off safe than sorry, starting to increase exposure to equities too early.It appears that the market stabilized a bit on Friday, which is in line with that 3-day rule thinking. Unfortunately for me, FDX is not trading above my desired target price, so I may have missed out on the deal that I wanted. However, this isn’t to say that the shares aren’t still attractive (especially for those who don’t already have exposure). I have a relatively low target price in place because I already own a full position in FedEx, and it’s going to take a fairly wide margin of safety for me to be interesting in going overweight this name.While FedEx is a leader in its industry, it is a cyclical company. If/when the next global recession hits, business will slow, which will put pressure on the company’s volumes. Over the long term, none of this concerns me, because I strongly believe that global secular trends like globalization, urbanization, and the digitalization of the retail space bode well for a major logistics name like this. With that being said, in the short term, the company’s relatively low yield prohibits me from exposing myself to too many FDX shares, because if a recessions hits in the near future and shares sell off, I won’t be paid much to wait for them to recover. If FDX’s dividend were as high as UPS’s (NYSE:UPS) (in the ~3% range), then I would have no problem whatsoever going overweight this name and making it a core position within my portfolio, even though it is cyclical in nature.But hopefully, the stock doesn’t bounce hard off of the $217 lows it made recently and I have a chance to add to my position at a price that I feel comfortable with (overweight, or not). Only time will tell if last week’s sell-off was a blip on the radar or the start of something greater. Right now, I’m sitting on ~8% cash, and I’ll surely be watching and waiting for attractive prices either way.And finally, I suppose it’s worth most recent headline issues that the company is facing, because this probably played a role (however irrational) in FDX’s most recent decline. Last week, the United States Post Office announced that it would be significantly increasing the rates it charges to ship large/heavy packages. Some fear that this will do damage to FedEx; however, while it may effect margins in the short term, if anything, I find the news bullish for the company long term.Let’s get real: FedEx has been beating the doors off of the U.S. Post Office for years now. Do you really think a USPS price increase is going to change this?More expensive shipping could enable cheaper, nimbler upstart competition to get a foothold/grab market share (especially in an urban environment, where the last mile is crucial). This does add risk to an investment in FDX shares. However, at the end of the day, I have a really hard time imaging a future where the two global leaders in the shipping/logistics space aren’t FedEx and UPS.Another risk is that this move generates competition to FedEx in the form of a much larger and formidable competitor: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Some believe that the USPS’s news was directly aimed at Amazon (especially since the President likes to tweet about how Amazon and Jeff Bezos are taking advantage of the Post Office). Personally, I’ve never really bought into this thesis. If anything, it seems to me that the deal the Post Office signed with Amazon probably saved it, or at least, extended its life before an inevitable demise.It’s no secret that the U.S. Postal Service has subpar management. Its operations are only in existence because it is subsidized by the federal government, and I’m starting to think that in this digital age, there is less and less of a need for this public service. I could easily imagine a future where the mail only comes a day or two a week, allowing those who don’t have access to email to receive important notices, but in all honestly, the internet is so prevalent (and its penetration is ever increasing) that most non-package related shipments are likely going the way of the dodo.There is no doubt that Amazon (and others) need a strong logistics infrastructure. If the USPS price hikes put too much of a hurting on its margins, it will only make sense for it to look elsewhere. Right now, I don’t think the industry has the capacity to meet increased demand, so someone will have to step up to meet it. That could be Amazon itself, which would be bearish for FedEx in the short and long terms; however, the fact that Amazon hasn’t made a deeper dive into logistics (even though shipping costs are a major drain on its quarterly cash flows) leads me to believe that it might not ever so do.Jeff Bezos is incredible smart and brave. He’s probably the most respected CEO in the world, and is a proven innovator with uncanny foresight. And yet, he hasn’t truly stepped up to the plate to compete with the major logistics players. Yes, Amazon has built out air hubs and is working on a delivery service allowing local entrepreneurs to start a business and compete with FedEx/UPS for the last mile, yet to me, this feels a bit half-hearted. Amazon has put its name on the project (known as Amazon Logistics), but ultimately, it feels more like a franchise operation where the onus is on the entrepreneurs rather than the parent company.This is probably a low-cost way to go about building a logistics network. Maybe it’s the smartest way to do so. However, once again, I have a hard time believing that a sort of fragmented network of enterprising individuals will be able to perform better than the well-oiled machine that is FedEx. If Mr. Bezos really thought he could take massive market share, significant reducing Amazon’s shipping costs while turning a profit, I’m sure he would. Since he hasn’t, I have to assume that AMZN’s upper management has decided that the global logistics space is highly complex with barriers to entry that are nearly insurmountable, giving the advantaged to existing powerhouses like FedEx and UPS."

It employs more than 425,000 people and has......which deliver more than 14 million shipments per day!In my initial FDX article, I explained how short-sighted thinking roughly 19 years ago resulted in me sacrificing several thousands of dollars over the long-term for the sake of a quick buck within the short-term.I have subsequently followed up that article with two more FDX articles (here and here), in which I have recommended readers not make the same mistake I made and to focus on this company's long-term growth potential.While I was on my recent vacation which took me through regions with spotty internet access, FDX released its Q1 2019 results. Despite strong results, the investment community knocked its stock price from a $255.73 September 16 closing price to a $241.60 September 17 closing stock price; it has subsequently recovered to $248.33 as I compose this article. Even though FDX raised its full-year profit outlook and Q1 revenue topped expectations, the ~5.5% drop was because the company reported mixed financial results for Q1.In my opinion, long-term investors should not fret too much about quarterly results and earnings projections. A fiscal quarter is pretty much a blink of an eye, and there are a host of factors which can positively/negatively impact short-term results.I know I certainly cannot consistently accurately predict how a company's stock price is going to perform in the short-term. As a result, I focus on how a company has historically performed relative to plan and how the company is executing so as to achieve its mid- and long-term goals and objectives.FDX stands to benefit from the continued growth in e-commerce, including B2B e-commerce, and global trade growth. Its strategic acquisition of TNT (discussed in my March 23, 2017, article) for the purpose of improving ground operations in Europe was expected to be a monumental undertaking, but the cyberattack at TNT certainly complicated and lengthened the time frame in which this integration was expected to be completed.On the Q1 analyst call, FDX indicated:Naturally, the above is based on the assumption of moderate economic growth, stability in global trade, and current accounting rules and tax laws.The following are the macroeconomic projections upon which FDX has based its projected results:Source: FDX - Investor Relations Presentation - September 21, 2018The issue of tariffs will undoubtedly impact FDX to some extent, but management has indicated that only a small portion of its volume coming out of China is expected to be impacted. The overall uncertainty surrounding the tariff issue, however, will have a broader impact on the market, and FDX is continually and carefully monitoring any new developments on the global trade front and is ready to adjust its strategies according to market conditions.In addition to being well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in e-commerce, FDX is also expected to slowly wind down its capital expenditure program. In FY2015-FY2018, CAPEX amounted to ~$4.4B, ~$4.8B, ~$5.1B, and ~$5.7B; the CAPEX projection for FY2019 is ~$5.6B.Couple this CAPEX reduction with the completion of the TNT integration noted above and you get what can potentially be a very profitable FY2020 and FY2021.Naturally, there is always the risk that Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) expansion into FDX's wheelhouse will create some disruption, but I am reasonably confident that FDX's management is spending a considerable amount of time in developing a strategy on how to compete with this new industry participant.On September 17, 2018, FDX released its Q1 results for which a high level snapshot is provided below:Source: FDX - Q1 2019 Earnings Release - September 17, 2018The revised and previously provided EPS and adjusted EPS projections found in FDX's September 17, 2018, earnings release are provided below:Source: FDX - Q1 2019 Earnings Release - September 17, 2018When I made the decision to retire early...that decision was final. After having experienced the pleasure of not having to work for a little over 2 years and to be able to pretty much do what I want to do, and when I want to do it, I see absolutely no reason to risk this by investing in speculative companies.I have absolutely no concerns about the share price of great companies in which I own shares taking a hit. I just don't want to invest in companies where the credit risk is beyond what I would consider reasonable. Being faced with a permanent impairment to a company's share price, or a dividend cut because a company needs to conserve cash, is certainly not something I wish to experience. This is the reason why I like to look at a company's credit ratings.Investing in a company with a ""non-investment grade speculative"" (or worse) rating description is not something that appeals to me regardless of how attractive a dividend yield may be. I pay heed to Moody's and S&P Global's ratings of a company...even though both entities are susceptible to making errors.In the case of FDX, Moody's rates it Baa2 and S&P Global rates it BBB. Both ratings are at the midpoint of the lower medium grade category and are stable. These ratings are acceptable from my perspective.When I wrote my June 20th article, FDX had recently reported $16.79 diluted EPS (GAAP) and $15.31 adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) for FY2018. On the basis of the June 19th closing stock price of ~$258.50, FDX's PE was ~15.4 (the five-year average PE at the time was ~26.9), and its adjusted PE was ~16.89.At the time of that article, the outlook for FY2019 was $15.65-16.25 in diluted EPS and $17.00-17.60 in adjusted diluted EPS. On the basis of a ~$258.50 stock price, FDX's forward PE was ~15.9 to ~16.5 and the adjusted forward PE was ~14.7 to ~15.2.Fast forward to the present day where FDX's stock price is $247.32 as at the close of business on September 21st.Adjusted EPS of $15.85-16.45 before year-end mark to market (MTM) retirement plan accounting adjustments is now expected, thus giving us a forward PE range of ~15 to ~15.6. Adjusted EPS of $17.20-17.80 per diluted share before year-end MTM retirement plan accounting adjustments AND excluding TNT Express integration expenses now gives us a forward PE range of ~14 to ~14.4.I view these levels as attractive to the point where FDX is approaching ""undervalued"" territory.Details on FDX's historical stock splits, stock dividends, and recent stock repurchase programs can be found here, and its dividend history can be found here.Investors have different goals and objectives, and some predominantly, or exclusively, seek investments which will generate cash flow to support their needs. I, therefore, fully understand why some investors will shy away from FDX given that its dividend yield is ~1.05% ($0.65/quarter).Having retired well before I can draw on any pension, I also like the dividend and rental income. I, however, have come to appreciate that chasing dividend yield is fraught with risk. This is why I like to have a portfolio which consists of stocks which provide a steadily growing stream of dividend income and stocks which have lower dividend yields but provide me with the opportunity to generate more significant capital gains.I recognize 20 years is a long time for some of us (especially if being of sound mind and body is a remote possibility if we're still on this planet), but for much younger people than me, you may wish to look at this 20-year graph.Source: TickertechThere are certainly no assurances that FDX will generate similar returns over the next 20 years as it has in the past 20 years, but even if it only performs half as well...that's not so bad.Note: The variance between FDX's return versus that of the S&P 500 is certainly different depending on the time frame selected, so I encourage you to click on the link above so you can select the time frame for which you wish to compare FDX's performance to that of the S&P 500.On the dividend payout ratio front, the $2.60 annual dividend is extremely conservative when compared to FDX's FY2018 diluted EPS of $16.79 and the adjusted diluted EPS forecast reflected in the Valuation section of this article. I view the risk of a dividend cut as being remote.As noted earlier in this article, I was foolish 19 years ago when I bought FDX shares and sold them not long after for a quick profit. That was an expensive lesson in not what to do if you want to become financially free.I periodically read articles in which the company being analyzed is deemed to be an attractive investment, yet the writer does not currently hold a position in said company and also has no intention of taking a position. While there may certainly be an extremely valid reason for this, I still view such a stance as a ""head scratcher"". If I am prepared to recommend a company as an attractive investment opportunity, I am prepared to put my own money on the line.I hold FDX shares in a retirement account for which I do not disclose details and also in the FFJ Portfolio. I also intend to acquire additional shares for the FFJ Portfolio within the next 72 hours. Had I not been on vacation in an area with sporadic internet access when FDX released its Q1 results, I would have acquired shares on the date of the earnings release.Thanks for reading!"
4208879,23179,2018-09-28T11:09:05-04:00,The P/E ratio is an extremely efficient metric that enables business perspective value investors to quickly determine whether they should dig deeper into a stock they are considering.A P/E ratio of 15 as a standard for fair value works for most companies.FAST Graphs analyze out loud review of several prominent well-known stocks in relation to the 15 P/E ratio as a standard valuation reference.,"One of my favorite Warren Buffett quotes is ""investing is most intelligent when it is most businesslike."" The reason this quote resonates so much with me is because I believe it represents the essence of value investing. To me, value investing is about positioning yourself as a shareholder/owner/partner in a wonderful business that you admire and want to partner with long term. In the past, I referred to this as business perspective investing. This is in stark contrast to trading stocks or playing the market.Consequently, business perspective value investors are most concerned with the results the business is generating on their behalf. By this, I mean the revenues (sales), profits (earnings), cash flows, and if any dividend production and growth, etc. In other words, the fundamentals and fundamental value of the business. Therefore, the business perspective value investor's most important question is - how's business? This is in stark contrast to the market player whose most important question is - how is the stock price behaving? In short, the business perspective value investor expects to be rewarded by their businesses operating performance instead of the less reliable and often fickle stock market behavior.Nevertheless, even though most of us are small players investing in mammoth publicly-traded companies, the principles of business ownership still apply. Personally, I believe the realization of the insignificant level of ownership that most individual investors have is what causes them to forget about the principles of business perspective investing and focus more on market action. Many investors find it a huge leap to think of themselves as owners or partners of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), 3M (NYSE:MMM) - or any other large publicly traded company. Yet, in truth and fact, if you buy stock in any of those companies you, as a shareholder, are also a partner and an owner. So, my advice is you should think like one.Business perspective value investors utilize and think about valuation references such as the P/E ratio differently than stock market investors. Consequently, I want to be crystal clear that my following discussion of the P/E ratio is referencing utilizing the metric to ascertain a company's intrinsic value/business value. This is in stark contrast to those who are thinking of P/E ratios as they relate to how the market may be treating a given company.Once again, as I stated in part 1, these are the distinctions that Ben Graham was making with his famous short run voting machine, long run weighing machine metaphor. Market action P/E ratios are all about how people are voting based on a perception of value for a given common stock. Intrinsic value P/E ratios are focused on the weight or substance of the business relative to its fundamentals as described above. Therefore, all my following discussions are based on the weighing machine concept of the P/E ratio.Importantly, this is precisely why valuation is not in the eyes of the beholder. That notion only applies to the voting or market action aspect of P/E ratios. To the business perspective value investor, the P/E ratio (as well as numerous other valuation metrics) are utilized as methods of measuring the intrinsic value of a company based on its production of earnings and cash flows, etc. Stated succinctly, the P/E ratio utilized by the business perspective value investor is simply a mathematical measurement (a thermostat) of what I will call owner's yield. In other words, the P/E ratio is simply indicating the earnings yield that the company's most recent profitability is providing them.Earnings yield is simply the inverse of the P/E ratio. When you divide the company's earnings by its price, the result is the return that all the company's earnings would provide you if they were all to be paid to you. These numbers are what a business perspective value investor sees in their mind's eye when they note a company's P/E ratio. The following table calculates the earnings yield of various P/E ratios:P/E ratio 5 equals earnings yield of 20%P/E ratio of 10 equals earnings yield of 10%*P/E ratio of 15 equals earnings yield of 6.67%P/E ratio of 20 equals earnings yield of 5.00%P/E ratio of 25 equals earnings yield of 4.00 %P/E ratio of 30 equals earnings yield of 3.33%P/E ratio of 35 equals earnings yield of 2.86%P/E ratio of 40 equals earnings yield of 2.5%*the standard for most companiesConsequently, when a business perspective value investor sees a P/E ratio for a certain company, they never attempt to argue about or try to speculate about what it ought to be. Instead, they simply see it for what it is. Therefore, if that P/E ratio represents too low an earnings yield number, they are simply not interested in investing in that company. Also, they are unwilling to commit the necessary time and effort necessary for thoroughly researching the company as well. Moreover, they are focused on what the business can produce over speculating on what an emotionally driven market may or may not produce.At the risk of being redundant, I want to be sure the reader understands what is being posited here. The business perspective value investor, like yours truly, is thinking about investing in a publicly-traded company as if they were buying a private business in its entirety. Consequently, they are attempting to determine whether the business (not the market) provides them an adequate return on their invested capital. The P/E ratio then is a simple barometer or measuring device that allows them to quickly and easily determine if the company's earnings power is compensating them for the risk they are taking.To better understand the important benefit of earnings yield, I developed a ""10-Year Earnings Yield Estimates"" calculator/table to provide economic perspective. Importantly, this calculator is very theoretical and is based on estimating earnings growth over a very aggressive 10-year forward timeframe. Obviously, estimating the future 10 years out is unlikely to be perfectly accurate. However, that is not the point of the exercise or the calculator. Instead, the calculator was designed to compare an equal investment in a company at any given valuation versus investing in a 10-year T-bond. Analysts do provide long-term earnings growth forecasts for stocks that typically equate to 3- to 5-year timeframes. These long-term forecasts are utilized to generate the future earnings yield estimates. Although these are aggressive assumptions, due to the uncertainty of the timeframe, they are often reasonable given the company's historical achievements.To illustrate the importance of earnings yield, I selected two companies with similar historical actual and future estimated earnings growth achievements. The first is Nike (NKE), a company that I admire greatly but that I consider significantly overvalued at a current blended P/E ratio of 33.7. Nike has a May fiscal year-end and based on estimated earnings of $2.34 for fiscal 2018 (note: Nike exceeded estimates by reporting $2.40 actual), their estimated earnings yield for 2018 was 2.8% and their actual came in at 2.97%.Nevertheless, this is an earnings yield that is approximately half of what a prudent business perspective value investor would require - which clearly indicates excessive valuation. Furthermore, note that based on an aggressive forecast earnings growth rate (EPG Gr) of 14.1%, Nike's future earnings yield would only be 10% in fiscal year 2027, if, in fact, it were to achieve that lofty rate of growth. This is not adequate compensation for the risk of investing in Nike today - in my humble opinion.In contrast, let's look at FedEx Corporation (FDX) and evaluate its future potential earnings yield in comparison. Both companies possess similar characteristics of historical growth and future growth. Moreover, they have similar fundamental attributes relating to their debt levels. FedEx is lower rated than Nike but much more attractively valued at a blended P/E ratio of 15.1. Furthermore, FedEx also has a May fiscal year-end which facilitates the comparison even more.2018 consensus estimates for FedEx were $15.12. However, like Nike, they came in higher at $15.31. Based on the estimate as shown in the table, FedEx's earnings yield would have been 6.3%. However, it came in at 6.62% based on current price and current P/E ratio. But most importantly, note that by fiscal year 2027, the earnings yield for FedEx is estimated to grow to 18.9% - which is significantly higher than the 10.1% forecast for Nike.Furthermore, this begs the question what level of earnings power (earnings yield) should a prudent investor be willing to accept or expect on their invested capital? In this regard, it is useful to recognize what rate of return stocks have historically delivered. For most of my career, which started in 1970, that number has been a 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). More recently, thanks to our current long-running bull market, that number calculates closer to a 9% to 10% range. Nevertheless, I continue to consider the 6% to 8% expectation reasonable and/or conservative. For those who would like to see more granularity on historical stock market returns, I offer the following link to a stock market returns calculator courtesy of moneychimp.Clearly, and it is no coincidence, this return expectation closely coincides with the 6.67% earnings yield that a 15 P/E ratio calculates to. However, this would also suggest that P/E ratios lower than 15 would calculate at a higher earnings yield, and therefore, be even more attractive - and vice versa. With this in mind, my personal approach has been to look for companies that are currently available at P/E ratios of 15 or lower, and the lower the better. This doesn't mean I will automatically invest in them, it simply suggests that I consider them worthy of conducting a more comprehensive research effort.However, it should also be understood that these are guidelines and not absolutes. Moreover, later I will discuss why and under what conditions I would be willing to invest in a stock at a P/E ratio higher than 15. This is not a one-size-fits-all situation; however, it is a normal or average size that applies to most companies based on the logic presented above.Nevertheless, with all of this under consideration, the 15 P/E ratio has been a stock market standard historically for many years. However, you can also think of a fair valuation range of P/E ratios for the stock market of perhaps 13 to 17. Once again, the lower the better. Additionally, FAST Graphs the fundamentals analyzer stock research tool applies fair valuation P/E ratios to companies driven by their earnings growth rate achievements. After studying literally thousands of companies, it has become quite clear that a 15 P/E ratio correlates very closely with the long-term movement of stock prices for most, but not all companies.For example, I offer the following graph on FedEx Corporation whose future earnings yield estimates I cited above. The orange line on the graph represents a P/E ratio of 15 going back to fiscal year 1999. Importantly, this is not theoretical, this is real world actual historical realities and results.Note how the black monthly closing stock price line tracks the orange P/E ratio line of 15. Of course, it is not a perfect fit; however, every time the price deviates from the 15 P/E ratio notice how it inevitably moves back into alignment. This also illustrates the difference between market value and intrinsic value.Everything I've written about so far relates to the current P/E ratio as a quick fair valuation indicator. However, there are also adjustments that can be applied when evaluating historical P/E ratios and adjustments that can be applied when evaluating future P/E ratios. Therefore, it might be helpful to share various definitions of the P/E ratio that I have presented in previous articles as follows:The P/E Ratio - Definitions:The P/E Ratio can be defined in several ways, with each definition adding insight to its significance. The simplest definition is simply the price of the common stock divided by its earnings per share. This is a basic mathematical definition expressed as follows: PRICE/Earnings = P/E Ratio.A second commonly used definition is: The P/E Ratio is the price you pay to buy $1.00 worth of a company's earnings or profits. For example, if a company's stock has a P/E Ratio of 10, then you must pay $10 for every dollar's worth of that company's earnings or profits you buy. If its P/E Ratio is 20, then you pay $20 for every dollar's worth of that company's earnings or profits, and so on.It is important to note, however, that a higher P/E Ratio does not necessarily mean that the company has a higher valuation or that it is more expensive than a company with a lower P/E Ratio. This fact is not understood by many investors and is the key reason that the P/E Ratio has little value by itself or if used in a vacuum. It is theoretically possible, depending on each company's future prospects, that a company with a P/E Ratio of 10, for example, can be significantly more expensive than a company with a P/E Ratio of 40. I will elaborate on this important point later.A third definition would be: How many years in advance you are paying for this year's earnings. For example, if a company has a P/E Ratio of 20, then you are paying 20 times this year's earnings. If the P/E Ratio is 10, you are paying 10 times this year's earnings, and so on. This definition by virtue of adding the element of time illustrates a simple premise of what a prudent investor thinks an operating business is worth.To illustrate the relevance of the P/E ratio of 15 as fair value for most companies, I offer the following analogy based on the earnings of a private business. If you had a private business that was netting you $100,000 net, net, net after all expenses and taxes, it is unlikely that you would sell it to me for $100,000, or a P/E Ratio of 1.A business that generates an annual revenue stream for its owner has a value greater than one year's profits. This is true even if the company is not growing or not growing very fast. For example, let's assume that the above private company does not grow, but that it does pay a consistent $100,000 per year of net income (hint: like a bond). If the owner sold it for one times earnings ($100,000) he or she would essentially have no money coming in after the end of the first year.So this raises the question, what value should an owner place on a business they are desirous of selling? The optimum value would be to sell the business for a price where the net proceeds could be invested to generate a comparable income stream.Note: since this is being offered as a theoretical mathematical exercise, I will assume no taxes or other costs associated with a sale. Therefore, for illustration purposes, let's assume the owner could purchase a treasury bond paying a reasonable 6.67% return with the proceeds from the sale of the business. Therefore, the owner would need approximately $1,500,000 net after taxes earning 6.67% ($1,500,000 x 6.67% equals $100,050) in order to replace the $100,000 per year they were receiving from their business. In other words, this valuation represents a P/E ratio of 15.From the purchaser's perspective, if they paid $1,500,000 for the example business (the P/E ratio of 15), he or she, in turn, would be receiving a current earnings yield of 6.67%. Earnings yield (E/P) is the inverse of the P/E ratio. Since the average rate of return from common stocks has ranged between 6% - 10 % historically, a 6.67% expected current return might be considered reasonable by both the seller and buyer. If this were true, then this transaction theoretically benefits both buyer and seller and could be consummated.This exercise establishes the P/E ratio of 15 as a baseline or rational valuation level from both a buyer's and a seller's perspective. This does not suggest that it is a perfect calculation of fair value, intrinsic value or true worth. Instead, a P/E ratio of 15 represents a sound valuation level that a business generating an income stream is worth, even if the business isn't growing. However, this valuation level is only relevant if the business is generating a positive level of earnings. Therefore, I suggest that the reader might consider a P/E ratio of 15 as a benchmark for a sound valuation reference for average growing companies.Moreover, a P/E ratio of 15 as a sound valuation reference is useful for most companies when their earnings growth is 15% or less. There are many investors that find this last statement either illogical or hard to accept. However, in my experience analyzing thousands of companies over many decades, the 15 P/E ratio as a valuation reference is fully supported in real-world circumstances. In my opinion, this speaks loudly to my earlier point that the P/E ratio cannot be utilized in a vacuum. Furthermore, a sound valuation does not in itself guarantee a high level of future returns.To ascertain future return potential, I believe the P/E ratio needs to be evaluated in relation to the earnings growth potential of the company in question. A 15 P/E ratio represents soundness based on the earnings yield it represents, as illustrated in my private company example above. However, it is the P/E ratio in relation to the company's earnings growth rate that will produce future capital appreciation and dividend income growth, if a company pays a dividend. Furthermore, this fair value P/E ratio applies to earnings growth up to 15% per annum. However, at 15% or greater growth is where the power of compounding kicks in. For companies growing this fast, the P/E ratio equal to the company's earnings growth rate becomes more relevant than the simple 15 P/E ratio.Sound valuation is primarily a measurement of risk associated with making a purchase of a common stock. However, from a total return point of view, it is a relative metric that is best evaluated in conjunction with earnings growth.Nevertheless, the proof is in the pudding as they say. Therefore, I offer the following F.A.S.T. Graphs™ analyze out loud video where I review several prominent well-known stocks in relation to the 15 P/E ratio as a standard valuation reference. I will start out with the S&P 500, followed by several companies with various earnings growth rates. The company examples are offered in order of lowest earnings growth rates to highest. Moreover, I will show that companies that have higher earnings growth rates of say 20%, 30% or better will command P/E ratios that are higher than 15 but equal to the earnings growth rates. The video will show some examples.I want to be clear that I do not believe that the P/E ratio is the go-to or only fundamental metric that investors can utilize to determine fair valuation. Instead, it is one of many that I will evaluate and utilize as part of a more comprehensive research and due diligence process. However, with that said, I do believe the P/E ratio is an extremely efficient metric that enables business perspective value investors to quickly determine whether they should even waste their time digging deeper into a stock they are considering. In short, I look to the P/E ratio to help me quickly decide whether a stock is research worthy or not.Moreover, as stated in the article and supported in the video, valuation metrics serve as barometers or thermostats of relative valuation levels. For example, if I see a stock trading at an excessive P/E ratio, I immediately recognize that it's highly unlikely that it is a great value or valuation play. Instead, I almost immediately understand that the market is likely appreciating the stock more than I do or would. This is true even if it's a company that I consider of utmost quality and one that I would be very desirous of investing in if I could get it at a prudent valuation.Finally, as I illustrated in the video and described in the written portion of this article, a P/E ratio of 15 as a standard for fair value works for most companies. It's not perfect, nor should you expect it to be. Instead, it is merely an excellent barometer that empowers you to efficiently make quick decisions on investments you should research further or skip. It is not the end-all, it is only the beginning of a more comprehensive research and due diligence effort."
4206989,22148,2018-09-18T14:16:54-04:00,FedEx dipped following FQ1 results missed EPS targets.The stock has traded around the $250 level all year.The package delivery company continues to hike yearly EPS estimates despite the lagging stock price.The stock only trades at 12x next year EPS estimates while the business benefits from the delivery economy.,"Over the course of the last 9 months, the market is clearly moving towards a delivery economy where existing delivery networks have high value. FedEx (FDX) remains a premier package delivery service that has shaken off the Amazon (AMZN) fears as the opportunities move far beyond simple packages.Image Source: FedEx websiteThe stock is down slightly more than $5 to below $250 following FQ1 results that missed analyst estimates by a wide $0.36 margin by earning only $3.46 per share. FedEx gave some mixed messages about the higher costs for wage increases following the tax cuts while guiding up the rest of the year. The $170 million in additional costs did have a $0.48 negative impact on earnings.My previous investment thesis on FedEx last December was mixed as the stock originally approached $250 following an incredible $100 rally in the prior 18 months. The stock has traded around this level for all of 2018.The package delivery company guided up on EPS estimates for the year to $17.50 following incredible hikes over the 9-month period where my theory was not so bullish. The lengthy consolidation period combined with the EPS hike changes the valuation story. My previous article had FedEx making only $15.14 in the next fiscal year while the analyst estimates are up at an incredible $20.12 now.FDX EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThis number doesn't even factor in that FedEx just hiked the current year EPS estimate to about $0.12 above the analysts'.The biggest fear for FedEx was that Amazon was going to snap up all of the retail e-commerce market, leaving FedEx facing customer loses. The reality is that as retail competitors become more aggressive, they need a delivery partner to stay competitive with Amazon.Businesses from grocery to restaurants to furniture are looking for ways to deliver goods in a timely manner. The package delivery firms have the networks to efficiently incorporate some of the delivery economy options into their network.The company recently announced the expansion of ground delivery to six days per week year-round to meet the needs of the modern e-commerce market. FedEx forecast the increased efficiency of using facilities another day each week will generate higher margins in the process as capacity is expanded without the need to spend more capital.Remember that a lot delivery services are struggling to find drivers, and FedEx along with United Parcel Service (UPS) already have highly paid, trained work forces driving by the majority of houses in the country. For this reason, the package delivery companies have a path to long-term growth with last mile delivery that is unmatched outside the U.S. Postal Service.This growth opportunity is a prime reason that FedEx should no longer trade below $250 and is far too cheap at 12x forward EPS estimates. It is rare to find a stock plugged into the new economy that is trading below the 15% EPS growth rate of the company.FDX PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that FedEx becomes a bargain below $250. The stock has oddly failed to rally in the face of higher EPS estimates this year as the stock originally had a stretched valuation last December. The long consolidation phase has left FedEx a more appealing stock for new investors now.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4207008,43041,2018-09-18T15:19:38-04:00,"FDX had an earnings miss to expectations, with strong revenue growth.The company brushed off this miss, blaming it on accelerated wage increases and increased variable compensation.FDX actually increased full-year EPS guidance, yet the stock sold off over 4% to $244 or so by mid-day.I report herein on the company's case that it is operationally superior and poised to deliver strong results for years to come.Finding this argument persuasive, I have added more FDX in the $240s, believing that it does not deserve to trade at a discount to the market.","On June 29, I wrote my first article on FedEx (FDX). FDX was at $227, down from its January high near $275, but its business was operating well and there was light at the end of the costly TNT Express integration and IT system remediation efforts. In addition, fuel costs had spiked and there was widespread talk of crude oil surging back to $100/barrel; I thought this had contributed to a good buy-in point for FDX (and other airlines, a sector I trade regularly without long-term ownership plans).Now, following Monday's Q1 earnings release and earnings call, the stock has backed off from its recent recovery high around $260 and is trading around $244 as I submit this follow-up article. The point of view of this article remains the same, which is that FDX appears to be on a steady course to deliver alpha on a multi-year basis, so that investors again may have a chance, right now, to enter with a reasonable expectation of being rewarded with a performance better than that of the S&P 500 (SPY). The 10-Q has been released; I appreciate companies that release quarterly earnings and the 'Q' on the same day.Here is the 5-year comparison as of Monday's closing prices; UPS (UPS) is also shown:FDX data by YChartsClearly, the higher dividend yields of both UPS and the SPY did not make up for the weaker price performance of these names.I continue to believe that while both UPS and the SPY are very good assets, FDX is a cream-of-the-crop one. Here are some updated points that support this view.Revenues rose 11.3% yoy to $17.05 B. Pre-tax income rose 12.1% to $1.10 B. After-tax income and EPS comparisons are greatly skewed by the income tax reductions in this Q1 versus last year. Diluted EPS were $3.10, and the dividend payout has risen 30% yoy and finally (barely) exceeds 1%. TNT integration costs were actually heavier this period than last year. Profit margins were basically stable.Founder and chairman Fred Smith noted in the press release:The Street did not love the number, even though FDX insisted that the one-time factors of higher costs from variable compensation and an early pay raise due to the tax cut accounted for a miss to expectations.Given that part of the post-earnings release sell-off was driven by the coincidence that the release came simultaneous to the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs on imports from China, it's important to remember that FDX is heavily a North American company with major operations in the EU and globally. US-China trade is very small as a percentage of its revenue base, and if production is shifted from China elsewhere, including within the US, there will still be a similar amount of physical goods to be moved. In addition, FDX is a growing services/logistics provider, and if companies are going to source less from China and more from different parts of Asia or South America, for example, then they may need FDX to advise them on the relevant factors for trading with unfamiliar regions. In any case, strength in the US economy is the largest single driver of the results for FDX, HQ'ed centrally in the US in Memphis, Tennessee.The press release notes that operating income was aided by:The quarter looked fine to yours truly. In addition...The company guides using GAAP with the exception of mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments, which it cannot forecast. It also makes projections both including and excluding the ongoing costs of integrating TNT into the larger FDX network. Without breaking out the TNT costs, and excluding MTM pension adjustments, FDX made the following projection for FY 2019:Breaking out TNT's ongoing integration costs, these are the comparisons:So, despite a $0.35 EPS miss to Street expectations in Q1, EPS guidance for the full year was increased by $0.20.Thus, knowing the tariff situation, FDX is seeing a continuation of what I think was really a strong Q1.In addition, though I don't put a lot of stock in longer term projections, FDX continues to say it remains:All this looks very strong, yet even if one includes the TNT integration expenses in projected EPS, FDX at $244 is trading at about 15X current-year EPS, about a 15% discount to that of the SPY when comparing GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS.Yet as a core part of the modern US and global economy and one of a very small number of major shipping companies, I think that FDX deserves an above-market multiple. If one assumes that the special TNT costs are transitory, as they should end by FY 2020, then FDX is at 14X FY 2019 EPS, which is quite cheap for a dominant player in this market.Better yet...Many FDX followers worry about Amazon (AMZN), noting the tremendous efficiency of its warehouse operations, but FDX states in the conference call that it believes it is totally state-of-the-art in its operations:That's impressive. In response to a separate question about AMZN, FDX had this to say (lightly edited):One reason I have preferred FDX over UPS is that FDX is winding down a large capital investment program, whereas UPS has said it needs to increase this sort of spending to keep up. In addition, by about the end of calendar 2019, FDX should be more or less finished with the large integration costs of TNT.So I see FDX as a secure player in a large and growing, but still not fully consolidated, global industry.But it's large enough that...While there has been internal growth, FDX has been a roll-up, coming at the incumbent, old-line UPS first with the innovative, now-traditional FedEx ""air force"" and now in all ways. The roll-up aspect has gone well, as has the capital expenditure/technology effort, but it has been at the cost of depression of GAAP EPS and a minimal dividend payout. It may now be the case that FDX has reached the global scale it requires to grow more like an Apple (AAPL) or AMZN, with bolt-on acquisitions that are win-win for both FDX and the acquired company. This may mean that the large dividend increase is the beginning of a trend and that FDX may begin to reap the fruits of the operating margin expansion that the analysts keep waiting for - and punishing FDX for not achieving yet. Different analysts, in a different sector, have of course been very forgiving of AMZN ""getting there."" So it goes, but it's possible that FDX could be near the stage where EPS can grow faster than sales, and its relative P/E may also expand: the classic ""twofer"" for investors in a stock.I view FDX as an average-risk stock within the class of stocks with market caps above $50 B. It's certainly sensitive to the economy in a way, and sharp increases in fuel costs will affect either its margins or volumes. Please see its 10-K and other regulatory filings for its presentation of risk factors involved in ownership of the shares.Stocks, and markets, move in inscrutable ways. I've been around the markets for over half a century and an active participant for nearly 40 years. I have yet to figure out a reliable way of discerning if a stock that sells off as FDX just did on pretty good numbers and that has raised guidance is more of a buy or less of one than it was a day ago. In any case, on the history of FDX being a successful enterprise and a resilient company with an up-trending stock over the years, I was comfortable buying some more shares on the dip. Intra-US and global trade will continue, and the proportion emanating from China to the US will do what it does. Over time, I favor investing in leading industry consolidators, especially ones such as FDX that have been investing heavily both in expanding their global footprint and in making their operations increasingly efficient. At a below-market forward multiple, FDX strikes me as a strong buy-and-hold stock. My goal is low double-digit long-term capital gains, stemming mostly from EPS growth, and secondarily from possible absolute P/E expansion. I do expect relative P/E expansion, but the market P/E could shrink. I also expect some contribution from dividend growth, but at a 1% yield, it likely will take a long time for that to be a major part of the FDX bull thesis.It will be interesting to look back in two years, with the TNT Express integration largely complete, and see what the ongoing earnings power of FDX is at that time, and what absolute and relative P/E the mythical Mr. Market gives it.Thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you wish to share on FDX and its sector."
4201169,65113,2018-08-22T09:01:39-04:00,"FedEx Corporation has seen significant growth in earnings over the past two years.This has been due to significant growth in the global freight market.While future growth trends for the freight market are somewhat uncertain, I continue to take a bullish view on this stock.","Back in late 2016, I made the argument that due to low growth in earnings and free cash flow at the time, FedEx Corporation (FDX) would see little upside from a price of $158.It’s clear I made a wrong call on this one – the stock is up to a price of $250 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comAt the time, the TNT acquisition had a significant impact on cash flow due to the capital outlay required for the same.When we look at the company’s earnings and free cash flow growth trajectory since 2016, we see that earnings on a normalized diluted basis are up significantly, while free cash flow growth has dipped into negative territory:EPSSource: ycharts.comFree Cash FlowSource: ycharts.comOn the basis of the above, it is clear that the market is prioritizing growth in earnings while ignoring the decline in free cash flow growth.That said, the industry that FedEx operates in is highly capital intensive, so it stands to reason that higher capital expenditures would have a negative impact on free cash flow growth.For instance, we see that competitor United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) has also seen a significant dip in free cash flow, while capital expenditures for both companies have continued to rise:Capital ExpendituresSource: ycharts.comFree Cash FlowSource: ycharts.comTaking this into account, I do not see negative free cash flow as necessarily being an impediment to investing in FedEx, particularly given the growth the stock has demonstrated in the past two years.When examining the company’s most recent earnings report, adjusted EPS of $15.31 marked a 27% YOY increase, and three out of four FedEx segments showing double-digit revenue growth, with Ground up 12%, Express International Export up 10%, Freight up 16%, and U.S. Domestic up by 4%.In this regard, strong performance internationally and continued revival in the freight sector have seen earnings go significantly higher.Notably, while capital expenditures have been increasing as a whole, the ratio of capital expenditures to revenue has actually decreased significantly since 2016:Source: ycharts.comLooking forward, what are the risks for this company? While Freight has been the company’s best-performing sector, there is still a significant risk of a slowdown for this segment. While demand as measured in freight ton kilometers increased by 2.7 percent in June 2018, a slowdown in world trade could have significant ramifications, as higher tariffs deter import and export growth, and hence, demand for freight services.Moreover, with Asia accounting for nearly 37 percent of the overall freight market globally, a fall in growth to 1.1 percent marks a 17-month low for the region and might be a risk factor going forward.With that being said, the global freight market did grow by 8% in 2017 – which marks the biggest annual gain since 2010. Therefore, it is possible that the freight market could continue uninterrupted growth should fears regarding trade fail to materialize, and FedEx could see significant upside as a result.From a valuation perspective, FedEx trades at a significantly lower P/E ratio of 14.93x versus a ratio of over 28x that the company saw at the beginning of 2017. This, coupled with strong earnings growth during that period, indicates that an investor would still be getting in at a good price even if freight demand remains uncertain going forward.To conclude, I misjudged FedEx last time around by focusing overly on free cash flow. Capital expenditures as a proportion of overall revenue have been decreasing, and earnings growth has continued to rise. While the freight market’s immediate future is somewhat uncertain, I still take a bullish view on this stock.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4210274,103711,2018-10-09T08:30:10-04:00,"FDX is capitalizing on the increasing demand for package deliveries as a result of the rise of e-commerce.With shares trading just above 13.5 times forward earnings, shares appear to be materially underpriced.Their cash flow statement shows that share repurchases and dividends have been funded by debt.Debt has more than tripled in the past five years to a recent $15.2 billion.While the high leverage is something to watch out for in the future, shares are still a strong buy.","FedEx (FDX) is a well known company which is poised to benefit tremendously from the continued rise of e-commerce. Shares have languished year to date, causing the valuation to appear cheap compared to historical multiples. While the thesis on a high level remains intact, a close analysis of their cash flow statement raises potential red flags as in spite of a very significant capital return program through dividends and share repurchases, free cash flow appears elusive. I explain why in spite of this, I am still long the stock and, in fact, rate shares a strong buy.FDX has performed poorly year to date, and while it has still performed well in the past twelve-month period, this underperformance relative to historical standards has led its price to earnings multiple to see a significant compression:At first glance, the decision whether to “buy the dip” appears like a foregone conclusion. According to Statista, the e-commerce market in the U.S. has been growing steadily and is projected to continue seeing strong growth moving forward:This in turn should lead to heightened demand for package delivery services, especially those provided by FDX. FDX has benefitted squarely from this increase in demand, seeing very strong earnings per share growth:(2018 Roadshow Presentation)This appears to also be due to the fact that within this industry strong tailwinds, FDX is best of breed and continues to take market share:(2018 Roadshow Presentation)This all appears to just be a slam dunk, but before we conclude that this is a buy (as I will later), we should not forget to do a careful analysis of the financial statements.FDX has rewarded shareholders with a rapidly growing dividend (per share):(Chart by author, data from FedEx Investor Relations)When compared to earnings, these look fully covered:(Chart by Author, data from 10-K)Dividends and share repurchases are, however, capital return options which are typically paid out of free cash flow, which adjusts for capital spending. When we try to calculate free cash flow, we can see that it falls far short of the combined dividend and share repurchase payouts:(Chart by Author, data from 10-K)In fact, as we can see above, free cash flow is actually negative the past two years (and that’s before the dividends and share repurchases). What is going on, and is this a cause for concern?It turns out that I was not the only one confused by the numbers. On the FY 2019 first quarter conference call, Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank asked,Note that the analyst is implying that FDX is not currently generating free cash flow.Management responded, saying:Unfortunately, however, management did not give any reconciliation for how to compute the exact free cash flow metrics, neither in their reports nor on the earnings call. Investor Relations did not respond to my request for comments.When computing free cash flow, we need to make a distinction for “recurring” versus “growth” capital expenditures. Recurring capital expenditures are those which should be expected to be done every year and can also be thought of as maintenance. Growth capital expenditures, in contrast, are not necessary to maintain the business and should be revenue-enhancing. It is the maintenance expenditures which should be subtracted from cash flow from operations to arrive at free cash flow.We can see a breakdown of how their capital spending is being allocated below:(2018 Annual Report)Because management does not disclose exactly which segments are growth versus recurring, we thus cannot know for certain how to classify each segment. From a quick glance, I would presume that their aircraft expenditures, which make up by far the largest component of total capital spending, is most likely to be classified as growth and non-recurring due to FDX needing to rapidly scale their Express segment.Considering that FDX is also seeing rapidly rising earnings, it does make sense to trust management’s word that much of the capital expenditures are non-recurring and that they are indeed generating free cash flow (though I need to reiterate that more clear disclosure would not hurt anybody). This, however, still begs the question: how are they affording to pay out dividends and repurchase so many shares if they are nonetheless cash flow negative after capital spending?As we can see below, FDX has bridged the gap between free cash flow and shareholder returns using debt:(Chart by author, data from 10-K, 2016 debt figure adjusted for acquisition)Long-term debt has swelled from $4.7 billion in 2014 to $15.2 billion this year.I suspect many readers may be raising eyebrows and wondering: is this sustainable? Isn’t all debt bad? Here’s how it works: whereas technically FDX indeed has been cash flow negative, their debt to EBITDA multiple has remained in the 1.9-2.0 range the past four years, meaning that in spite of issuing quite a bit of debt, they have nonetheless remained leverage neutral.It appears that FDX is able to get away with such high leverage due to their business being perceived as consumer defensive with highly recurring revenues. This is shown by the fact that FDX has a low weighted average interest rate on debt of 3.6%. As we can see below, FDX has staggered the maturities so that near-term maturities are small and relatively easy to refinance:(2018 Annual Report)FDX indicates in their annual report that their revolving credit facility restricts them to a leverage ratio no more than 3.5 times - I, however, do not believe they will purposefully go over their current 2 times ratio. It is nonetheless still surprising to see such an aggressive share repurchase program which is clearly being funded by debt with the expectation of maintaining the same leverage ratio.Management has guided for $5.6 billion in capital spending for FY 2019. Management has also guided for $17.50 earnings per share for FY 2019, which based on 272 million shares outstanding suggests roughly $4.8 billion in cash from operations, as cash from operations has typically closely followed net income. This suggests that capital spending will continue to outpace cash flow in the near future, and further that FDX will continue to fund their return of cash to shareholders through debt issuance. While I do believe that capital spending will remain elevated for the near to mid term due to FDX needing to position themselves to meet rising demand, should they ever come to a point where no further scale is needed through capital spending, then FDX would suddenly have a large influx of cash flow that could be used to further accelerate share repurchases and growing dividends. While FDX is potentially walking on a tight rope by intentionally maintaining a 2.0 times leverage ratio through aggressive share repurchases, their strong track record and very bullish industry outlook suggest that shareholders need not be too concerned with rising debt levels. A more conservative approach would be to forgo the share repurchases and either allow the leverage ratio to fall, or to use the extra funding instead for further capital spending.FDX trades just over 13.5 times forward earnings guidance of $17.50 per share. Considering that EPS is growing at double-digit percentages annually, this look very cheap. FDX is a personal core holding and the recent underperformance suggests it may be a nice buying opportunity. When I last looked at FDX, I suggested a valuation multiple of 23.5 times earnings. While I could see shares trading up to that range, I now, however, need to emphasize that this is not a price target because of the high dependency of a healthy credit market to fuel both their large amounts of capital spending and share repurchases. If FDX ever indicates that capital spending will start to taper off, then it would be much easier for shares to reach a more richly valued multiple.FDX is a market leader in a large and rapidly growing market. I have a feeling that many shareholders may not be aware that the high level of capital spending means that FDX needs to continually take on extra debt in order to maintain its high level of dividends and share repurchases. While FDX looks likely to continue to execute on seizing market share, the negative impacts of a misstep may be outsized due to their greater leverage ratio. In spite of the risks, I rate shares a strong buy with plenty of room for multiple expansion, but intend to keep a close watch on their financial results moving forward.If you liked this article, please scroll up and click ""Follow"" next to my name to not miss any of my future articles.

4183550,25120,2018-06-24T07:15:45-04:00,"FedEx continues to see strong growth; although much of the growth is driven by pricing, volumes remain sound as well.Prospects remain good, as cost inflation is largely made up for by higher yields as well.The company sees continued growth, and trading at 14 times forward earnings, multiples are non-demanding given the growth and great execution.While long-term concerns about other stronger competitors making an entrance are real and valid, it seems that a lot has been priced in already.","FedEx (FDX) is well recognised for its quality versus its major peer UPS (UPS) and consequently has performed far better than its peer. Growing economies, notably e-commerce, bring real tailwinds to the business, but poses challenges in terms of supply constraints and input inflation as well.Perhaps more importantly, the strong tailwinds invite (other) competitors such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) or even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (pursuing vertical integration) to create a whole new range of perhaps much stronger competitors compared to the parties which FedEx has to compete with today and in the past.FedEx ended 2018 on a solid note as fourth-quarter revenues were up by 10% to $17.31 billion, marking a point acceleration from the 9% increase in annual sales. Notably the ground and freight segment were strong growers, express has seen a solid quarter as well, with services sales growth being uninspiring.So far so good, as the same cannot really be said for the cost base. Total expenses were up by 12% for the quarter, resulting in an operating earnings decline of 6% to $1.49 billion. The key reason for this earnings and margin decline is a $380 million impairment charge, but even if this is excluded, expenses rose by a little over 9%. Notably, purchased transportation was up by double digits, as the fuel bill jumped by 29%, driven by higher volumes and higher fuel prices of course.Thanks to a massive reduction in the effective tax rate, FedEx managed to grow net earnings by 10% to $1.13 billion, with earnings per share rising by a similar percentage to $4.15 per share, amidst a flattish share count.The company reported adjusted earnings of $5.91 per share, as the gap with GAAP earnings relates largely to the $1.40 per share impairment charge, a goodwill impairment charge on the Supply Chain business and, to a lesser extent ($0.39 per share), TNT integration charges.For the year, FedEx reported GAAP earnings of $16.79 per share, including a combined $2.75 per share charge related to the integration of TNT and impairment charges, while tax reform boosted earnings by $4.22 per share. Adjusted for tax reform, GAAP earnings totalled $12.57 per share as adjusted earnings came in at $15.31 per share.While it is certainly the case that business is booming, a lot of the revenue gains results from higher yields. Package volumes were flat for the quarter, with yields up 7%. Freight volume growth of 5% was accompanied by a 10% increase in yields, as the ground segment grew both volumes and yields by 6%.While earnings are strong, the increase in volumes on the network has a negative effect on the cash flows through reduced free cash flows. Capital spending was up by a quarter to $1.7 billion for the final quarter of the year. If this is representative for the investments going forward (running at $6.8 billion per annum), it surpasses deprecation charges of $3.2 billion a year, creating a $3.6 billion negative impact on free cash flow. To put this number into perspective, based on adjusted earnings of $15.31 per share, FedEx earned $4.1 billion this year. While fourth-quarter capital spending was somewhat elevated, it is very clear that free cash flow conversion is not that great.Hence the company is taking measures to make sure that the balance sheet remains in a healthy state. Holding $3.3 billion in cash, total debt stands at $16.6 billion for a $13.3 billion net debt load. Given the fact that the company has long employed a large group of employees, its liabilities (and assets) of its pension funds are huge, with benefit obligations totalling $30 billion in 2017; at the time resulting in a $3.6 billion underfunded status. This now appears to have come down to $2.2 billion, which including another half billion in lease obligations yields a $16 billion effective net debt load. Nonetheless, with adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion, leverage ratios remain just below the 2 times mark.It is a good thing in my eyes that FedEx is cutting its employment liabilities as these do appear to be somewhat real liabilities as the huge size of pension assets and liabilities makes that swings in the coverage ratios can have huge impacts on cash flows, if the underfunded status needs to be ""repaired"". This is certainly the case with over 400,000 workers being employed by the business as of today. Another big step in this process is the move by the company to transfer $6 billion worth of liabilities to Metropolitan Life Insurance company.For the coming fiscal year, FedEx expects a continuation of both sales and earnings growth. The company sees earnings of $17.00-17.60 per share this year, excluding TNT integration expenses and before the impact of mark-to-market pension liabilities.While the latter cannot be predicted, integration charges are seen at $1.35 per share this upcoming year, which is somewhat disappointing as they are not really coming down from the $1.36 per share this past year, and the deal with TNT has been closed for quite a while now.Shares of FedEx have been under a great deal of pressure this past week, following the earnings release. Shares fell from levels around $262 at the start of the week to $242 per share on Friday, as the 8% decline represents a $5.5 billion reduction in the market value of the firm.While it is certainly the case that shares are not yet on fire this year, one has to recognise the great momentum run is seen in recent years already, not to mention that shares traded at just $2 per share some 40 years ago, as Mr. Smith certainly has created a lot of shareholder value. The run from $2 to $242 per share corresponds to a cool 12% CAGR per annum, not even taking into account dividends yet.Having fallen to levels below the $50 mark during the crisis, shares broke through the $100 mark again in 2013, re-testing the highs of 2006/2007. In the past five years, shares rose another 150%, as returns far outpaced actual sales and earnings growth, implying real multiple inflation.At the midpoint of the adjusted earnings guidance of $17.30 per share for 2019, multiples have come down to just 14 times earnings, which look highly appealing. Of course, this multiple jumps a bit if we take into account the TNT integration charges; in fact it comes in around 15 times. This past year, FedEx did not take large pension charges, but of course in a world in which asset prices might remain stagnant or could even come down, this could still have huge (multi-billion) consequences for the business.That being said, multiples remain very manageable nonetheless. This in part can be explained by the poor cash flow conversion as the company continuously needs to invest greater sums to please its customers, as net property and equipment has risen to more than $28 billion. With net investments seriously dragging on cash flows, FedEx is not a high-dividend-paying stock. In fact, the low dividend has certainly allowed the company to quickly grow to its current size.Despite the worries about the global trade war, take notice and see that FedEx is largely a regional business in many continents as well, insulating it from the trade war threat to a large extent. Fact of the matter is that leverage is no real issue, although it will not come down quickly as well due to poor cash flow conversion. The good thing is that the company is quite active in reducing pension liabilities and risks, although they still remain substantial for now.While the free cash flow yield is not that great, cash flows automatically improve if growth slows down (creating a sort of natural hedge). While TNT integration expenses remain elevated in 2019, they still do not prevent the company from creating real earnings growth this year, as a good integration certainly has the potential to create value of the business and shareholders from 2019 onward.I guess that worries about near-term cash flow conversion and trade war are not the dominant factors holding shares back, as the key risk in my eyes is long-term competition to the business (model). While one can argue that competition from the likes of Amazon.com or Uber is not realistic (as they have a much higher cost of capital) and would not want to invest in a capital-intensive business to the degree that FedEx does, this might change if asset efficiency improves meaningfully. If drones could compete with parts of FedEx's business substantially with much higher asset efficiency, that concern is very real.That being said, replicating a global network with many hubs, knowledge, and other systems might not be so easy as not only the capital is needed but also expertise is very much needed as well. Hence I think that shares are de-risked sufficiently, trading at a 15-20% discount to the market. The outlook for the business at large remains sound despite near-term constraints in terms of infrastructure and riders, as well as long-term concerns about substitution effects. All these make me a buyer on further dips."
4184838,43041,2018-06-29T18:13:56-04:00,"FDX sold off, along with UPS, on the news of AMZN's entry into ""last-mile"" delivery.The stock has also been depressed by high and rising crude oil prices.This article reviews why I prefer FDX to another great company, UPS, and why I have been accumulating FDX against the newsflow.Many investors may wish to think about FDX as a long-term holding.","As most readers likely know, Amazon (AMZN) is getting into the delivery business - at least, sort of. Per a Seeking Alpha report that broke Thursday:Unsurprisingly, both FDX and UPS continued in their downtrends.But this sort of news was telegraphed at least as long ago as February. See, for example, a trade publication that ran this title:In this article, I want to first briefly make a case for focusing on a FDX long rather than UPS for a total return investor; but note, I'm not anti-UPS as an investment. I simply prefer FDX to continue its outperformance; I think past is prologue in this comparison. Second, I want to present both a 1-year chart showing each stock, then a long-term one comparing the two stocks since UPS went public:FDX data by YChartsThat's a 9% outperformance by FDX. Subtracting out a much higher dividend payout from UPS still leaves FDX with a 5+% outperformance.This is similar on a longer time frame (UPS in yellow this time):UPS data by YChartsFDX is the clear winner on essentially all time frames versus UPS.In addition, UPS has apparently been skimping on capital spending, which it plans to rectify in the next few years. But FDX has been investing heavily all along, and retaining most of its investments. Interestingly, FDX trades at a price:book ratio of 3.3X, whereas UPS trades at 70X (UPS has negative tangible equity). So there is more ""there"" there in FDX, both tangible and intangible, than at UPS. As far as forward P/E's go, UPS at $106 is around 15X consensus and FDX at $227 is at 13X consensus (ETrade figures, probably adjusted earnings for both companies).Thus, I've been accumulating FDX and not UPS.My accumulation of FDX began about three months ago in the $235 range, when FDX was selling off on China trade war headlines as well as the surge in the price of crude oil. The cash to buy it came from selling tech and bank stocks in late January, as I disclosed in several ""risk off"" articles.Now, FDX has lost ground again on the AMZN headline. While it may be early given all sorts of macro worries, the following sections present my main reasons why I'm not worried about the FDX price action, and continue to deploy and work down the one-third cash position I went to by late January/early February in such value/GARP names as FDX.If you are pressed for time, the final section summarizes the basic case for the stock.Pushing back against excessive fear of AMZN is almost a no-brainer as I see it (no guarantees). Think of what happened about a year ago. When AMZN and Sears (SHLD) announced that AMZN would list a Sears appliance, HD fell from around $155 to as low as around $145 in hours. I bought that dip, and many people noted the overreaction. More serious and less clear-cut were the sell-offs in retail stocks when AMZN announced the deal to buy Whole Foods. Yet I saw opportunity. Just two examples to buy the dip, which I did and wrote about:Now, I'm not primarily a retail chain investor, and by the time I decided to cut back sharply on stocks in favor of plain old cash 5 months ago, these were ""too high"" in my view, so I'm not long them now. Note, in relation to the current article, my timing was not perfect on those stocks, but sooner rather than later, Mr. Market simply forgot his worries on them and they joined the bull market.The underlying thesis is that I'm not afraid that AMZN is going to swallow the world. In an expanding global economy, lots of competitors can grow, and a stock with a depressed valuation, which I thought was the case for COST and TGT at mid-year last year, needs a lot less growth to be a good investment than AMZN does. That's how I see FDX here.Thus, I'm inclined to buy these sorts of sell-offs if I like the valuation and if the company being sold is strong in its own right. If direct competition from AMZN allows COST stock to have one of its best 12-month periods, I'm similarly good with FDX at my latest buy price, below $225 Thursday morning.That gets to a general discussion of FDX and the AMZN threat.Having been attracted to stocks other than the tech (QQQ) sector lately, I've been reading up on all sorts of names I was never interested in owning in my personal ""go-go"" days (the '90s) or during the more thematic investing I did after the Great Recession (risk on/off related mostly to QE cycles).These names now are, basically, the companies that make the gears of our economy run, or sometimes names that simply provide entertainment as the Great Recession period moves out of even the rear-view mirror. The more I learn the investment case that the best companies make for themselves, such as FDX, the more my view of these top companies evolves. After reviewing the history of FDX and its competencies, I look at it as an applied technology company. The core technologies involve sophisticated scheduling techniques as well as advanced package sorting techniques. Those and certain other core competencies are the ""brains"" while the ""muscle"" is the physical manifestation we see: the trucks, planes, Kinko's, drop boxes, etc. All those are necessary for now, but the genius of FDX lay in its vision.FDX has always known that it was going to be an innovator and category-creator, focused initially on accomplishing things that had not been done before. The earliest vision of the company famously came by the founder, Fred Smith, who is finally nearing retirement age at FDX. That vision, beginning way back in the 1960s, involved computers to direct logistics.Along the way, as with almost every innovative company, there were setbacks - things that were ahead of their time. Zapmail was one such, and if you're not aware of it, the link takes you to an engaging and detailed personal story of it. My ""take"" is that was a brilliant failure from a dedicated innovator.The best parts of the development of a public company often take place years later, and Fred Smith alluded to this in his prepared remarks in the latest conference call, expressing great enthusiasm for FDX's prospects. These include such potentially high-ROIC projects as gaining drop-off/pick-up areas at Walgreens (WBA), Kroger's (KR) and elsewhere, and partnering with Walmart (WMT). The acquisition of TNT Express, at a better price than the failed bid for it that UPS previously made, is costly, but with it and with FDX's many other global efforts, FDX may perhaps be in the lead position to be the world's dominant logistics company, moving all sorts of stuff from one place to another in a value-added manner. This business allows an unending stream of growth opportunities both vertically as well as horizontally, so I see FDX as a long-term growth story for decades to come.Now, AMZN is a great logistics company, too. So is WMT. They all can grow and prosper if they execute on a vision. But AMZN is a minuscule direct part of the FDX revenue stream, and given the failure of DHL to succeed in any way in the US delivery market, and given the relatively low margins FDX has compared to Amazon Web Services, it's implausible that AMZN will invest vast sums just to turn the UPS/FDX duopoly in the US into an oligopoly. (Not to ignore the US Postal Service.)Similarly, the oligopoly of UPS/FDX/DHL globally is likely a strong one; apologies if I am missing another major company, but there has been a lot of consolidation in this industry.That AMZN is going to partner with local companies per its press release tells me this is not a major, concerted effort.Thus, I bought the FDX dip, deploying cash on the sidelines, even though I already owned the stock.Next, two sections on the value proposition for FDX.Since it's some time since FY 2018 earnings were released (ending the end of May), it is more important to focus on the company's forecast for 2019 numbers. From the press release (with one bullet point omitted):The Street is looking for $71 B in revenues and $17.36 in non-GAAP EPS.Because the heavy expenses from the 2016 acquisition of TNT Express are projected to drop substantially after 2019, and the operational integration is proceeding or ahead of schedule, I think it's reasonable to use either the non-GAAP or GAAP projections as a starting point. It is sensible to exclude the unpredictable MTM (mark to market) pension adjustments from projected earnings. More importantly, FDX does not exclude amortization or stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP numbers. In doing this, it is acting consistent with the ""best practices"" companies such as Apple (AAPL) and many other techs, Deere (DE) and many others.Analysts agree with FDX, which is projecting that the TNT Express deal will be justified by providing both higher revenues but also nicely higher operating profit margins. Thus, beginning with their consensus for FY 2019, these are consensus numbers beyond there (ETrade data):These EPS increases are much faster than the 10% total revenue gain projected for 2021 over 2019. Some of that disparity probably comes from the assumption of share count reduction, but I think that more comes from projected margin improvement.A reason I'm comfortable with this is that in 2018, and in many prior years, FDX has shown the inherent value of the services it provides by increasing prices to keep up with rising fuel costs, even if package volume is lagging. This demonstrates that the value of the services that FDX (and UPS) provide is substantial. So, I will expect that FDX can and will make progress toward its goal of higher margins throughout the company. This is being done with continued high capital spending of 8% of revenues projected for this fiscal year (but the capital spending cycle at FDX as a percent of revenue may happily be trending down for a while).Note that 2018 results had a number of favorable one-time EPS adjustments, so yoy comparison backward with 2017 and forward with 2019 are tricky.A key is that there is no major acquisition planned, so that the 9% revenue growth projected for this year is organic. Yet, analysts are only projecting 10% cumulative revenue growth over the next two years; this leaves upside potential, which I see as a good thing for people buying now.A conservative way of thinking of FDX, a company that has made many large and small acquisitions, is to use the GAAP projection of about $16 for this year's EPS. Off of a $227 share price at Thursday's close, the earnings yield (reciprocal of the P/E of 14X) is 7%. If that yield can simply grow in line with earnings, and if earnings grow at the same 7% annual rate I tentatively project for sales, i.e. assuming no margin increases and continued integration expenses for future major acquisitions - then 10 years later, we would be looking at an earnings yield of 14%. The average earnings yield for the decade ahead would be around 10%. In comparison, a conservative investor who could find a 10-year bond of FDX or a company of similar credit quality would be receiving somewhere close to 4%, though it would be in cash. FDX only pays out a small dividend, currently around 1% of its share price, preferring to both reinvest its earnings in the business and retire shares. I agree with this capital management strategy. FDX is a growth cyclical, so it should not commit to much of a dividend, and as long as its P/E remains moderate, buybacks should be long-term accretive given today's low borrowing costs.Overall, I'm comfortable committing to FDX using this sort of projection. But I think it can do better than that, as is discussed next.If, however, we take the rosier scenario that for some time, FDX will integrate TNT Express and avoid large acquisitions, then it makes sense to think about consensus projections. These are that earnings in FY 2018-9 are somewhat depressed due to the TNT acquisition costs as well as heavy capital spending, and that while it has been painful, the case to buy TNT (which UPS also wanted to control) is basically strong: it makes FDX a much stronger global competitor.So, if we think of how Mr. Market may value FDX three years hence, looking backward in June 2022 at projected $22.75 EPS in 2021, we see this implies a 10X P/E on those forward earnings.If FDX gets to that next level of EPS, I would be very comfortable investing on a projected 14X TTM P/E. This leaves room for P/E expansion or for cyclical downturns in earnings.A 14X TTM based on $22.75 EPS gives a $318.50 share price.This implies a 12% annual compound return of price over the next three years. Add in a 1% dividend yield and my total return goal is 13% under this scenario.What I like about this goal is its robustness to all the many uncertainties. Even if it is off by 5% per year - an easy thing to happen - the total return would be 8%, which is about what I get to under a much more conservative scenario discussed first.Longer term, I think it is reasonable to look at FDX growing in line with the US and global economy, and eventually a little slower than that as it gets increasingly mature. So I would expect that even if matters work out as I am shooting for, eventually the law of large numbers would apply here and bring total returns lower.While traders are reacting to the latest spikes in crude oil prices, trade war headlines, AMZN's splashy news, and so on, my view is that the largest risk to FDX is recession. Also, my understanding is that FDX has a mandatory retirement policy at age 75, and founder, Chairman and CEO Fred Smith turns 75 in August 2019. We shall see how that situation is handled and if he leaves, how the company functions in his absence.Many other risks to FDX are disclosed in its 10-K and elsewhere, and should be understood by investors in this stock.FDX meets most of the criteria for investments that I began seeking out when I concluded that a momentum-driven melt-up looked too exuberant in late January given Fed tightening plus headwinds from rising interest rates and the long, strong run-up in crude oil prices.I began seeking out stocks that were off their highs, such as FDX, with room for both margin and P/E expansion going forward. The margin issue is significant. S&P's spreadsheet for the S&P 500 (SPY) shows its estimate of operating margins for the index going back to Q1 2006. Of the 49 quarters it reports on, through Q1 2018, the four highest-margined quarters have been the last 4 of them. That's 4/4. And the trend is upward. Q1 2018 was the highest of all, at 11.39%. It's the only quarter above 11% out of 49 quarters.I agree with Warren Buffett about margins. I believe they tend to revert to a mean. Thus, I have been concerned about owning companies with elevated margins. That in turn is why I have been looking for stocks of leading companies in duopolies or oligopolies such as FDX, Carnival Corp. (CCL), DE, etc. that are showing normal or even depressed margins while still trading at normal P/E's. A key screen I have been also looking for, though, is a track record of long term outperformance by the company and its stock.FDX is one of a decent-sized group of stocks that fit these criteria.The evolving FDX network of capabilities cannot be replicated other than by immense application of capital and lots of time. It is just too complex and requires almost perfect execution every working day. I look at FDX as primarily a logistics company and wonder if it may move up the value chain toward higher-margined, more asset-lite activities as it becomes more clearly a knowledge-based company.FDX knows what businesses, and consumers, across the world want out of the movement of goods, and increasingly, it knows the complicated and sometimes murky details of how to accomplish these tasks for them on time and safely, and at the lowest possible cost. Managing this task within a homogeneous country such as the US, with no customs duties or the like to contend with, is so difficult that, as mentioned, DHL dropped out of the US after losing big bucks on the effort. Providing these services across international borders is that much more difficult.Thus, I think that AMZN has enough on its plate in its effort to turn its retail margins up from break-even, as they are now after imputing a charge from AWS to the retail side of AMZN. Over time, the world is a very big place, and if for some reason AMZN expands in this sector, OK - there's usually room for another player. But the example of COST and many other retailers since AMZN's deal for Whole Foods set off a selling panic in retail stocks suggests to me that taking the other side of the AMZN fear trade is, once again, a good thing to consider.Finally, if crude oil prices increase due to a stronger economy, that's not really a material negative to FDX. If they increase due to shortages, as with the issues in Western Canada right now, that's not too good. But...Usually, though, these supply-side crude oil issues get resolved sooner rather than later, and a long term asset - the shares of a major company - tends to incorporate this news of the day almost as soon as the shortage becomes apparent. So, it becomes too late to sell on the news and can represent - conversely - a buying opportunity.In summary, I like FDX at current levels given my moderately constructive view for the global economy. 40 years ago, FDX was at $1.20, adjusted for splits (Yahoo Finance data). At $227, the CAGR has been 14%, as opposed to the price return of the DJIA, at around 8.9%.FDX has appreciated at a 10.5% annual rate over the past 20 years, as opposed to the SPY, which has appreciated at a 4.4% rate (dividends not included in any of the above numbers).If Fred Smith is correct about his enthusiasm about FDX having truly superior prospects going forward, the best for this stock may be yet to come. If not, the stock may continue to be an ongoing source of alpha, as it has been.Submitted Friday pre-market, FDX indicated around $228.Thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you wish to provide."
4185557,103321,2018-07-05T12:02:43-04:00,FedEx has a competitive international shipping network.The rise of e-commerce will provide a long runway of growth for the company.The company's share price is attractive as its P/E ratio is currently below its historical average.,"FedEx Corporation (FDX) is a leading international courier delivery services company. The company should be able to continue its growth momentum in its fiscal 2019 as it has a competitive international shipping network, a strong global economy that should offer as a tailwind to its business, and a long runway of growth from the rise of e-commerce. Its shares are currently trading below its historical average. We believe this is a good opportunity to invest in a company with bright long-term prospect.FDX data by YChartsLet us first take a look at FedEx’s latest quarterly report. In 2018, the company’s revenue grew by 8.6% to $65.5 billion (see table below). Its adjusted EPS grew by 26.6% to $15.31 per share from $12.09 per share in 2017. As we can see, both its top and bottom lines continue to grow at a fast pace.Source: Q4 2018 Earnings ReleaseA massive international shipping networkFedEx has a global shipping network that is difficult for potential new rivals to replicate. In the U.S., there are more than 53,000 U.S. locations. In fact, about 80% of the population in the country are within 5 miles of a FedEx hold location. FedEx also has almost 11,000 packaged pickup locations in the U.S. through Walgreens (WBA). The company continues to enhance customers' access to its services with additional FedEx office locations. The company expects to have 50 new FedEx office locations inside Walmart (WMT) stores before the start of the upcoming peak season. The company also plans to expand to 500 FedEx office locations inside Walmart stores over the next two years.Operating margin expansionFedEx has improved its operating margin in fiscal 2018. Its adjusted operating margin was 11.5% in its fiscal 2018. This was an improvement of 40 basis points from 2017. The company has invested heavily to improve the efficiency and reduce costs, especially in FedEx Ground, and has resulted in significant savings. This result is evident in its Q4 result as its FedEx Ground operating margin increased by 90 basis points to 17.3%. In its Express segment, the company is also investing to modernize its fleet. This should help offset rising fuel expense and result in significant operating efficiency improvement in the years to come.Favorable economic outlookFedEx should continue to benefit from strong global economic growth in 2018 and 2019. As can be seen from the table below, global GDP growth rate is expected to reach 3.2% and 3.1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In the U.S., economic growth rate is also expected to remain at about 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively.Source: Q4 2018 Investor PresentationE-commerce will provide long runway of growthAlthough FedEx has benefited greatly from the growth in e-commerce in the past decade, e-commerce still accounts for less than 20% of its overall revenue. This means that there is still a long runway of growth available. The company has a strategy to capture this trend. The company has two major fulfillment centers in the U.S. that can reach about 94% of the population. The services offer its retail customers an opportunity to focus on their core business while letting FedEx manage warehouse and fulfillment inventory, transportation, management, returns, etc. Not only is FedEx able to offer services in the U.S., through the acquisition of P2P Mailing Limited, the company also can now provide unique last-mile delivery options to more than 200 countries.Share price of FedEx has increased by nearly 36% in the past 3 years but is down about 6% year to date due to stock market correction earlier this year and recent trade war concerns. Because of the decline, its share price is currently attractive with a trailing P/E ratio of 14.8x. This is significantly below its 5-year average P/E ratio of 26.9x. Compared to its rival United Parcel Services’ (NYSE:UPS) trailing P/E ratio of 19.5x, FedEx is also trading at a discount. We believe FedEx’s share price is currently attractive at this level. Besides an attractive valuation, FedEx also announced to increase its quarterly dividend by 30% in its latest conference call.Source: Created by author, Morningstar.comInvestors of FedEx face several risks. The first obvious risk was the cyber security attack that happened last year. Although the company has taken necessary steps to increase its security level, we cannot rule out of any future attacks. The second risk is related to recent trade war concerns. While we believe the market may have already factored some of this concern in FedEx’s share price already, a full-blown trade war may derail the current global economic growth momentum. This will negatively impact FedEx’s business.FedEx should be able to continue to grow its top and bottom lines in its fiscal 2019 due to its competitive international shipping network, cost saving initiatives that should result in margin expansion, a strong global economy, and a long runway of growth from the rise of e-commerce. Its current share price is attractive with a growing dividend. We believe now is a good opportunity for long-term investors to take advantage of its share price weakness.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4189001,102744,2018-07-22T12:45:58-04:00,"How much of the revenue is directly from international trade?Which segments account for the majority of operating margins?Are we seeing the ""Amazon effect""?What the current valuation is telling us.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX), like many industrials in 2018, has not been having a great year. The recent forfeiture of gains could be an opportunity to buy into a well-run logistics behemoth with ample runway for growth, or it could be the market telling us something has fundamentally changed about the landscape of the business. With Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fears and trade wars rife in the business media, I would like to take a look at the data in an attempt to quantify the risks heading into 2019.Image Source: Basic Risk Analysis - Offshore CoursesFedEx uses four operating segments when reporting earnings. Express, Freight, Ground, and Services account for the four segments. Seen by revenue, Express is clearly the major component of the business commanding over 50% of total revenue.FedEx - OverviewFor the sake of simplicity, I will be ignoring revenues from Services and ""Other"" as the impact of trade tariffs should be minimal in those areas. Express is the predominant international segment, utilized by businesses to transport goods, while the Ground and Freight segments are mostly continental US-centric (which still makes them a potential victim of trade disputes, but minimally). The Ground segment is mainly residential, which will be discussed later in the competition segment.A good way to understand a business and its reporting segments is to look at operating metrics such as total revenue, earnings, and operating margins. In the annual report for FedEx, it is kind enough to show how much revenue in Express comes directly from international shipping.With an eye towards exposure to international trade, we can assess how much of the business is vulnerable to changes in the geopolitical climate. Looking at the past three years, noting that the FedEx 2018 calendar year ended in May, we can determine the size and the trend for international revenues.It is important to note that FedEx fiscal year ends May 31st*Freight in this chart refers to express freight*With total revenues of around 30-35% exposed to international trade, this logistics behemoth is certainly vulnerable to trade disputes. While this should come as no surprise given the long time international focus of FedEx, the world will not stop moving, and while these revenues may slow or decline, a decline of more than 30% is unlikely in my opinion solely from the trade war, so realistically we are looking at about 10% of revenues (30% of 30%).Furthermore revenues are not everything; operating cash flow and margins can go a long way to show us just where FedEx is really making its money.Now remember FedEx does not break out Ground revenues to explicitly state international shipping, but the segment operates in the US and Canada which should limit exposure. The Ground segment is the provider of small-package ground delivery (think e-commerce, the largest growth market). What this shows us is that an outsized portion of the operating income is derived directly from the Ground segment. Another point to make is that the TNT integration costs should be affecting the Express operating income, but are not being reported in that manner, which would make Ground the bread winner of the company.So if the Ground segment accounts for most of the operating earnings, why is the stock underperforming in 2018? The other specter in the room is Amazon and smaller companies attempting to upend the US ground market. E-commerce has been a buzzword in the market for longer than I care to remember, so it should come as no surprise that competition in the arena exists. The important thing to watch with competition is the operating margins of the company. In order to give a broader look, I will look back to 2013 to compile margins of the last five years to assess what is going on.FedEx Annual Report 2015From this we can clearly see a degradation in the Ground operating margins, while not extreme, a slow trend presents itself. Amazon is known for going after margins, and given the irregular margins seen in Ground (roughly double all other segments) and Amazon's use of such services, it should be considered a threat to FDX, but does this threat warrant a forward PE of 13.6 on a company with a long runway for growth?SourceIt is important to realize that so far, history has shown that UPS (UPS) and FDX have had a tremendous grasp on the US market. DHL had tried to expand into the US, but was forced out during the 2008 recession and now mainly operates an express business doing international shipping into and out of the US. While an express business is by no means cheap to run, the infamous last mile delivery requires a much larger network and internal infrastructure to even attempt competing.While DHL is now attempting to create such a network again in the US (DHL to relaunch U.S. package delivery service), this just shows the demand and lucrative nature of this market. The entrenched competitive positioning of FDX should not be overlooked however; in fact the CEO and Chairman Fred Smith just within this last year announced pickup and drop-off locations and, in the FY2017 chairman's letter, had automation front and center.Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, has consistently been at the forefront of this industry, and given his positions on automation and recognition of e-commerce leadership seems to be doing everything right. I believe it is important to keep an eye on margins, and while many believe that the industry is in for extreme margin compression, I still see the competitive advantages of the network that FDX has managed to create, including pioneering uses of automation, as being able to withstand much of what is to come.While Amazon may be a powerhouse of logistics and the use of AI/algorithms to find efficiencies, that same concept has been a driving factor for FDX since the computer first came into existence and should not be overlooked.Fred Smith wrote a paper at Yale in the 1960s that become the groundwork for FedEx detailing the idea of overnight delivery in the ""information age.""With average EPS forecasts of $17.34 for FY19 and $19.96 for FY20 and a stock market price of $236.55 as of 7/19/2018, this gives us our forward PE of 13.6 for this year and 11.8 for next year. So what exactly is the PE telling us? As can be seen by the historical PE, this is an exceptionally low multiple given the nature of the growth in market.FDX data by YChartsClearly, the market is tepid about the potential for revenue losses due to trade and margin compression by new competitors into the market. I see these concerns as overplayed and believe the e-commerce tide to continue adding growth to the bottom line at FDX. E-commerce is expecting to continue to grow in the US to become just 17% of US retail by 2022, which would make for a CAGR of 9.29% between then and now. Once e-commerce surpasses 20%, it is expected to begin to grow much more rapidly, forecasting even more growth still many years away.With this in mind, I believe FDX is a clear buy-the-dip opportunity at the current valuations. With a 13 PE, even in a scenario where 10% of revenue is lost due to trade (where margins are weakest) or where the high margins of Ground begin to slip, I view a 13 PE as an ample margin of safety given the future growth of the industry.Last but not least, I think it is important to consider the future of the industry. Many commentators believe that automation will be destructive to the industry over the long run and commoditize the service, making margins slim to none. Technology has had this effect on industries and services throughout history, digitization of most things being a great example (think ad-based business models); however, the vast network required to efficiently operate the complexities in a system like FedEx's are far from being open sourced and automated. The coming decades should be an exciting time for the company to drive efficiencies and become more profitable as technology is utilized more efficiently. Just as owning the land was a sure sign of wealth, I believe owning the machines of the future will be just the same. For at least a decade, technological change should only be for the better for a Goliath-like FedEx, but as always, it's good to keep a keen watch and observe the competition to understand what is really going on."
4183442,103519,2018-06-22T15:47:07-04:00,FedEx reported very strong results for the quarter and fiscal year.EPS and revenue both grew double digits YoY and exceeded analyst expectations.The company's growth outlook remains positive due to a rebounding global economy and high international shipping demand.,"FedEx's (FDX) results were outstanding across most relevant metrics, with double-digit EPS and revenue growth. FedEx's international business continues its rapid expansion and will likely accelerate as the global economy improves and developing countries expand their e-commerce operations. FedEx remains the top delivery services company in the world and a top investment choice for investors.(Source: FedEx Results Presentation)Earnings and revenues were up 27% and 10%, respectively, for the quarter, impressive results. Growth for the entire year was solid as well, with EPS and revenue growing at 41% and 9%, respectively. Results were driven by four key factors: widening margins/yields, increased number of shipments/traffic, tax benefits, and the TNT Express acquisition.Margins and YieldsFedEx has sought to incrementally raise its revenue per package, or yield, during the last year. It has done so through raising its prices and by increasing its share of higher-quality, and pricey, shipping options. Higher fuel prices have also marginally contributed to rising yields, although these get cancelled out by rising costs as well. Excluding rising fuel costs, yields were up by low single digits in most segments and markets. Although the improvements were modest, increasing yields had massive effects on EPS growth as you can clearly see from the company's results.Increased Shipments and TrafficAs with yields, FedEx saw rising shipments across its business segments. Shipments mostly increased in the company's international markets, excluding the US, due to the company's expanding areas of operation and the growth of e-commerce across the globe.Tax BenefitsAs with most other corporations, FedEx benefited from lowered tax rates brought by the most recent tax reform. The company estimates $1.1 billion in savings from reduced corporate tax rates, with smaller sums (see here for a more thorough breakdown). This figure is very close to the company's total increase in net income, $1.5 billion, implying that the vast majority of the company's great performance during the quarter was due to tax reform.TNT ExpressIn 2016, FedEx acquired TNT Express, a Dutch delivery services company. FedEx intended to increase its international delivery capabilities with the purchase and has broadly succeeded as international shipments have increased rapidly ever since.The deal, however, proved to be more costly than expected. TNT's underdeveloped IT systems lead to a massive cyber attack in 2017, with massive losses (Read more: NotPetya cyber attack on TNT Express cost FedEx $300m). The need to replace/upgrade the company's IT capabilities proved costly. Integration expenses totaled $470 million last year, with another $450 million expected for 2019 and a further $200 million for 2020, quite a bit more than expected. Management remains relatively upbeat about the acquisition, however:During the earnings call, management heavily emphasized the company's positive growth outlook. Guidance/targets for next year are quite solid, with the company expecting widening margins and around 9% revenue/EPS growth.(Source: FedEx Results Presentation)FedEx's financial performance will very likely remain positive due to improving economic conditions around the globe and higher e-commerce sales.Global Economic OutlookFedEx, as a delivery services company, depends quite heavily on the broad state of the economy to sustain and grow its revenues. The company seems uniquely well positioned to take advantage of the world's improving economic outlook. The company is expanding its operations across the globe and is currently located in 42 countries which account for 75% of the world's GDP and is planning further expansions. The company's acquisition of TNT Express, although plagued with unanticipated expenses, has been successful in growing its international footprint so far and will likely continue to do so.Conditions in the US, which remains the company's largest market, are quite great as well. The country remains on the second-longest uninterrupted economic expansion in its modern history, and there is no sign of it stopping (Read more: U.S. Economic Expansion Now Second-Longest Ever: 5 Picks).Management was, in general terms, quite sanguine regarding improving economic conditions around the globe:(Source: FedEx Results Presentation)Although tariffs, and the possibility of a broader trade war between the US and its trading partners, could negatively affect the company, the effect is/will very likely be minor. FedEx's management has stated that the tariffs affect only a very small portion of its sales in China and the US, and all indications are that shipments between the two countries will remain unchanged. No information was given concerning EU and other tariffs.E-commerceE-commerce sales have been rapidly increasing around the globe for the last few years. Although internet retailers, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have been household names in most developed countries for years, they still have quite a bit of room to grow in developing countries. In my native Colombia, most internet deliveries remain relatively expensive, although things are rapidly improving, I imagine the situation is the same in most developing countries.(Source: Statista)FedEx will very likely benefit immensely as e-commerce sales increase around the globe, due to the company's ease of delivery, speed, brand recognition, and the large number of markets in which it operates.FedEx's quarter showed solid financial performance and a positive, and improving, outlook. Although a possible trade war and acquisition-related expenses have the possibility of negatively affecting the company, FedEx's quarter was overwhelmingly positive, and investors should take advantage."
4183426,44781,2018-06-22T14:17:18-04:00,"It's hard to find a company with better long-term dividend growth metrics than FDX.In just the last 4 years alone, FDX's quarterly dividend has increased more than four-fold.Sure, the company's yield is low, but FDX shares have appreciated nicely over time, resulting in significant long-term alpha relative to the broader markets.","FedEx (FDX) is one of the easiest stocks for me to own in today’s market environment. Unlike many of the other high quality DGI names with strong growth prospects that I follow, FDX isn’t irrationally overpriced. Actually, at ~16x 2018 EPS expectations, I would say that the shares are trading close to fair value. What’s more, FDX appears to offer strong growth prospects looking out to the medium/long term as it is propelled forward by several secular tailwinds, including globalization, urbanization, and the retail shift from brick and mortar to eCommerce.FDX has posted double-digit growth for 3 consecutive years now and analysts expect to continue to see strong growth looking ahead to 2018, 2019, and 2020. Because of this, I think it’s one of the strongest low-yielding DGI plays in the market today.Before I get going on this analysis, I have to admit that I stand corrected. In a recent thread here on SA, I mentioned that I thought FDX had gotten a bit expensive. Prior to the most recent quarter, analysts' expectations pointed towards a ~17.5x forward P/E ratio using 2018 expectations. Well, management’s most recent guidance is much higher than that figure and when using management’s $15.31 adjusted EPS estimate for FY18, which is up 27% year over year, FDX appears to be much more attractively priced on a forward P/E basis.I still don’t think that ~16x forward is particularly cheap for a cyclical name in the transport space, but I don’t think it’s irrationally expensive either. After a bit of a dip after earnings, FDX appears to be fairly priced here and if I wasn’t already so long the stock, I’d be strongly considering buying shares.Source: F.A.S.T. GraphsAs you can see on the F.A.S.T. Graph above, FDX is trading just a tad bit below its average valuation line during the last decade or so. Longer term, FDX’s “normal” P/E ratio is higher than the 17.0x highlighted in this graph dating back to 2008; however, much of that elevation is due to a period of time in the mid-2000s where FDX traded in the 22-24x range consistently. I think the 10-year “normal” comparison makes the most sense here and further justifies my claim that FDX shares are priced fairly at the moment.With that being said, it’s also worth noting that when FDX falls, shares tend to fall hard. At the trough of the Great Recession, FDX traded for ~10x earnings. In 2011, FDX shares plummeted to ~12.5x earnings. More recently, in early 2016, FDX shares fell down to ~13x earnings. These bearish events are rare for FDX and thus far, they’ve always represented strong buying opportunities as the stock has bounced back nicely. However, it’s important to note that even at ~16x forward (or ~17x ttm), FDX isn’t near the bottom end of its recent historical range. In other words, the margin of safety available at today’s prices isn’t overly wide.However, as Warren Buffett states, it’s better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price and I certainly couldn’t blame anyone for increasing exposure to FDX on this dip. Heck, I’m thinking about doing the very same thing. High quality industrial names are selling off across the board. 3M (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and Boeing (BA) have all sold off in recent weeks on Chinese trade war concerns and I’m becoming interested in adding shares of all of these high quality companies.Being that I already have a full position in FDX and an overweight position in BA, I’m actually more tempted to add to MMM and initiate exposure to ITW, though I’m not sure if that is the right decision because neither of those two companies can stack up to FDX’s growth prospects.I wouldn’t be surprised to see continued weakness in the industrials/global transports because of the volatile trade rhetoric dominating the markets at the moment. Therefore, I’m not in a hurry to buy these names. However, they are all rising in the ranks of my watch list because while I don’t know where they’re headed in the short term, but if I had to guess, I’d say that all of these strong global operations will be just fine over the long-term.In the short term, FedEx seems to be one of the major beneficiaries from the recent tax reform bill, which is playing a large part in those 27% yoy growth expectations. FDX has made a habit of posting double-digit bottom line growth in recent years, but management’s outlook for 2018 was even more bullish during the Q4 earnings release (this was posted prior to the tax reform becoming law) when they stated that the company’s EPS guidance could increase by ~$4.50-$5.50 should the tax reform go through. Management cited the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities as the primary cause for the big bottom line increase, though lowering their corporate tax rate definitely doesn’t hurt.Logistics companies across the world are posting solid growth due to the secular growth tailwind coming from the shift from physical retail to eCommerce, but FDX appears to be the best of the bunch when you look at its operational results. FDX’s primarily rival United Parcel Services (UPS) is expected to post 21% growth during FY18, which is definitely respectable as a standalone figure, but notably lags FDX’s guidance. What’s more, FDX is expected to post double-digit growth in FY19 and FY20, while UPS in slated to post high single-digit growth during both of these years by analysts.FDX isn’t hampered down by a large unionized work force and does a good job of incentivizing driver efficiency/performance. FDX has also made investments into its global presence and focuses on large business to business freight rather than the more difficult/costly business to customer/last mile deliveries. I also find FDX’s balance sheet to be more attractive to UPS’s. FDX carries a much lower debt to capital ratio (48.12 versus UPS’s 95.17%).I own both UPS and FDX in a logistics basket because of the different yields that the two companies offer. UPS’s 3.2% dividend is much larger than FDX’s 1.05% yield. Each company offers pros and cons relative to one another and together, I think they represent solid exposure to a growth industry that I like long term. However, the one area that FDX really shines relative to UPS (and just about every other stock in the market) is dividend growth.Knowing that management was guiding for ~25% EPS growth in 2018, I expected a hefty dividend increase from FDX. Recently FedEx has been one of the most generous DGI companies in the market in terms of their annual percentage increases (the company’s last 5 dividend increases have come in at 33.33%, 25%, 60%, 25%, and 30%, respectively). Management certainly didn’t disappoint last week when they announced a 30% increase, from $0.50/share to $0.65/share on a quarterly basis.Sure, the yield is low. Some DGI investors might say that FDX’s 1% yield is unacceptable low. However, this company’s yield is so small because of the strong share price appreciation over the years fueled by stellar bottom line growth. I understand that FDX doesn’t help a lot of income-oriented investors who need dividends to spend in the present, but for those still in the accumulation phase, I think FDX deserves strong consideration for a spot within a DGI portfolio.FedEx’s current quarterly dividend is more than 4x the size of the company’s quarterly payments 5 years ago. I’m not banking on another 4x move in the dividend over the next 5 years but I’d be very surprised if the quarterly payments haven’t more than doubled by this time in 2023.Just take a look at this trend. Since initiating its dividend in 2002, FDX has provided investors with an average annual dividend growth rate of 36% and a dividend growth CAGR of 26.5%.Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs This is how you slowly, but surely, build wealth. This 1% yield isn’t one to turn your nose up at or sleep on. I’m quite content with a full position in FDX and small yield and all. I wholeheartedly expect the passive income generated by this company’s shares to play a major role in my eventual retirement a few decades down the road."

The press release can be found here.Source: Seeking AlphaA pretty nice beat for a company of this size. Below we can see how the company managed to do compared to Q4 2017. All numbers are Adjusted(non-GAAP).Despite rising costs limited drivers, fuel was able to help as the rise in fuel prices was largely not recognized. FDX managed to grow their margin 40 basis points to 11.5%. As noted from the press release ""Fourth quarter operating results benefited from higher base rates, increased volume and the favorable net impact of fuel at each transportation segment. Accelerated wage increases for certain hourly employees partially offset these benefits. "" Growing margins is extremely important in a business that handles so many packages. As we see the slightest improvement can cause a huge difference in EPS.Below we can see how FedEx performed in 2018 against 2017.Source: FedEx Investor RelationsWhile there was a decent amount of growth, in our view, a large part of their apparent ""earnings growth"" is due to the changes in our tax laws. As stated in the earnings announcementFull-year net results include tax benefits of $2.1 billion ($7.71 per diluted share) attributable to:Without these gains we would have saw earnings pressure from the integration of TNT Express. Going forward FedEx will have less costs related to the integration and will start to recognize synergies.Also noteworthy, that while unable to give full guidance they give an idea of where earnings should be before one time integration expenses and retirement plan account adjustments.Source: FedEx Investor RelationsGiven a mid range between $17-17.60 we can assume around $17.30 in earnings before one time costs. That means FedEx trading at $256 share trades for less then 15x forward earnings. On a TTM basis, we see that it trades at 15.85 times earnings which is also historically cheap for the past 5 years.FDX data by YChartsAdditionally, We can see compared to competitor UPS, FedEx trades at a lesser multiple. While not much, we believe due to being superior in ground shipments and freight, it deserves a premium not a discount.UPS PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsSource: FedEx Investor RelationsTaking a look at another competitor, XPO logistics, we do a comparison.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWhile XPO is growing much faster, much of its growth is coming from a spur of acquisitions. FedEx, has the chance to continue its leadership position in the market by cross selling services from freight to last mile. Yet, we see a forward p/e of almost 2x FedEx for XPO.With more and more businesses becoming online only, it is safe to say FedEx has growth coming its way for years. While it is not the only carrier in the business it is certainly becoming the carrier of choice. With faster delivery routes than UPS it will continue to add businesses who want to deliver as fast as they can. Fast delivery is extremely important in a world where Amazon is offering two day shipping for Prime members at cost, and there is no patience for delays by anyone anymore.Source: U.S. E-commerce Stat StudyAs we can see from 2017 to 2022 we will see a sharp rise from $409 billion in online sales to an estimated $638 Billion in online sales. So what is FedEx possibly going to earn from this?Below we can see estimates.Source: Statistics PortalWe can see that FedEx along with TNT now owned by FDX, that the own 29% of the shipping courier market in 2017. If we take the total value of shipments in 2022 at $638 billion and assume FedEx can just maintain their market share not growing or losing any, we can see FedEx carrying an additional $66 billion worth of goods. That is going to be a nice bump for future earnings. Remember this is global and not U.S. only. While some may believe this is a threat, we have seen no impact from this trend. As many retailers have been facing challenges due to E-Commerce, some are using the change to their benefit. Those such as Macy's (M) have used this strategy to turn their business around with great results. In time we will see more and more businesses in retail adopt this model in order to not only grow but survive.Source: E-Market RetailThe above chart shows us how much room for growth there still is for digital only and how popular omni-channel is growing as well. The article states:""Multichannel retailers are capturing more online sales through flexible delivery options like buy online, pick up in-store; the addition of lower-priced goods to reach a minimum shipping threshold; automatic replenishment; and expanding categories sold online as traditional supermarkets have done with groceries.US omnichannel customers—those buying in-store and online—make up only 7% of all customers, according to Criteo data from November 2017. Yet this small segment is responsible for 27% of all retail sales. By comparison, 49% are offline-only buyers and generate 49% of sales, while 44% are online-only buyers and contribute to the smallest share of sales (24%).""This can be a possible threat, or this could be a net positive. The way I perceive this, is that stores in the future will run a slimmer inventory as sku's grow. However, they will ship the item directly to your home. As you will realize if you have ever gone to the shoe store, like DSW, if they are missing your size they will ship it from another store to your home. I believe this will become more popular as retailers continue to find ways to battle online only competitors. Either is beneficial to FedEx as both offer opportunity.Fedex has been beating UPS at the game lately. During the very busy Christmas season we saw FDX have less delays then UPS. This is important as guaranteed delivery dates by retailers are usually the result of estimated shipment times from their carriers. When they cannot trust their carrier they have a huge problem. The consumer doesn't usually blame the shipper but rather will blame the retailer who sold them the goods. With FedEx delivering on time, retailers will grow to make them their courier of choice.Source: Fits Small businessWe can also see that FedEx is slightly cheaper than UPS. While this is only the ground rates, it is the most important in my opinion. While this may not seem like much, to a retailer offering free shipping or covering most of the cost it does. Multiple packages a day saving close to $1 really adds up.Last we can see FedEx is faster in the most important category.Source: Fedex Investor RelationsFedEx trades at a fairly low multiple considering the long runway for growth. If there was a fairly valued business with a large moat that was truly great, I would say this would be it. FedEx competes in a market with limited competition and once it earns its customers they tend to stick. With the S&P trading at 16.5x forward earnings estimated and FedEx at 14.8 forward earnings estimates, we are at a safe valuation. If we can get to a 16x or 17x multiple we will be close to a $275-$295 price range. I am holding this for the long term as I believe it will grow for years to come. Sadly I missed my chance when it was only $70, but, luckily was able to enter between $235-$245. I hope to hear feedback and your thoughts on FedEx."
4156634,95006,2018-03-15T09:02:09-04:00,"For the past several years, I have specialized in researching cyclical stocks.My research has mostly focused on finding the best way to profit from cyclical stocks near the bottom of the economic cycle.With the dramatic rise in prices of many stocks, I have been writing a series of articles examining how far these stocks could fall if there is a downturn.FedEx stock has shown in the past that it is susceptible to significant drawdowns on a regular basis.I offer an alternative investment idea that is more defensive for current owners of FedEx who want to keep their money in the market instead of going to cash.","A few months ago, I wrote an article titled ""How Investors Could Have Easily Avoided Chicago Bridge & Iron's Sell-Off."" My basic thesis was that if investors would have looked back far enough in history, they would have known that Chicago Bridge & Iron (NYSE:CBI) was a highly cyclical stock and that they could expect sell-offs of the stock up to 80% to happen on occasion.The most pointed critique of the article came from investors who were sitting on gigantic losses in their CBI stock. Several of them noted that my article didn't do them a whole lot of good now, and they wondered where the article had been a year earlier, before CBI's price had dropped.Even though I claim no ability to predict the top of any stock, I have been trying my best in a recent series of articles to examine some of these rapidly rising stocks from a different point of view - a point of view that examines how far they might fall, rather than simply examining how far they might continue to rise.In January and February, I wrote about 11 cyclical industrial stocks asking the questions ""How far could they fall?"" if we were to have a market downturn. Beginning in March, I switched over to the service sector and asked the same question. So far, in March I have covered Union Pacific (UNP) and Costco (COST). This article will examine FedEx (FDX) and see what its historical cycles might be able to tell us about its next potential downcycle.FDX data by YChartsThe main question I'm seeking to answer here is whether or not it is reasonable to think that FedEx might be near the top of a price cycle. For example, if FedEx stock had recently dropped 40%, then it wouldn't be reasonable to examine the stock from the top down to question how far it might fall from its peak. In order to do that, we need to have a reason to think a stock might be close to its peak (my guideline is within three years of reaching a peak). FedEx's price is about 8% off its recent all-time high, and that high is about 2.5x higher than its peak price in 2008 before the last bear market. I don't see anything here that makes it obvious to me that FedEx couldn't be close to its peak price.Next, let's also look at FedEx's valuation compared to what the market has traditionally valued the stock at. If the valuation is in line or below its historical average, then that might be a reason not to continue our examination, even if the stock has had a good run since 2008.Taking a look at the F.A.S.T. Graphs, we can see that the black line, even after the recent 8% percent decline, is still a little above FedEx's average 10-year P/E ratio of 17.1, represented by the blue line (If we were to expand the chart, the 20-year average P/E is 18.4, which is almost exactly where FedEx is today at 18.5). This doesn't seem to be all that overvalued, and if FedEx were a little less volatile, I might be willing to declare it's not worth closely examining. But what strikes me here is how far the price dives, when it does dive. Notice that this isn't a situation where FedEx's price neatly follows its earnings. It's a situation where FedEx's price likes to overshoot its earnings to both the upside and the downside. That downside overshoot is worth examining so that we can find out if this is just a recent phenomenon, and also how deep of a drop current shareholders might expect if a downturn does happen in the near future.Some of the key factors current FedEx shareholders might want to consider are the speed at which the stock price could fall, how deep the plunge could be, and how long they might expect the stock to stay below the price at which it is today. Over the past 40 years, FedEx has experienced eight sell-offs of 35% or more as depicted in the table below. In addition to those eight, I also included the most recent 2015 sell-off, which was 33%, because it was recent and very close to 35%:*The stock dropped 50% in the first three months but took longer for that last 10% of the drop.I think the most noticeable thing in the data is the sheer number of drawdowns over 35% in a relatively short 40-year period. So far, FedEx has had the most frequent drops of any of the stocks I've examined. It's also worth noting, though, that half of them came in the first 10 years. There have been fewer since 1987, but they have also been longer and deeper on average. And if we don't count the very brief recovery the stock made in 1999, then the pattern is more distinct between pre- and post-1987. If we adjust for 1999, the post-1987 period then has recovery periods in between 5 and 7 years if a recession occurs.The second noticeable thing is the relatively quick drop in price during each drawdown. The market doesn't waste much time punishing FedEx stock if it has any feeling there is an economic slowdown in the forecast.The third notable thing is that FedEx usually doesn't make and maintain all-time highs for very long periods of time, 1994-1997 was the longest at about 4-5 years. We've already passed four years this time around unless we count the 2015 correction, in which case we're nearing two years.Now let's use some the information we've gathered here and put together a risk/reward scenario for FedEx over the medium-term.The goal of the risk/reward analysis is to try to compare FedEx's potential for price appreciation over the medium term (3-5 years) with its potential if the company were to have a down-cycle during that time period. My goal is to find the most optimistic, yet realistic, forecasts and compare them with the historically pessimistic, yet realistic, numbers I presented earlier. I have chosen to use F.A.S.T. Graphs forecasting calculator in order to produce a consistent methodology and one that is independent of my own psychological biases. Let's take a look:What the F.A.S.T. Graphs forecast does is estimate future price appreciation of a stock. It allows you to attach a wide range of P/E multiples to the earnings forecast and calculates future dividends as well. I chose a 21.6 P/E since that was higher than anything we've seen over the past several years, and I will also add the forecasted price gains to FedEx's peak price instead of today's price in order to give us the most optimistic forecast possible over the next three years.The forecasted price gains including dividends are $248.64 (over 24% per year!). If we add that to FedEx's high price of $274.66, we get an expected price of $523.30. Now, the tricky part is how negative we want to be about the potential drawdown if we have a bear market. Since I don't know what type of bear market we might expect, I'm going to give a range based on FedEx's recent past from 1987 onward, which is a 45-72% drawdown range. If the stock falls 45% from those highs we would be looking at $340.15, which isn't a bad spot to be from where we are now. However, if we get the deeper drop, then we are looking at $198.85, which is negative return after 4-5 years.Given the fact we got such a wide range using very optimistic vs. very pessimistic estimates, I am inclined to dial them both back a little bit to make them more realistic. Let's use a future P/E of 19.9 and assume a drawdown of 50%. I think that might give a little sharper and more realistic picture.This would give us a price three years from now of $485.80, and the price after a 50% drawdown of $242.90. Pretty close to right where we are today using more realistic estimates. If I were to tell you that in 4-5 years you'd have almost zero gain in your FedEx stock if we have a bear market during that time period, I'm guessing you wouldn't be all that enthused. However, FedEx, along with John Deere (DE), out of all the cyclical stocks I've covered so far, doesn't seem to be as crazy risky and overvalued as most of the rest (assuming the bear market doesn't begin in the very near future).When I began to write this ""How far can they fall?"" series, I wanted to make sure that I did my best to offer some alternatives for current shareholders other than moving to a cash position for those investors who wanted to remain fully invested or for those who already have a large cash position in their portfolios.For most of the other stocks I've examined in the ""How far could they fall?"" series, I've been recommending a 50/50 mix of the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and the Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU). That mix might be a good alternative to FedEx, too, but I'm a little hesitant to recommend it given the fact FedEx doesn't seem to be overvalued much more than the broader market is. Instead, I would suggest Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B). Here's why:In Warren Buffett's annual letter, he shared a table very similar to the ones I've been using in my ""How far could they fall?"" articles. I have reproduced Mr. Buffett's table below.During the period in question, from 1978 onward, Berkshire has only had three major drawdowns of 35% or more compared to FedEx's eight. Additionally, while Berkshire's drawdowns ranged from 37% to 50%, FedEx's ranged from 38% to 72%. During the last two recessions, FedEx fell 10-20% farther than Berkshire.Currently, Berkshire's price/book ratio is 1.43, which has traditionally been a very good valuation to buy Berkshire. Buffett has said that even if we provide for a margin of safety, a price-to-book of 1.2 would be a good valuation at which to ensure Berkshire was being purchased at a good price. And below that level he is authorized to buy back Berkshire shares. This has been known as ""The Buffett Put.""If nothing were to change with FedEx expect the P/E returning to its 10-year average, then the price would only have to drop about 8% or so. If we assume Berkshire is right around fair value right now (which I do), then it doesn't look like FedEx is all that much overvalued. The key difference has to do with 1) the likelihood of a drawdown, which is clearly in Berkshire's favor over the medium-term, and 2) the fact that FedEx has a history of dipping meaningfully below its historic average P/E, while Berkshire has a theoretical floor should it drop about 15% from its current price (all else being equal). We got a taste of this dynamic in 2015:FDX data by YChartsThere is a point at which Berkshire has a ""floor"" with regard to market sentiment that FedEx doesn't have.The most difficult part of rotating out of FedEx right now would be knowing when to get back in. Most of the time I can work out a fairly good estimate on where that should be, but FedEx has a pretty wide range of how far it can fall depending on what type of correction we are having. In cases like this, it might be best to simply base the point of when to rotate back into FedEx on the spread between it and Berkshire. Something around 15% seems like a reasonable target to me, though I'm not sure if that is enough of an incentive for longer-term FedEx shareholders to rotate out if they have to pay taxes on their FedEx gains. For an investor in a tax-sheltered account, I think they would have a high probability of increasing their FedEx shares by 15% at virtually no additional cost over the medium-term.FedEx is a great business and the stock is only slightly overvalued right now. However, it has historically been subject to a lot of volatility, and during recessions, it is prone to deep drawdowns and fairly slow recovery periods of 5-7 years. Analysts have forecasted in strong growth for FedEx over the next three years. FedEx's price tends to drop rapidly when the business cycle turns, and given the high expectations on the part of analysts right now, I would expect the price to drop very quickly if the market outlook becomes less positive. While there are certainly many stocks in the market right now that are more overvalued than FedEx, I still think Berkshire Hathaway has a high probability of outperforming by at least 15% over the medium term."
4147633,104122,2018-02-16T12:13:08-05:00,"Package delivery stocks UPS and FedEx experienced a stock price decline as news that Amazon would enter the delivery business raised concerns over potential revenue decreases and stock price devaluation.UPS and FedEx are likely to experience only a temporary stock price headwind as both companies derive marginal amounts of revenue from Amazon, have far more sophisticated delivery operations, and will benefit from increased revenue growth opportunities.FedEx offers a more attractive investment opportunity than UPS as FedEx has better financials, higher year-over-year revenue growth, and offers a more appealing value proposition.","Source: FedEx Plane ImagePackage delivery stocks United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) plummeted in early February as news that Amazon (AMZN) would be instituting its own delivery service sent share prices tumbling. AMZN released plans to implement its own package delivery service as well as provide item delivery services to other platforms and businesses. This had an overwhelmingly negative impact on UPS and FDX's share price which were depressed by 20% and 15%, respectively. At face value, this recent revelation is disconcerting but further analysis reveals that the threat of AMZN on the package delivery industry is not as distressing as one would initially anticipate.The threat of AMZN to UPS and FedEx is not concerning. Amazon has merely implemented pilot delivery operations in Los Angeles, the company's delivery service comes nowhere close to the complex, far-reaching, and highly developed delivery operations of FDX and UPS. UPS and FDX also derive only a relatively small percentage of revenues from AMZN. Although 2016 figures make AMZN UPS's single largest customer, contributing $1 billion to top-line revenue, UPS derives its remaining $59 billion worth of revenue from other sources. If AMZN were to cease doing business with UPS this would result in only a 1.67% decrease in revenue. FedEx has a similarly low revenue weighting in AMZN related sales, obtaining just 3% of revenues from AMZN. The delivery companies' low revenue weighting in AMZN related sales is likely a result of razor-thin margins imposed by Bezos who negotiated shipping discounts of more than 70%. In the unlikely event that AMZN fully transitions to its own delivery service, UPS and FDX would compensate for revenue losses with rising e-commerce shipping volumes in the United States. According to Statista, e-commerce retail shipping sales of physical goods in the U.S are set to increase 40% over the next four years. FDX and UPS are set to monopolize increased shipping volumes as retailers are unequipped to handle package distribution - they do not have the logistics capabilities, decades of experience, and global distribution network of reputed carriers FDX and UPS.AMZN's inclination to fully develop its own delivery service is improbable or distant, given extensive cost, time, and organizational limitations. To fully scale AMZN's own delivery service would require significant capital expenditures on distribution centers, planes, vehicles, lease space at airports, etc. AMZN also would have to increase its workforce to twice its current size to execute delivery operations. Even if AMZN were to achieve this, margins within the shipping business are not attractive and would not warrant such large capital expenditures.Some have expressed concerns over AMZN's potential drone delivery service, but realize FDX and UPS are both exploring innovative delivery initiatives ranging from drones to robotic delivery systems. UPS and FDX have been around for multiple decades - both companies know the in's and out's of the shipping business allowing them to contend with the toughest competitive developments. Despite current market pessimism, package delivery stocks have an optimistic outlook due to their defensive nature, elevated future shipping volumes, and high competitor barriers to entry.Despite FDX's and UPS's optimistic outlook, both companies are susceptible to the following headwinds.Although FDX and UPS demonstrate potential headwinds in the aforementioned areas, these impediments are unlikely to be unduly problematic. Security breaches ordinarily only result in temporary stock dips, foreign currency translations is always an issue for business' engaging in global operations, continued cost optimization initiatives will improve margins, and it is unlikely that the U.S will slide into a bear market during the current Republican administration.So If you are interested in buying package delivery stocks the next question that arises is whether to buy FDX or UPS?Balance SheetSource: FDX Debt to EquityIncome Statement FDX is a better buy based on the company's revenue growth over the past couple years. FDX’s total revenues experienced year-over-year respective increases of 7%, 8.5%, 16% over 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017. During the same time period UPS only experienced revenue increases of 4%, 4%, and 3.7%.Value PropositionAlthough the FDX and UPS evaluation is higher than the air freight and cargo industry as well as the S&P 500, FedEx appears to be more reasonably valued than UPS. FDX's PEG ratio, price to book, price to cash flow, price to sales, and cash flow per share ratios are more attractive than UPS.Source: UPS/FDX Value ComparisonGrowthAlthough FDX maintains an advantage in other categories, UPS has boasted astronomically high return on equity of 477.77% as compared to FDX's ROE of 20.56%. UPS' high returns are a result of extensive share buybacks as well as dividend paymentsDividend Consideration UPS unwavering focus on investor relations is almost to a fault. UPS's cash flow is monopolized by dividend payments, and the company's current 3.38% dividend yield monopolizes 59% of net profit as compared to FDX whose dividend payment of 0.83 comprises only 17% of net income.FDX's better financials, increased year-over-year revenue growth, and more attractive value proposition make the stock a better buy than UPS. UPS and FDX stock headwinds are comparable to the market's overreaction to retail stocks when AMZN's increasing popularity sent retail stock prices falling for the greater part of 2017 before stock prices eventually restabilized as investors rationalized little merit to previous pessimistic concerns. Although FDX's stock price may slide slightly further in lieu of recent security vulnerabilities and expansionary efforts, FDX's stock price depression is likely to be only temporary as investors reconcile the stocks' defensive outlook and growth opportunities. If you feel inclined to buy FDX, it may be advantageous to buy the stock now at its current discounted evaluation or dollar cost average into the stock over the coming weeks.Author's note: Thanks for reading.

4182711,50291,2018-06-20T00:54:03-04:00,"Lead times force Boeing to focus on freighter sales.Health of cargo market leads to robust demand for freighters.Absence of next generation freighter makes the Boeing 777F a desired aircraft, which is a very efficient freighter.","So far this year, Boeing (BA) is having a strong start looking at its financial results, but also when looking at the order book, the jet maker is seeing some appreciable order inflow. One of the programs that could use some order inflow to avoid a further cut in production is the Boeing 777 program. In this report, we explain why Boeing depends on the freighter variant of the Boeing 777 more than on the passenger variant to fill up many of remaining delivery slots in the coming years.Source: BoeingOne reason why Boeing will depend on the Boeing 777F for continued order inflow is because with rising oil prices, the appeal of the Boeing 777-300ER versus the Boeing 777X starts fading while airlines will await in-service performance data for the Boeing 777X to commit to any purchases. Additionally, there is no replacement cycle for the Boeing 777-300ER kicking in until after 2020. This means that any order inflow has to come from airlines that need some near-term capacity expansion.In 2018, the only customer for the Boeing 777-300ER has been Lufthansa (OTCQX:DLAKF) which ordered 2 aircraft for Swiss International Air Lines.The easiest way for jet makers to fill delivery slots is by giving hefty discounts. By doing so, it becomes a little bit more attractive to order the aircraft that is less efficient compared to its successor. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) used this to add 18 Boeing 777-300ERs to its fleet at a price that we estimated to be 15% lower than the normal sales price.Discounting has boundaries, since the jet maker does want to book profits on assembly and it also does not want to cause a pricing pressure on the successor of the aircraft. Additionally, the time frame is very important as well. For big passenger aircraft, orders have to be placed around 18 months in advance in order for the supply chain to be able to deliver on time. Especially for seat makers, this lead time is needed. What this means is that a passenger aircraft ordered today will be delivered at the earliest in early 2020. With there being some slots available in 2020 and possibly 2019, the window for passenger aircraft to fill those slots is closing. Freighters have a lead time of roughly a year giving Boeing some extra months to secure the orders. So the fact that Boeing seems to be getting more freighter orders partially has to do with the fact that due to the short time between order and the delivery slot, the Boeing 777F is the only aircraft that can still fill the earlier delivery slots.What drives orders for the Boeing 777F is the upward trajectory of the cargo market. The market for cargo aircraft is materially different from the passenger aircraft market with the same underlying drivers, namely economic growth, but other replacement and growth cycles. What is currently driving the market is e-commerce and pharmaceuticals and that is a trend that is likely continuing in the coming years. So after a few very soft years for the cargo market, growth has been picking up and additional aircraft can be absorbed by cargo airlines.Up until May, ANA and Lufthansa Cargo each bought 2 Boeing 777F aircraft while an unidentified customer ordered 3 aircraft. Qatar Airways has committed to buying 5 more aircraft.While preparing this report, Boeing announced an order from FedEx (FDX) for 12 Boeing 777Fs.Source: AeroExpoWhat also plays a role in the Boeing 777F sales being robust is the fact that there is no next generation freighter available. Cargo aircraft operate at a lower utilization rate, which means that cost efficiency is more driven by lower acquisition costs than by fuel costs. In the future, there likely will be a next generation freighter available, but at this very moment, the Boeing 777F is a very capable and efficient freighter.The Boeing 777F is currently playing an important role in filling the Boeing 777 delivery slots and we expect more orders soon. This is caused by robust demand for cargo aircraft, the absence of a strong alternative and the absence of a next generation freighter as well as common lead times that prevent the Boeing 777-300ER from filling the earliest available delivery slots. E-commerce and a growing market for pharmaceuticals transport will likely continue to support growth of the cargo market in the absence of trade war eruption, and the longer it takes Boeing to secure orders for the passenger variants of the Boeing 777, the more it will have to rely on order inflow for the freighter variant. Important to understand that the order inflow is a combination of a strong market as well as the partial inability to sell the passenger variant.This report has been rolled out to premium subscribers earlier. As we were preparing to submit the report for regular subscribers, Boeing announced that FedEx bought 24 freighters including 12 Boeing 777Fs comfirming our thesis. The report has been altered (in italics where appropriate). The orders will be added to Boeing's order overview when finalized.

4179247,85096,2018-06-04T13:06:18-04:00,"FedEx total return over-performed the DOW average for my 53.0-month test period by 35.50%, which is good.FedEx three-year forward CAGR of 11% is good and will give you good growth with the increasing world economy and population.FedEx dividends are below average at 0.8% and have been increased for 10 of the past ten years.","FedEx (FDX), one of the largest transportation e-commerce and business services companies, is a buy for the total return investor. FedEx has steady growth and has plenty of cash, which it uses to buy bolt-on companies, increase the dividend each year, and buy back shares. The company is being reviewed using The Good Business Portfolio guidelines, my IRA portfolio of good business companies that are balanced among all styles of investing.When I scanned the five-year chart, FedEx has exhibited strong performance for four of the past five years, with 2015 down a little in a poor market. The recent sideways price action provides a buying opportunity to buy a quality company at a fair price.FDXYChartsFundamentals of FedEx will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.FedEx passes 10 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. FedEx beats against the Dow baseline in my 53.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 53.0-month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 85.36% makes FedEx a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. FDX has a below average dividend yield of 0.8% and has had increases for ten years making FDX a poor choice for the dividend growth investor but the total return more than makes up for the low dividend. The Dividend is estimated to be increased in June 2018 to $0.60/Qtr. from $0.50/Qtr. or a 20% increase.DOW's 53.0-month total return baseline is 49.86%For the last quarter on March 20, 2018, FedEx reported earnings that beat expected by $.61 at $3.72, compared to last year at $2.35. Total revenue was higher at $16.5 Billion more than a year ago by 10.0% year over year and beat expected revenue by $350 Million. This was a great report with bottom line beating expected and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out June 2018 and is expected to be $5.68 compared to last year at $4.25 a good increase.FedEx is one of the largest transportation, e-commerce and business services company in the United States and foreign countries.As per Reuters,Overall FedEx is a great business with 11% CAGR projected growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing demand for FDX's services. The strong earnings and revenue growth provides FDX the capability to continue its growth as the business increases by buying bolt companies and foreign expansion.The FED has kept interest rates low for some years, and on March 21 they raised the base rate up 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will not raise the rates three more times this year, but will go slow at 1-2x for the rest of 2018, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The recent market volatility may slow down the FED.From March 20, 2018, earnings call Fred Smith (Chief Executive Officer and Chairman) saidThis shows the feelings of top management to the continued growth of the FedEx business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. FDX has good constant growth and will continue as the world economy grows.FedEx is a great investment choice for the total return investor and steadily growing dividend as an extra. FedEx will definitely be considered for The Good Business Portfolio when cash is available. If you want a growing dividend income and great total return, in growing package shipping business, FDX may be the right investment for you.I was considering selling the small position in Kraft Heinz Corp. (KHC) that is 0.5% of the portfolio because of its bad performance, and I have better companies for investment. The last earnings showed growth, so I will wait another quarter to see if this continues.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is 8.0% of the portfolio, Altria (MO) is 6.8% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.8% of the portfolio and Boeing is 13.9% of the portfolio, therefore BA, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position with Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter earnings were fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year another good report. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. I just can't bring myself to sell any more Boeing.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did not like it. JNJ has announced a dividend increase to $0.90/Qtr. which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure. Take this recent drop to pick up a great company in the medical products field.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 1st Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4146349,103738,2018-02-13T20:35:33-05:00,"Amazon is rumored to enter the shipping industry with its own delivery methods, to be specified at a later date.For companies like FedEx this is an incredible headwind, as sales growth and share price appreciation are reliant on e-commerce shipping volume growth, with Amazon leading.I believe Amazon's foray into the industry can save it $2 billion in annual expenses and has high consequences for FedEx's future growth, which is already stagnating.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has enjoyed a run of a lifetime as institutions began piling into the stock over the course of 2016 and 2017 in hopes to reap the rewards of online shipping as consumer spending habits shift to order from home.Over the better part of the last decade, companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) have enjoyed the shift in consumer spending to online purchasing, alongside most brick and mortar retailers who have invested heavily in an e-commerce business segment like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and others.In recent months, Amazon has been prioritizing expanding its own platform rather than outsourcing or using third-party companies, venturing into different markets like content creation, electronics, grocery delivery and more recently the shipping business. On Friday, a report surfaced that the company is rumored to utilize its present locations, including bookstores and Whole Foods locations, to provide its own shipping services and compete with the likes of USPS, FedEx and UPS (UPS), hurting the stocks' performance. This move is hardly a surprise given the volume of shipments and large fulfillment center presence, allowing it to easily cut shipping time and reliance on a third party for its guaranteed shipping. The financial aspect of organically expanding shipping bodes well for the company as well, as I review shipping and investment margins in a later segment, as it continues and looks to diversify its revenue streams as it grows into an online conglomerate. After reporting $178 billion in net sales for the year, a 31% increase over 2016, and operating income of $3 billion, a 28% rise over 2016, it is looking for some diversification in higher margin market segments to sustain the high growth rate.Amazon is in a unique situation where it generates the majority of its cash from its AWS platform ($4.3 billion), offsetting the collective $225 million loss from its North America and International products business, where the former generated almost $2.9 billion in net income but the latter a $3.06 billion loss. As the company works on improving overall shipping costs, which totaled over $20 billion in 2017, it makes sense for it to look for more efficient ways to reduce costs where a 10% improvement saves the company $2 billion in expenses, using its large cash position to cover the initial investment in ground and air shipping including trucks, planes and even drones.(Author Note: Data found in 10K, page 27)Even though comparing FedEx's shipping margins with Amazon's potential ones is rather speculative at this point, given the nature of both businesses and the lack of details on the scope of Amazon's penetration, I believe some similarities are present in both business models. For example, FedEx had an 8.3% operating profit margin in 2017, which was well over Amazon's 2.5%, yet it remains a highly diverse company with multiple transportation and shipping revenue streams. For 2017, the company recorded operating margin growth primarily from cost-cutting measures and a look at shipping volumes reveals a 3.8% increase in the company's overall shipping, where domestic ground transportation accounted for the highest rise, matching online shipping trends seen from the likes of Amazon.In early 2017, FedEx implemented a 3.9% increase to its shipping rates to accommodate rising fees and fuel prices after jet fuel costs rose from $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion for the year. On the flip side, Amazon lowered its overall shipping prices (averaged per unit) to remain competitive and accommodate the growth it was seeing in shipping unit volume and competing retail sites.As FedEx owns 598 aircraft, given the high capacity of operations, it's not clear what type of investment Amazon is going to make for its domestic or international shipping platform, given its high presence in urban markets with both its bookstores and Whole Foods locations. The financial side, however, is a clear winner for Amazon as it enters into a higher margin market where it can leverage the growth of its overall business to make its shipping segment just profitable enough to boost its competitive advantage.(Author Note: Fuel costs found on page 10, aircraft ownership on page 20)Alongside other plays in the content creation, electronics and grocery delivery markets, the company's foray into shipping can be done at a much more efficient rate. Given that big shipping companies like FedEx have old fuel-inefficient aircraft and old delivery methods, it has the opportunity to enter the market as a new player in a much more efficient manner, like the rumored use of drones and electric (and in the future, autonomous) vehicles which will dramatically improve margins and allow for the company to lower shipping prices further. I believe that a 10% improvement in margins can translate into over $2 billion in cost savings, which can either be taken as cash to further investments or be leveraged to reduce current shipping prices further. With a company like Amazon, it can afford to make a slim margin given the high volume of units sold.A $2 billion annual savings can cover an initial investment of 10 new Boeing (BA) 777-300ER and 100 electric trucks (Daimler FUSO (OTCPK:DMLRY) or Tesla Semi (NASDAQ:TSLA) when it's released, or equivalent) in a time frame of 3-4 years and is easily executable with its current cash position of over $20 billion in cash and equivalents.As the company was one of the hot investments in 2016 and 2017 with institutions piling into the stock for the e-commerce play, avoiding exposure to single retail names, the stock appreciated over 45% since the beginning of the year, easily outpacing the market or any company-guided growth numbers.Amazon, which ships well over 100M units per year through various shipping companies (author estimate), accounts for significant growth in the company's business. This comes alongside Amazon's unique advantage - If you shop for the Nordstrom Edelman petty boot, you'll pay around $99 both on the Nordstrom website (using FedEx or equivalent) and on Amazon, but with Amazon you're not paying for shipping and on Nordstrom.com you pay $22.17 which hikes the overall price. In this case, you'll be moving shipping business from large existing companies to Amazon, reducing demand for large established companies like FedEx.This is not to say that FedEx relies only on retail, but a heavy amount of its business and growth have come from the shift to online purchasing. As the company expects EPS to increase 9.92% and 25.37% in 2018 and 2019, respectively, it only expects sales to increase 7.13% and 4.9% for the same periods. This is accomplished by aggressive cost-cutting, investments in operational efficiency and fuel cost hedges, in both directions. However, the company expects sales to slow significantly, which I believe will underperform once Amazon fully establishes its presence in the shipping market, reducing FedEx's unit volumes.Looking at Amazon, I believe it is headed in the right direction with its foray into different markets that both enhance its overall offerings, which drive Prime membership, and boosts efficiency within its respective segments. Its rumored foray into the shipping market can yield a significant improvement over its current methods as it spent over $20 billion in 2017 on shipping its goods and services around the globe, mostly with free shipping. I do believe that this is a market disruptor with well over 100M units shipped annually by the company and will not only cover the initial investment in infrastructure of vehicles and planes but can sustain its free shipping offering, attracting more business from competing retail sites.From the FedEx perspective, I believe the company is well established within local and global markets to sustain its low single-digit growth rates for the time being. But given it has grown quite substantially from the recent e-commerce boom, I don't believe it will continue to outperform peers and the market moving forward once (and if) Amazon launches its own shipping platform, reducing domestic volumes by a significant amount. With the company currently trading at 17x 2018 earnings estimates, I believe it is fairly valued and has high doubts about further price outperformance moving forward.Overall, this is an overwhelming plus for Amazon and a significant headwind for companies like FedEx and UPS (including USPS). I remain optimistic about Amazon's future growth and skeptical on FedEx's and UPS's performance."
4177668,103711,2018-05-28T14:49:14-04:00,"FedEx can be argued to be one of the principal beneficiaries of e-commerce.With large global reach, FedEx should continue to benefit from the increased package delivery demand.Dividend growth is strongly supported by robust earnings growth.Shares have 40% upside to my fair value estimate.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has seen a strong history of growth, and the growing trend of e-commerce provides tailwinds to ensure that this growth continues well into the future. For the high-quality growth it offers, FDX is way too cheap at 16 times earnings and has 40% upside.Shares of FDX have greatly outperformed the broader market over the last five years:Yahoo FinanceWhy was this the case? What is the strategy running its wheels?FDX benefits from strong tailwinds, including growing GDP as well as growing consumer wallets and industrial spending:2018 Roadshow PresentationFDX provides services to over 220 countries and territories including every address in the U.S. It accomplishes this with over 660 aircrafts and 170,000 motorized vehicles, but most noteworthy is its FedEx Onsite initiative in which the company partners with retailers such as Albertsons, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), and Kroger (NYSE:KR) to allow customers to pick up and drop off prelabeled packages. The company recently signed a new agreement with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to add FedEx to 500 locations in the next two years. The end result? 80% of Americans are now within 9 minutes of a FedEx hold location. This is one example of the strong innovation seen here as these hold stations have significantly lower operating costs (while increasing convenience for both retailers and their customers).The two most important business segments for FDX are FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which combined make up 87% of revenues:2018 Roadshow PresentationThese are the two segments we will focus on.FedEx Express refers to the company's air freight division, which is the largest express transportation company in the world. Its main strategies here are to grow the network, find new revenue-generating customers, and cut costs.In the FY18 third quarter, the Express segment saw 9% revenue growth.It continues to see strong package demand and pricing domestically:FY18 Q3 PresentationAs well as internationally:FY18 Q3 PresentationBut most of the earnings growth from this segment is more due to increased yields on packages rather than increased packages overall, indicating pricing power:FY18 Q3 Earnings ReleaseI should note that the increase in operating income from 2015 to 2017 appears to have significant contribution from the drop-off in oil prices (shown from 2017 to 2015, in millions):2017 10-KHowever, it isn't as simple as rising oil prices = rising oil costs because FDX does receive fuel surcharges. The percentage trends as compared to revenues show that the company has seen some challenges in maintaining these surcharges:Chart by Author, data from 2017 10-KIf the price of fuel begins to rise quicker than its fuel surcharges, Express may see significant rising costs. I however do not believe that the price of oil will come anywhere near the highs in 2015 and have confidence that the company's operational growth will more than make up for any rising fuel costs. Furthermore, FDX deserves credit for investing heavily into aircraft equipment ($1.8 billion in FY17) as its new B767F planes carry almost as much payload as the replaced MD10 but is 30% more fuel efficient.The greatest competitor to FedEx is undoubtedly UPS (UPS). That said, FedEx has been running circle around its competitor as FedEx Ground is much faster:2018 Roadshow PresentationThis has led to very persistent and rapid growth in market share:2018 Roadshow PresentationIn FY18 Q3, powered by 5% average revenue growth per package, FedEx Ground saw a robust 11% revenue growth:FY18 Q3 PresentationFDX's strong execution has led to strong adjusted EPS growth:2018 Roadshow PresentationIn my book, earnings are the fundamental backing for all share price appreciation. Now we know the secret to its success.FDX as of its last earnings release had $16 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. This was 1.9 times EBITDA in 2017, which is a reasonable amount of leverage considering the highly recurring nature of the business.FDX has increased dividends for the past 16 consecutive years:Chart by author, data from FedEx websiteThe $2 dividend payout represents a 13% payout ratio based on forward earnings. I anticipate the dividend to continue growing rapidly as it will be supported by both earnings growth and potentially an increased return of capital to shareholders.After repurchasing $2.7 billion of stock in 2016, repurchases slowed down to $509 million in 2017. I do anticipate buybacks to speed up moving forward.FDX is guiding for adjusted EPS of $15.00 to $15.40 in 2018. The strong guidance is attributed to favorable tax rates both domestically and internationally as well as strong operations (as we have seen). With shares trading around $250, they trade at just 16.4 times earnings. I believe a more reasonable multiple is 23.5 times earnings, which implies a share price of $357 and 42% upside.I need to point out that FDX reinvests heavily back into the business, with $5.1 billion in capital expenditures in 2017 versus $4.9 billion in cash from operations. Management estimates that 40% of its estimated $5.9 billion 2018 capital expenditures to be growth related (non-recurring). Investors are trusting management to allocate the capital appropriately. So far its ability to increase revenue and impose pricing power suggests that the trust is well placed.FDX is a well-run company which is helping the world move towards e-commerce. In spite of the impressive historical growth, I believe it has more room to run.

4132849,92986,2017-12-19T17:29:49-05:00,FedEx is one of the best macro stocks on the market which is currently benefiting from an accelerating US economy and strong consumer sentiment.FedEx's business model is perfectly exploiting the market while pushing sales to new highs.Buy this low volatility alpha stock on dips.,"Most stocks I trade have a high correlation to a certain macro theme. FedEx (FDX) is one of those companies. Hence these stocks are more predictable and better trading tools. In this article, I will explain why this company is a great buy and a stock that should be in every trader's toolbox, so to speak. Source: FedExI've mentioned it probably a dozen times but it is always important to say it again: Transportation companies are the very core of every economy. A strong economy means strong shipments while a weak economy means weak shipments. It is as simple as it gets. The difficult thing is to spot economic trends and determine whether it still makes sense to buy transportation stocks. That's why I added the graph below. This graph shows you two lines. The blue line displays leading shipments sentiment. This index is an average of shipments indices from various regional surveys that are published throughout the month. Leading means that this data predicts business activities in the shipments sector. The orange line displays the year-on-year performance of FedEx's stock price. What we see is that the stock is up roughly 30% compared to one year ago. This also means that the stock could easily reach $280 over the next couple of months without being overheated. Especially because shipments sentiment is at its highest level since the early 2000s(!). Source: Author's Spreadsheets (Raw data: Regional Manufacturing Surveys) And just to be clear, my $280 target is still quite conservative. Based on the shipments indicator it would be possible to go as high as $300 over the next few months. The second graph I'm about to show you compares the same stock price performance to the leading ISM manufacturing index. This index covers the entire manufacturing sector and is the best indicator to predict the US economy. That being said, even though we are a bit below this year's highs we are still at above-average levels. Source: Author's Spreadsheets (Raw data: Regional Manufacturing Surveys) The second thing I have to mention is the fact that not every steep uptrend ends with a steep downtrend. Most economic expansions stay at above-average levels for some time until sentiment starts falling. We are currently in the mature stage of the expansion which means that returns are likely to be above average but not as high as a few months ago. Furthermore, the comparison to the ISM manufacturing index suggests that my $280 target is very likely. FedEx is depending on consumer sentiment unlike Union Pacific which transports a lot of raw materials (for example). That's why consumer sentiment and retail spending are key. FedEx mentioned that they expect a 2.6% consumer spending increase in 2018.Consumer sentiment is currently breaking out and at the highest levels since the early 2000s. This is supported by strong economic growth, rising housing and stock market prices and a (hopefully) lower tax rate in the near future. Source: University of MichiganNow let's look what the result has been of rock-solid leading economic sentiment. Both total retail sales and non-store retail sales are soaring. Total retail sales have accelerated to more than 6% while non-store retail sales growth is almost at 11% after hitting lows close to 3% shortly after the 2014 slowdown. It's almost too easy for retail companies and transportation companies as you are about to see. So, what has all of this economic growth done to FedEx? I added the ISM index to the revenue history to make the macro picture a bit clearer. What we see is that sales have gone up from $9 billion per quarter in 2009 to more than $15 billion in the latest quarter. Note that this is just months after a massive acceleration in the first quarter of 2016. FDX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe revenue growth trend is supported by all key segments. In January 2018, FedEx will implement a 4.9% shipping rate hike on FedEx Express, Ground, and Freight services. This will increase revenues even further given that the economic trend remains strong.One might say that FedEx is not a no-brainer after gaining 30% on a YTD basis. I would have to agree with one exception: The stock is in a perfect environment and there is no reason why the uptrend could die any moment. The stock is trading at 22 times earnings and 15 times next year's earnings. This is exactly the kind of valuation one can expect from a mature company in a strong environment. You will see the same thing when you look at the stock price and the ratio spread (blue line) between FedEx and the transportation ETF (IYT). Not only are you buying a strong transportation stock, you also are likely buying an outperformer. This stock gives you exposure to US consumer and economic growth in general while providing you with low volatility and high alpha. I would therefore advise that buying on dips is the best thing to do to ride the current bull market.Stay tuned!Thank you for reading my article. Please let me know what you think of my thesis. Your input is highly appreciated!"
4129169,21151,2017-12-02T09:04:32-05:00,"FedEx is growing through acquisitions; its purchase of TNT Express establishes more grounds in Europe.While its yield is under 1%, FedEx is part of the Dividend Achievers with over 10 years of consecutive increases.FDX has a good appetite for growth by acquisition.","I really like when I find a dividend-paying company evolving into an oligopoly. Their market is almost secure and price trends are predictable. FexEx (FDX) is one of these companies. Because the company benefits from cost advantages, efficient scale, and a network effect, FDX should not be bothered by new competitors anytime soon. I also appreciate FDX's appetite for growth by acquisition. Its only downside is probably its very low dividend yield. In fact, I don't think any regular dividend investors would even consider it. It's a good thing I'm not the ""Regular"" Guy... but rather The Dividend Guy, huh? Let's look if FDX could be such a good company that it will make you forget its low yield.FedEx is one of those companies that doesn't need a presentation. The business model is quite simple; you have something you want to ship on the other side of the coast, you call FedEx or UPS (UPS). The reason why there is only two players in the goods shipping service in the U.S. is because there used to be three and one left (DHL). The simple fact that DHL, a reputed international shipping company, dropped the ball and exited the market in 2009 shows you how FDX and UPS have mastered the art of shipping. While UPS is bigger in terms of market cap and revenue (slightly), FDX is a strong #2. FedEx has developed an important network enabling overnight shipping at various locations.Source: FedExSource: YChartsIn addition to naturally growing as the population consumes more, FedEx also counts on e-commerce growth and acquisitions to increase its revenue. Last year, the company purchased the European shipping company, TNT Express, for €4.4 billion. You can clearly see the impact of the FDX acquisition when you compare the revenue growth with UPS:Source: YChartsSource: YChartsFedEx's latest quarter hasn't been a success in terms of earnings mainly because its latest acquisition got hacked. This unfortunate event is believed to have cut $300 million from earnings in the last quarter. As the company is busy integrating TNT and digesting the cyber-attack losses, management reviewed its FY 2018 earnings lower to $12-12.80 while analysts expected $13.38.I think this is more like a short-term bummer than anything else. FDX will continue to grow its business with the help of e-commerce and an international presence. There is nothing changing the long-term perspective of this company for now.While FDX doesn't offer a great yield, it has still increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years. This makes it part of the elite Dividend Achievers list. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least 10 consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YChartsOn top of not offering an interesting yield for years, FDX only started to take its dividend growth policy seriously in 2014. Since January 1, 2014, the company increased its payout by 233.30%.Source: YChartsYou can tell the dividend payment hasn't been a major commitment to FDX's management for years. This could be explained by FDX's appetite to grow through acquisitions. After all, the best use of money should be within the company, not outside. Maybe management now thinks that dividend payments should be increased. It will be interesting to see what it is up to in the next couple of years. With a payout ratio of 15%, the company could easily continue its double-digit growth rate for a decade. FDX has everything to meet my 7 dividend growth principles. It only has to continue this streak.I think the cyber-attack on TNT Express shows how a company that relies on efficient algorithms to maintain its edge against the competition could get hurt. While it will not destroy the company, I think it's fair to assume that other attacks could hurt earnings eventually. The good news is that it will always remain a ""non-recurring event"" in its financial statements.The integration of TNT may also hurt margins over time. The fact that many employees are part of the union may reduce FedEx's legendary flexibility.As the market keeps going up, do you think FDX is overvalued? Let's take a look at its PE history over the past decade:Source: YChartsThe company's forward PE has been on the rise. This leads me to think that the market is very bullish for FDX.Unfortunately, the DDM model isn't exactly the best way to determine if FDX is fairly priced. I decided to use it nonetheless to see which kind of metrics would allow a fair valuation.Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.As I mentioned in the dividend perspective segment, I believe FDX can (and will) maintain a double-digit dividend growth for the next 10 years. Since the company is evolving in a duopoly, there is no reason why it couldn't sustain a 7% dividend growth rate afterward. You may just have found the next company that will pay you a 2-3% yield with a strong growth perspective.About two months ago, I decided to go with UPS. The rationale behind my purchase has been explained at Dividend Growth Rocks. I still think FDX is a good investment and has definitely growth potential. However, I would rather remain with a company paying a higher yield and whose dividend growth policy is well defined.Seriously, if you made it this far, it's because you liked what you read.

4182969,50291,2018-06-21T00:56:22-04:00,Order supports continued fleet growth driven by demand and fleet renewal.More orders can be expected in the future.Boeing 767F and Boeing 777F are proven efficient freighters.,"Yesterday The Boeing Company (BA) announced that FedEx (FDX) would be acquiring a total of 24 aircraft including orders for the Boeing 777F, which validated the thesis on a report we sent out to subscribers hours before. In this report, we had a look at the order, what it means and how many aircraft FedEx has on order with Boeing and Airbus.Source: BoeingAlthough the deal is still pending finalization, Boeing and FedEx have reached an agreement for the sale of 12 medium freighters and 12 large freighters. FedEx Express will buy 12 Boeing 767F aircraft and 12 Boeing 777Fs. The Boeing 767Fs will be delivered between 2019 and 2022 filling some of the vacant slots, while the Boeing 777Fs will be delivered from 2020 until 2025.At list prices the orders are valued at $6.6B, but after customary discounts AeroAnalysis estimated the actual value of the contract to be closer $2.75B.Source: BoeingThe order is a sign of continued strength of the cargo market. Driven by demand for shipping of pharmaceuticals and e-commerce, the market is expected to continue growing. Albeit the growth rate of the air cargo market of 4-5 percent this year does not match last year’s 10 percent, demand remains in a strong upward trajectory.In 2015, FedEx was one of the first airlines committing to new cargo aircraft as the cargo market showed the first signs of recovery. Partly there was need for FedEx Express to order new aircraft since it had an aging fleet. Not ordering aircraft early would mean that FedEx would have to serve the growing market with older aircraft, which is not very cost efficient. On the other hand, the order for 50 Boeing 767 aircraft showed a lot of confidence in the cargo market.When FedEx ordered 50 aircraft it also acquired options for another 50 aircraft. In July 2015, 46 orders for the Boeing 767F from FedEx were added to Boeing’s order book. It is possible that some orders placed shortly before and shortly after the announcement were all part of the 50 firm plus 50 options deal.Out of the 50 options, FedEx has now firmed 18 as 6 were already firmed in 2016 and the latest commitment firms another 12 options. So the order should not come as a total surprise as the market is growing nicely and it fits the orders and options that FedEx agreed on with Boeing in 2015.Also for Boeing this is a sign of strength. Boeing has recently seen an uptick in order activity for freighters and the way Boeing benefits from that shows how strong they are on that market. While there usually is a duopoly on the aircraft market, on the cargo aircraft market Airbus does not come even close to Boeing.The most recent commitment would bring the unfilled orders for FedEx Express to 83: 65 medium freighter and 18 large freighters. Important to note is that even with the additional commitments and the options, the carrier does not have enough orders to cover fleet renewal and growth.The most recent commitment from FedEx Express fits our view that the Boeing 777 program will depend on the order inflow for the freighter variant, partly driven by the strong market but also due to the lead times which are shorter for the Boeing 777F.The order is not a total surprise given the market’s upward trajectory and FedEx’ previous commitment that included 50 options for the Boeing 767F. Given how strong the market currently is and the absence of competition for Boeing, we expect FedEx to firm all options and place additional orders with Boeing in the future."
4131035,96186,2017-12-11T09:47:26-05:00,"Warren Buffett has said dividends don’t matter, in part, because we can make our own distributions by selling a few shares at pre-set intervals. But, is he right?There is something reassuring about dividends, especially during periods of panic. What happens if we have to sell shares during a financial crisis?This note explores these questions by comparing the performance of UPS and FedEx.","I like dividends. During the financial crisis, I took solace from my quarterly payments, which were far more predictable than the wildly fluctuating share prices.But am I fooling myself? Warren Buffett has suggested dividends don’t matter, arguing we can manufacture our own dividends by selling a few shares at set intervals. When we take a dividend payment in cash, we are effectively foregoing the opportunity to reinvest the payment in new shares. Theoretically at least, manufacturing the dividend has the same effect. In both cases, our investment in the company is reduced by the dividend, compared to what it would have been if we had not taken a payment.MIT professors Modigliani and Miller have made the same point, suggesting that in a world with no transaction costs and no investment taxes, dividends do not matter. In the real world, where these twin menaces are here to stay, dividends should be a net negative. Cash retained and reinvested in the business is not subject to dividend taxes and incurs no transaction costs.Yet, in the real-world dividend policy matters and can have a material impact on stock prices. Shares will often tank when dividends are cut, and rise after an increase. In the real-world, investors care about dividends, and they care a lot.Many people view dividends as a salary of sorts, believing that, if they keep their spending below their dividend income, they will not outspend their savings in retirement. They see dividend increases as raises and loathe managers who cut their payouts. Some companies, like Realty Income Corporation (O), wrap their value proposition around the dividend, referring to themselves as “The Monthly Dividend Company.”Who is right?This note explores the dividend question by comparing the performance of United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express (FDX). Both companies operate in the same industry, have reputations for being well managed, and benefit from the same secular trends in e-commerce and globalization - but UPS has consistently traded at a higher yield.In retrospect, we know FedEx has generated exceptional returns over time, but its stock price has been much more volatile than UPS, dropping sharply during recessions, and soaring during periods of recovery. My primary interest was to see just how much of a dent in performance I could inflict in FedEx by extracting a manufactured dividend at the worst possible time. To this end, I started the analysis period in 2000, just before the 2001 recession, and only a few years before the 2007 financial crisis. I wanted to understand what would happen to the theory of manufactured dividends when a recession hits the year after we retire?(Full disclosure: I am long UPS)A higher yield is sometimes an indication of an underpriced stock, but this isn’t the case for UPS. The UPS yield is higher because they distribute a higher percentage of their profits to shareholders. Over the last five years, UPS has distributed about 75% of their earnings in the form of dividends, while FedEx has kept their payout ratio to about 15%. The difference is a matter of policy. FedEx, chooses to reinvest a greater proportion of their earning in the company, while UPS prefers to distribute more cash.Compared to FedEx, UPS is expensive. Except for spikes during the financial crisis and in 2013, which were driven by temporary drops in EBITDA (lower panel), UPS shares have consistently traded at a higher EV/EBITDA multiple (upper panel). Currently, despite the recent run up in the FedEx share price, UPS is trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of about 14.9 compared with 9.5 for FedEx.Both companies have operated with low leverage, but since the financial crisis, UPS has pushed up its debt to EBITDA ratio. It currently stands at a still low 2.16, compared with an even lower ratio of 1.81 for FedEx.In both cases the dividend appears rock solid and has been well covered by free cash flow, a measure including both operating expenses and capital expenditures. The recent dips in the UPS and FedEx free cash flows are driven by their pre-announced step up in investments. Neither company has been borrowing to artificially juice up their dividends.Some companies, particularly when faced with periods of high capital expenditures, choose to fund portions of their investment program by issuing shares. Both FedEx and UPS have recently ramped up their capital expenditures, but neither company has followed this strategy. In fact, both companies have reduced their total share count. Over the last five years, FedEx has reduced shares outstanding by 15.4%, compared to 9.7% for UPS.Over a longer timeframe, UPS’s share count dropped by more. Since 2000, UPS reduced total shares outstanding by 21.8%, compared with 7.52% for FedEx.A company’s ability to grow is, in part, driven by the difference between their investment returns and their cost of capital. While the investment returns for both companies has been strong, UPS’s has been stronger. UPS’s Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), 19.35%, has been twice as high as FedEx’s 9.67%.Despite UPS’s higher yield, higher return on investment, and higher share repurchase program, FedEx delivered better total stockholder returns. Over the last ten years, assuming all dividends were reinvested, the total return for FedEx was 158.5%, compared with 117% for UPS.Since 2000, the difference is even more pronounced. FedEx shares generated a whopping total return of 494%, compared with just 174% for UPS—2.84 times higher!One reason for this is that FedEx hasn’t just being stingy with its cash; it has been plowing the money back into the business. Over the last 10 years, FedEx capital expenditures have been almost twice as high as UPS—even though the market cap for UPS is 62% larger.These investments have paid off, and FedEx has closed the revenue gap with its larger rival (lower panel). In fact, one of the reasons UPS’s market cap remains higher, is because its shares trade at a higher EV/EBITDA multiple. UPS shares sell at a premium.To be fair, over the last ten years, there were several periods when the total return for UPS was higher than FedEx. Also, FedEx shares have been more volatile. During the 2008/09 recession, FedEx share prices fell by 70% from their pre-recession peak, and traded at an EV/EBITDA multiple of just 3.88! UPS shares fell by “only” 46% in the same period. The total return, as measured from February 2007, when FedEx prices peaked, to the lowest point in the Great Recession, was a loss of 69.7% for FedEx, compared with a loss of 43.2% for UPS.A large portion of the change in value was not driven by financial results, but by valuation multiples. As measured from February 2007, FedEx’s EV/EBITDA multiple contracted by about 55%, compared to a drop of just 28% for UPS. The opposite effect occurred during the recovery. Since July 1, 2009, FedEx’s EV/EBITDA multiple expanded by about 60%, compared to about 40% for UPS. FedEx’s valuation multiple expands more quickly during recoveries and contracts faster during recessions.The analysis, so far, assumes all dividends are reinvested. But what if we extract the UPS dividend yield from FedEx? To do this, I calculated the actual cash payment we would need to extract from FedEx to match the UPS yield at the time their dividend was paid.As we have seen, FedEx’s stock price has been more volatile and, during the two recessions in the analysis period, FedEx’s share price fell more sharply than UPS. Recall that 2001 was a recession year, which means that to get our manufactured dividend, we had to sell FedEx shares during a recession in the very beginning of the analysis period. This scenario is exactly the reason I naturally favor dividend stocks. I don’t want to have to worry about selling shares “when there is blood on the streets,” so as to speak.In this case, since 2000 the dividend adjusted return for FedEx drops to about 286%, compared with about 109% for UPS. In other words, despite the inauspicious start date, only a few months before the 2001 recession, and the 2008/09 financial crisis that soon followed, the FedEx return with manufactured dividends was 2.62 times higher than UPS!With dividends reinvested, FedEx’s return was 2.84 times higher, and with manufactured dividends it was 2.62 times better. The closeness of the numbers, in my view, is not a coincidence. FedEx’s performance was better because of the extraordinary level of its investment (capital expenditures), compared with its market value. This investment generated decent, if not stellar returns, but this was enough to push cash flow up at a much faster clip.The manufactured dividend was much less than the growth rate in EBITDA/share—and so, despite periodic share sales, the remaining investment gained in value. The gain was roughly proportional to the growth in EBITDA/share. If our manufactured dividend had been too high, our remaining share of the EBITDA would have declined, and the value of the remaining investment would likely have been lower.This does not mean dividends are bad. If a company does not have a sufficient number of high return projects available, distributing the cash in the form of dividends or share buy backs is certainly better than making bad investments. But I think this analysis suggests we should not reject a company because the yield is too low, provided we believe they are investing their cash wisely.This suggests three conclusions:To be sure, both companies have performed well. UPS’s ten and seventeen-year total returns closely match the S&P 500 index, while FedEx has outperformed. Of course, past performance is not necessarily predictive for future results. It is entirely possible UPS will outperform FedEx over the next ten years. The competitive environment for both companies has changed in many respects, and FedEx is a much larger company, making it more difficult for it to grow.I’m also aware that a single case study does not prove a theory. Still, I think this analysis suggests a manufactured dividend can be at least as good as the real thing, and that a dividend paying stock is not necessarily worth a premium valuation."
4110814,103321,2017-09-30T07:21:21-04:00,"FedEx released its Q1 fiscal 2018 earnings with positive revenue growth, though the cyberattack in June has resulted in a loss of $300 million in operating income.The firm is well positioned to capture the demand of e-commerce with its fulfillment services and GENCO acquisition.FedEx’s profit improvement program is expected to grow its profit by $1.2-1.5 billion through fiscal 2020.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) released its Q1 fiscal 2018 earnings report in mid-September with its TNT Express subsidiary dragged down its EPS due to a cyberattack in late June. As a result, management lowered its fiscal 2018 guidance. However, its shares continued to trend higher. Since the beginning of the year, FedEx shares have outperformed the S&P 500 with an impressive 20% gain, whereas the S&P 500 index only gained about 11.2%. Even recently, the shares continued to climb higher reaching an all-time high on Sept. 28. Will the rally continue?Upon examining FedEx’s business model, its recent earnings release, its future prospect, we believe there is room for its shares to move even higher next year.Source: YCharts.ComLet us first take a look at the company's Q1 fiscal 2018. FedEx has three major segments: FedEx Express, which also includes its TNT Express subsidiary that the firm acquired last year; FedEx Ground; and FedEx Freight. FedEx Express consists of 57% of Q1 revenue, Ground consists of 30% of revenue, and Freight 11%.In the past quarter, FedEx Express' US domestic package revenue increased to $3.08 billion or 3% year over year. Its international export package revenue also increased to $2.51 billion, or a growth of 4% year over year. This growth is excellent given that the TNT Express subsidiary was negatively impacted by the cyberattack and TNT’s revenue has not yet fully recovered. FedEx Ground’s revenue saw upper-single-digit growth. Its revenue grew to $4.64 billion or a growth rate of 8%. FedEx Freight’s revenue expanded to $1.75 billion, or a growth rate of 6%. The growth rate is excellent.FedEx Revenue by Segment (Source: Created by Author, Company Reports)FedEx’s total revenue for the quarter was $15.3 billion, or a growth of 4% year over year. Adjusted operating earnings declined by 7% to $1.24 billion due to costs incurred related to the cyberattack in June and to Hurricane Harvey. Management estimated that the attack had resulted in a loss of approximately $300 million in operating income or $0.79 per diluted share. On the other hand, Hurricane Harvey only impacted the firm by $0.02 per share. Overall, FedEx’s Q1 fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS was $2.51, down by $0.31 from Q1 last year. Management has also lowered its guidance for fiscal year 2018. Now it expects an EPS of $12.75, down from its previous guidance of $13.78.Although FedEx’s Q1 EPS missed the consensus estimate by $0.58 per share, its EPS would have been a beat if there had been no losses due to the cyberattack. Moving forward, the company will have to take necessary actions to improve its network security to reduce the risk of this from happening again.Now that we have discussed about FedEx’s Q1 fiscal 2018 earnings release, we will look at its growth initiatives and see how this will help drive revenue and earnings growth.Profit Improvement ProgramIn an aim to improve its profits, FedEx announced in fiscal 2017 that it will continue its profit improvement program that was introduced in October 2012. The plan aims at cost reductions, efficiency improvements, service repositioning, and replacement of less efficient fleets. The profit improvement plan has resulted in $1.7 billion in profit enhancement and is expected to improve its profit by an additional $1.2-1.5 billion through fiscal 2020.GENCO AcquisitionIn 2016, FedEx acquired GENCO, a leading reverse logistics firm. This acquisition opens a new market for FedEx, the resale of returned goods. The benefit is easy to see, FedEx will be able to utilize its transportation service and that GENCO’s return service will be an added value to FedEx’s supply chain. With returns representing 20-30% of all the goods transported through e-commerce and with FedEx supply chain, the firm will have an end-to-end solution for returns. With this, FedEx can use its leverage with retailers to get its outbound shipping and the returns. This move is logical as e-commerce typically has much higher returns. The ability to provide such an end-to-end service gives FedEx a competitive advantage.FedEx Fulfillment ServicesFedEx has a fulfillment service to serve small and medium retailers. The services offer its retail customers an opportunity to focus on their core business while letting FedEx manage warehouse and fulfillment inventory, transportation, management, returns, etc. In early September, the company just opened its second California fulfillment facility. Together with its other fulfillment centers, FedEx can reach 94% of the population in the United States in two days via FedEx Ground. The move should help increase its revenue, and to secure the delivery businesses as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has gradually introduced its own delivery services and become less reliant on shipping partners like FedEx.In the past few years, FedEx’s capital expenditure was on the rise. In its current fiscal year, the company expects to spend $5.9 billion in capex to expand its network, and to replace its aging planes with new fleets in its FedEx Express segment. The current year capex was up by $0.8 billion from its fiscal 2017. Capex in 2013 was $3.4 billion. The trend is a bit worrisome, as in its fiscal 2017, the company generated negative free cash flow of $186 million due to high capital expenditures. With even a higher capex, it is expected that this negative trend will continue in 2018.Moving beyond 2018, we believe FedEx’s operating cash flow will steadily increase as the company completes its integration with TNT Express, which the firm believes will result in $1.5 billion in synergies. The retirement of older and less efficient fleets will also result in significant savings in its operating expense. Its expansion of networks will impact the revenue positively as well. We see the current high capex as the necessary growing pain.FedEx currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. This is equivalent to only 0.88% dividend yield. However, FedEx’s dividend growth rate has been excellent in the past few years, offering double-digit growth. Its payout ratio in terms of EPS is only in the 20% range. Although high capex in fiscal 2018 will result in low free cash flow and may limit dividend growth this year, its dividend has the potential to grow significantly in the next few years.The firm currently has $14.91 billion in long-term debt. Its long-term debt to capitalization ratio is 48.1%. The interest coverage ratio and financial leverage in its fiscal 2017 were 9.9x and 3.02 respectively. Its financial leverage is a little bit higher (it was in the range of 1.7-2.2x between 2008 and 2014), but the company’s interest coverage ratio is healthy.FedEx has a 10-year average PE ratio of about 20.0x. The consensus among 21 analysts for its fiscal year 2018 EPS is $12.48 per share. This is lower than FedEx’s guidance of $12.75. Using the consensus EPS and the PE ratio of 20x, we derived our target price of $249.6. With dividend, we have a total return of about 11.3%.While FedEx may have lowered its fiscal 2018 guidance to $12.75, we think the firm is well positioned to grow its revenue and earnings as the demand of e-commerce continues to rise. Its profit improvement program and the integration of TNT Express will result in significant cost savings. With a target total return of 11.3%, FedEx’s shares remain attractive. We think there is still more room for its share price to grow in the upcoming year.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4133114,22148,2017-12-20T19:00:48-05:00,FedEx reported FQ2 results that blew past analyst estimates.The package delivery company will benefit from U.S. tax cuts.The company is relying too much on shipping rate hikes when the growth in the sector is based on cutting shipping costs via efficiencies.,"Similar to the market, FedEx (FDX) has remained in a solid uptrend for the last couple of years. In the process, the company has shaken off the fears over Amazon (AMZN) taking over online retail delivery, but my ongoing research continues to warn of valuation concerns. The stock is trading at multi-year highs near $250 as the tax cuts look to boost profits. FedEx was a bargain in the $150s last year, but do investors really want to chase FedEx higher? The headline FQ2 numbers were strong with the package delivery company beating estimates by a wide margin with an adjusted EPS of $3.18. The $0.29 beat appears impressive until FedEx mentions an equal benefit from foreign tax credits. Without that benefit, the company would have only delivered an EPS of $2.89, inline with expectations in comparison to $2.77 last year. The real story is the bigger picture. FedEx now forecasts earnings of roughly $13 per share, and assuming the recovery from the cyber attack affecting TNT Express, the numbers could've been higher. In addition, the company forecasts a $1 benefit from the tax cuts placing the EPS run rate closer to $14. Throw in some growth next year where the market was already assuming a $2.50 boost to earnings and one might envision FedEx earning over $16 per share next year, up from the current $15 projections. The story has turned more bullish than my expectations even though the Amazon threat wasn't ever realistic and hasn't shifted business away from the package delivery firms. Regardless, Amazon always remains a risk. The strong global economy is boosting revenues as FedEx Express and Ground grew revenues due too the ability to raise rates and grow shipments. The fears that higher rates including the January 1 price hikes of 4.9% would hurt the business at a time that online retailers are looking to reduce shipping costs just isn't playing out. This doesn't mean that it won't eventually occur. With the mounting issues with ""porch pirates,"" FedEx has smartly invested in a network of pick-up locations. The company suggests that the majority of the U.S. population is within nine minutes of a FedEx locations to allow for convenient package pick ups without the risk of these thieves stealing holiday gifts or valuation electronic items. Source: FedEx FQ2'17 earnings presentation The key investor takeaway is that FedEx remains one of the investment stories similar in this market where the stock was attractive some 100 points ago and not so much now. The tax cuts do help the bull thesis, but the package delivery company just isn't worth the risk up at $250, requiring massive EPS gains next year to even bring the valuation inline.The most troublesome part is that the FQ2 results weren't the blowout numbers suggested by the headlines and higher shipping rates are problematic to the long-term story."
4135599,103321,2018-01-05T12:09:53-05:00,FedEx is a leading multinational courier delivery services company.The company’s top and bottom lines growth rate accelerated in its Q2 fiscal 2018.FedEx is expected to benefit from favorable economic outlook in 2018.Its shares are fairly valued but with upside potential.,"FedEx Corporation (FDX) released its Q2 fiscal 2018 earnings report on December 19, 2017 with strong top and bottom lines growth. The company appears to be regaining growth momentum following a poor Q1 due to cyber attacks and hurricanes. In its Q2 earnings release, FedEx also raised its fiscal 2018 guidance. Despite its shares’ fair valuation, the company should be able to benefit from a favorable economic outlook and cost savings from TNT Express integration. Therefore, I believe there is still room for the shares to trade higher.FDX data by YChartsLet us first take a look at FedEx’s latest quarterly report. As can be seen from the table below, in Q2, FedEx’s revenue grew by 9.4% year-over-year to $16.3 billion. Its adjusted EPS grew by 15% to $3.18 per share. Its operating margin went up by 30 basis points to 8.5% year over year. After a slower Q1 (mainly due to cyber attacks to its TNT Express), it appears that FedEx is now regaining momentum.Source: Q2 2018 Earnings ReleaseGrowth Rate Accelerating FedEx has three major segments: FedEx Express which also includes its TNT Express subsidiary that the firm acquired last year, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. Let us now take a look at FedEx’s growth by segments as shown in the two tables below. The top and bottom tables list FedEx’s revenue and operating income growth in the past two quarters respectively. As can be seen from the two tables, its Q2 year-over-year growth rates in revenue and operating income are much better than the growth rate in Q1. Momentum is clearly picking up again in FedEx’s businesses after a slow Q1.Source: Company ReportsSource: Company Reports Following the earnings release, FedEx also raised its fiscal 2018 guidance. The company now expected EPS of $12.70 ~ $13.30 in its fiscal 2018 (previous guidance was $12.00 ~ $12.80).Its CFO Alan B. Graf, Jr. expressed this optimism in the following statement, “We are increasing our fiscal 2018 forecast, due to enhanced revenue quality, solid demand trends and our success in restoring business impacted by this summer’s cyberattack.”Source: Q2 2018 Earnings ReleaseThere are several important events or trends that I believe readers should be aware of:(1) Tax Reform Will Significantly Increase its EPSFedEx is one of the winners of the U.S. tax reform. In addition to the guidance, management gave us a glimpse of what the new tax reform might impact its EPS. It is expecting that the increase in EPS will be in the range of $4.40 to $5.50 per share. The boost is primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities and lower tax rates.(2) Higher Capital Expenditure in the Near Term ExpectedFedEx's free cash flow has been negative in the past two quarters. In fact, it has a $1.26 billion deficit in free cash flow in the past 12 months. The reason is its higher capital expenditure mainly driven by high expenses related to its TNT Express integration. For its fiscal 2018, FedEx is expected to spend about $5.9 billion in capital expenditures as the company accelerates the integration process and increases the investment to merge TNT Express’ IT infrastructure to FedEx’s infrastructure. I treat this as a necessary investment as this will result in significant synergies (more will be discussed below). While the higher capital expenditure has resulted in negative free cash flow in the past few quarters, its free cash flow should gradually improve.(3) Improvement in Operating Margin ExpectedFedEx has a long-term goal of bringing its operational margin above 10%. Its past quarter operating margin was 8.7%. In order to achieve its goal, the obvious place to improve its operating margin is to improve its lower margin TNT Express (operating margin in the low single-digit). As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the company is in the midst of integrating its TNT Express with FedEx’s Express segment. The company expects about $1.2 to $1.5 billion in synergies by fiscal 2020. This will help improve its operating margin. As its CFO stated, “We expect to see improved results in our fiscal second half, and we reaffirm our commitment to improve operating income at the FedEx Express segment by $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.”Since FedEx’s businesses greatly depends on the health of U.S. and global economies, FedEx regularly provides their GDP growth forecast on U.S. and global economies. In its December report, management revised their forecast of U.S. and global GDP growth by 10 basis points in 2018. They now expect U.S. and global economies to grow by 2.5% and 3.0% respectively. Given that FedEx has already built a strong global network, I believe FedEx is in a good position to capture this favorable trend.Source: Company PresentationShares of FedEx have risen over 40% in the past one year. Its trailing PE ratio of 24.0x is slightly above S&P500’s 22.9x. While its shares have reached historical high, its trailing PE ratio is still below its 5-year average of 26.9x. Comparing to its rival United Parcel Services's (UPS) trailing PE ratio of 31.0x, FedEx is also trading at a discount. Its current price to cash flow ratio of 18.6x is also below UPS’s 20.1x. With $1.5 billion synergies expected from TNT Express integration by fiscal 2020, FedEx’s cash flow will improve greatly. This will make its future price to cash flow ratio even more attractive. Both PE and price to cash flow ratio show that FedEx is not expensive.Source: Created by author, Morningstar.comFedEx appears to be gaining momentum in its top and bottom line growth in its Q2 fiscal 2018. While its current share valuation is fair, there is still more upside potential as FedEx should be able to benefit from an expanding global economy. Its savings from TNT Express integration should also contribute to its EPS favorably. Therefore, I believe FedEx remains a long-term dividend growth choice. However, over the past week, its shares have risen by about 6%. I would recommend buying it incrementally and averaging it down when there is a pullback.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

The market has chosen to overlook some one-time issues to focus on the future.FedEx is trading up about $4 in mid-day trading to $220. The package delivery company has shaken off the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fears, but is the market wise to make such a move?FedEx reported an EPS of $2.51 for FQ1. The company technically missed estimates up at $3.09 and reported a decline from the $2.82 number from last year.The big issue was a $0.79 hit from the cyberattack that disrupted operations at TNT Express. Investors can, and probably should, consider the number as a one-time hit, though some issues still linger with the business now months later from the June 27 attack. Adding these numbers back and some financial sites probably rightfully view the results as a beat.Investors, though, need to consider the cyberattack impact and recent shipping rate hikes as concerns for the long-term health of the business. FedEx is spending heavily to keep Amazon out of the shipping business, but the decision to further raise rates by nearly 5% on January 1 will eventually harm a business that should, in theory, turn cheaper per package as higher volumes improve the efficiency of delivery.Source: FedEx press releaseThe previous investment thesis continues to struggle with owning FedEx while it is burning cash. The stock isn't expensive, trading at about 16.5x the adjusted EPS estimates for the year, but the company burned another $500 million in cash during the last quarter alone. Capital expenditures alone exceeded depreciation and amortization charges by nearly $300 million.Source: FedEx FQ1'18 earnings release The key investor takeaway is that people shouldn't assume that an e-commerce boom will benefit the stock. FedEx is spending like crazy to upgrade facilities and operations, while raising shipping rates that could halt package delivery growth or, at the very least, encourage the development of alternative options.The negative thesis is maintained, as heavy spending and higher rates isn't a combination for success."
4107802,55342,2017-09-18T21:26:39-04:00,"Courier delivery service company FedEx is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on September 19, after the market close.The costs, TNT Express subsidiary performance and the financial impact of June cyber attack will be the main focus in the earnings release.Will FedEx deliver another strong earnings as in Q4-2017?","FedEx Corporation (FDX) is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Tuesday, September 19, after the market close. The company had ended fiscal 2017 on a strong note with highest ever volumes and service levels. FDX stock had been on the rise after the strong Q4-2017 earnings, but has struggled since the company's announcement that it could see a material financial impact from June's cyber attack. The stock closed the last trading session at $214.83 a piece, slightly over 2% higher since its last earnings announcement. The big question now is: Will the upcoming earnings announcement help FedEx stock shake off the negative sentiment? Will an earnings beat lift FDX stock?The Wall Street consensus expects FedEx to report earnings of $3.14 a share on revenue of $15.38 billion. The Wall Street consensus implies revenue growth of 4.9% on a year-on-year basis and EPS growth of 8.27% over the year-ago EPS print of $2.9 a share. The expected earnings growth pales in front of the massive double-digit YoY growth in EPS the company had reported in the last quarter. The top line growth estimate is again much lower than the YoY revenue growth achieved by the company in the last few quarters.Coming to guidance, in the Q4 earnings call, the management gave an earnings guidance of $13.20 to $14 per share for FY 18. These numbers do not take into account year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments and exclude TNT integration and restructuring expenses. The company's capital spending forecast for FY '18 was stated to be approximately $5.9 billion. The costs, TNT Express subsidiary performance and the financial impact of June cyber attack will be the main focus in the earnings release. Many analysts are skeptical about the company's performance in Q1 on account of the impact of the cyber attack in June, which crippled the company's European operations.FedEx has a mixed record of trumping Wall Street estimates. According to the Estimize database, the company has beaten Wall Street estimates in 5 out of the last 8 reported quarters. The special mention is the last quarter earnings in which it delivered a massive earnings surprise of 35 cents. However, looking at the most recent four-quarter time frame, FDX has missed Wall Street earnings estimates in two of the last four reported quarters. The fears of an earnings miss are not unwarranted going by the recent history.Source: EstimizeComing to the revenue numbers, FDX went on to beat the analyst revenue estimates in all of the last 8 quarters. When compared to the high end of Wall Street's revenue expectations, the company beat the top end of the range in 3 out of the last 8 quarters.Source: EstimizeFDX stock has a history of making big movements in response to earnings announcements. Following the last four earnings releases, the stock has gained 1.82%, on average, in the trading session immediately following an earnings release.Given the encouraging post-earnings movement of FedEx stock, a beat in Q1 could lift the FDX stock out of the sluggishness witnessed after cyber attack announcement. The big question now is, Will FedEx deliver an earnings beat tomorrow?There are mixed expectations from the company's Q1 earnings even after a strong last quarter performance. This is mainly on account of the current headwinds, especially the impact of the June cyber attack which could play spoilsport. The FDX Q1 2018 earnings whisper number is optimistic and stands at $3.20, implying a 6 cent beat or a 1.91% earnings surprise. TThe cyber attack impact has weighed heavy on the stock of late. In this context, an earnings surprise for FedEx comes under doubt, investors will also be likely to be focused on rising costs. Also, investors should keep an eye out for growth in the FedEx Express segment, which achieved double-digit adjusted operating margins for the full year for the first time. The company is targeting operating income improvement at the new FedEx Express segment of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in FY '20."
4095933,33291,2017-08-07T13:29:01-04:00,Credit Suisse is out with a bullish call on FedEx.We discuss the so-called secular tailwinds.Covering reasons to be bullish with an eye on narrowing operating income.Short-term pressure.,"Credit Suisse is out with a call on FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) today. Specifically, the firm is reiterating its bullish view on the stock, which seemingly is stemming from an investor meeting with management. Analysts explicitly note that there are growing secular tailwinds that will push domestic pricing higher in the near- and long-term. Of course you may recall when we at Quad7Capital covered the cyber attack fallout. Credit Suisse acknowledged that in the short-run there would be overhang, but agreed with our thesis that this is in the short-term only. We applaud the bullish stance and agree with the call, as we believe the name is a buy under $200. While we believe the stock would possibly test $220, Credit Suisse is even more bullish with an outperform rating on the name and a $237 price target, a full 17 points ahead of ours.Is it too bullish? Perhaps in the short-run. Recall that when shares pulled back heavily a year ago in June 2016 we noted this as a buying opportunity, and that has paid off. It is important to understand that when we first opined on the name, we thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. While it is priced for strong performance given its expanding multiple, the stock moves higher and higher. We also think that Credit Suisse should have acknowledged the dividend. When we initiated coverage we believed it should have raised its dividend, and of course it did recently raise the payout 60%. Are more hikes possible? We fully believe so. That said, FedEx has had questionable quarters, but that is no reason to expect growth to suddenly stop. However, in the most recent quarter, the name showed why we should be bullish, independent of the cyber attack on TNT operations.Why? Well its earnings not only met expectations but exceeded them handily in the most recent quarter. Revenue was a solid $15.7 billion, rising 21.0% year-over-year and beating estimates by $140 million. As reported earnings were $3.75 for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to a loss of $0.26 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Considering adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income actually spiked significantly year-over-year to $1.76 billion from $1.51 billion. Adjusted earnings were $4.25 per share, up decidedly from $3.30 last year. What is more, these earnings crushed estimates by $0.37.We were not surprised by the beats, although the degree to which consensus was surpassed was unexpected. Given that the company has also been watching expenses and has put into place profit improvement program initiatives, solid performance was expected. Mind you, oil prices are a huge expense, and the net impact of fuel has been lower in recent years, helping to improve results. One of the few blemishes worth noting was that operating margin was pressured and came in at 11.2%, down from 11.7% last year on an adjusted basis. Much of this is from higher expenses associated with TNT.Where the strength lies is within each segment. They are performing beautifully, lending support to Credit Suisse's 'tailwinds' remark. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.70 billion, up 6% from last year's $1.61 billion. However, due to lower average weight per packages, flat volume and higher wage expenses, operating income was pressured again. It fell 3% to $133 million, down from the $137 million a year ago. In the Ground segment, revenues increased strikingly, coming in at $4.68 billion, up 9% from last year's $4.29 billion. Operating income rose 7% to $702 million, from $656 million a year ago. Further, TNT Express saw revenues of $1.91 billion. Operating expense was high and as such adjusted operating income was $83 million, with margins of 4.4%. Then there is the all-important Express segment. Revenues were $7.18 billion, up from $6.72 billion last year. This 7% rise was a result of higher package volume, international expansion and higher base rates. Expenses here were well managed and operating income rose 20% to $909 million on an adjusted basis.In, summation we concur with the Credit Suisse upgrade, although the price target is more inflated then ours. The key is that we are bullish as well as the growth in e-commerce has driven FedEx's growth as well as that of other rivals. Revenues were up sharply as a whole, and are expected to continue to rise, even with the TNT issues. We expect a few quarters of continued pressure on the back of competition and the cyber attack, but with moderate economic growth expected and adjusted earnings expected to be somewhere in the $12.00 per share range, we remain long-term bullish.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4088110,33291,2017-07-17T11:02:04-04:00,FedEx is out with an update on the TNT cyberattack.A discussion of revenues and potential impacts.Adjusting my estimates.,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) shares are on watch today as we just learned of an update regarding the cyber attack of the TNT express segment last month. Seems there will be a significant financial hit here. Let me remind you that back in June, TNT was significantly affected due to the infiltration of an information system virus. TNT Express operations and communications systems were disrupted for an extended period of time but no known data breach with customer data was known to have occurred. However, the name is still reeling from the attack as there are invoicing delays and other shipping hold ups. Shares were halted when it occurred. What is important to note is that the operations of all other FedEx companies were unaffected. However today the company said it will see a “material” impact. Translation: prepare for a revenue and earnings miss this quarter.In today’s update, we learned that all TNT depots, hubs and facilities are operational and most TNT services are available, but the delays persist. Further, manual processes are being used to facilitate a significant portion of TNT operations and customer service functions, effectively taking the company back 20 years technologically. Here is the real kicker: the company “cannot estimate when TNT services will be fully restored”. This means we can expect a severe impact to expected revenues. The company acknowledged this, stating:What is interesting is that despite the impact to revenues which it knows will be sizable, it reaffirmed that it will improve operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017, assuming moderate economic growth. However, this year is likely going to take a big hit. Looking back to last quarter, the TNT Express segment reported strong revenues. Excluding any integration expenses and restructuring charges, TNT Express saw revenues of $1.91 billion. Operating expense was high, and weighed on margins. As reported the GAAP operating income was just $26 million, with margins of 1.4%. Factoring in some adjustments, operating income was $83 million, with margins of 4.4%. While these revenues pale in comparison to the big money maker that is the FedEx Express segment, which saw $7.18 billion in revenues last quarter, a hit to TNT is a hit to overall expected performance.With some back of the napkin estimates, I would say a worst case scenario is a 30% hit to revenues, and at $2 billion in sales, this equates to roughly a max $650 million hit in the quarter for sales. To be clear, I expect it to be less, but it stands to reason that with TNT moving to “manual processes,” that segment expenses will be greater than anticipated. Thus, I expect a hit to the bottom line, perhaps on the order of $0.20 per share. I arrive at this number using Q1 numbers, assuming worst case scenario of a $650 million hit to revenues, which were $15.7 billion last year and estimating a 5%-15% bump in expenses in the TNT segment. Again, just a guesstimate. Whether the company is able to somehow absorb the expenses by cutting elsewhere remains to be seen.Obviously this is awful news. With shares at a 52 week high coming into today, expect some big profit taking. Independent of this attack, I was already expecting a few quarters of continued pressure on margins as TNT was integrated. While it is true that the company expects to incur significant expenses over the next few years in connection with the integration of TNT Express and the Outlook restructuring program, the future is bright, once we escape the plight of this attack. Looking ahead to all of 2017, FedEx has not adjusted guidance. While before this attack I was expecting adjusted earnings to be somewhere in the $11.80 to $12.20 per share range, I now am reducing my estimates to $11.65-$12.05.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4095650,102428,2017-08-06T13:37:36-04:00,"I compared three shipping companies: FDX, UPS, and EXPD.FedEx pulled out the win with UPS and EXPD tied behind it.I dug a little deeper into FDX and its dividend growth potential.","My go to place for initial research into a stock is the Dividend Champion spreadsheet maintained by David Fish. It is incredibly helpful for beginner and seasoned investors alike. I find much of the data very useful when comparing companies. I wanted to use information from this database to compare United Parcel Service (UPS), Expeditors International (EXPD), and FedEx (FDX). These three companies are all part of the integrated shipping and logistics industry.Each of these stocks has its strengths and weaknesses, but by assigning points across a variety of categories, I aim to arrive at a winner of sorts. For each metric, the best company will get 3 points, followed by 2 for second, and a single point for the worst number. Any metrics within 2% of each other will be treated as a tie. Each category will be equally weighted, but could be manipulated based on your goals. For example, if dividend history is of utmost importance, each score in that category could be multiplied by 1.5 to award 4.5 points for first, 3 for second, and 1.5 for third. By the same token, if you find the Graham number less critical, each value could by multiplied by 0.7 to reduce its effect on the final total.The first round of scores will be related to the dividend. EXPD has the longest streak of paying an increasing dividend at 23 years. FDX comes in second with a 16-year streak of increasing dividends. Lastly, UPS has paid a higher dividend over 8 consecutive years.The estimated 5-year payback is a metric that combines the current yield with the projected dividend growth rate for a total income return on a single share of stock. UPS takes the 3 points with a payback of 16.8%. EXPD slips to second with an 8.0% payback. FDX finds itself in last with a 5-year return of only 4.2%.The last dividend based score will be the 5-year DGR divided by the 10-year DGR to arrive at a ratio that indicates whether the dividend growth has been accelerating or decelerating. FDX has the highest 5/10 year DGR at 1.47, meaning the dividend grew 47% faster over the last 5 years than its 10-year average. UPS also has seen acceleration with its ratio at 1.13. EXPD’s DGR has decelerated a bit for a ratio of 0.72. This round ends with a 3 way tie with each company having a first, second, and third place showing.The fundamental data will be the focus of the next round. The Graham number is a method of valuation that assigns a fair value to a stock. The ranks will be based on how close the share price is to its Graham value based on percentages. FDX is the best value by Graham at 69.3% away from fair valuation. Over double that is EXPD which is 146.7% over its Graham number. UPS is way back with a share price 855% higher than fair value according to Graham.Debt levels can be a leading indicator that trouble is lurking at a company. To quantify debt, I will use the debt to equity ratio. UPS and EXPD have essentially no debt at all with a D/E of 0.00. FDX gets stuck in last with a D/E of 0.93, which I don’t think is really all that bad.The next metric will be the estimated 5-year growth of the company because while it is only an estimate, it can serve as a guide. FDX is anticipated to grow the fastest with a projected rate of 12.1%. UPS sits in second with an anticipated 8.3% growth rate. EXPD brings up the rear with an estimated growth of 6.1%.There may be too much made of the price to earnings ratio, but I find it undeniably useful when comparing similar companies. FDX represents the best value with a TTM P/E of 18.76. EXPD sits in second with a ratio of 25.16. UPS falls into last place with a P/E of 27.17.The final metric in the fundamental round will be the PEG ratio which is a combination of the last two values with the P/E divided by the estimated growth rate. FDX once again looks like the best value with a PEG of 1.55. Next is UPS and its 3.27 PEG. With a PEG of 4.15, EXPD comes in last. FDX pulls ahead winning 4 out of 5 metrics leaving UPS and EXPD tied again.The last round will include some miscellaneous data that I always check in my own research. The stability of a stock is measured by its beta with the S&P 500 set at a beta of 1.00. EXPD is the least volatile of the three with a 0.64 beta. In second, but still more stable than the overall market, is UPS with a beta of 0.86. FDX has a beta of 1.27 indicating it’s more volatile than the S&P.One value based metric I consider is the 52-week range. In order to score this, the company trading closest to its 52-week low will get the 3 points. UPS is only 8.0% off of its yearly low. EXPD is in second with a share price 24.7% higher than its 52-week low. FDX has rallied the most over this time frame and is trading 31.5% above the low.The final metric I’ll use is the Chowder number coined by Seeking Alpha contributor Chowder that combines the current yield and the 5-year dividend growth rate. Therefore, the higher the number is, the better opportunity it represents. The best Chowder number belongs to FDX at 21.5. UPS and EXPD are essentially tied with numbers of 11.5 and 11.3, respectively. UPS and EXPD again tie for the round, but this time it’s for first. FDX slides to last.As the table shows, FDX came out as the overall winner. Its fundamental data was especially impressive as its only last place in that round came from its D/E, which is still under 1.00. UPS and EXPD tied in every single round, and therefore, overall as well. EXPD had the upper hand in valuation metrics, while UPS performed better in growth metrics, both earnings and dividends. Since FDX was the victor, I wanted to take a closer look at its dividend growth potential over the next several years.FDX is a Dividend Contender that reached its 16th consecutive year of increasing dividends with a raise last month. It currently has an EPS payout ratio of only 18.0%, which leaves plenty of room for future raises. Another metric that will influence dividend increases is the earnings growth. Over the past 5 years, earnings grew at 11.6% while the dividend grew at 20.6%. That discrepancy isn’t destined to stop immediately with the low payout ratio, but the gap will likely begin to drift smaller. Earnings are anticipated to grow at 12.1% over the coming 5 years, so I believe a forward 5-year DGR of 15% is reasonable. Based on that rate, dividend payments will total $14.34 through August 2022 for a 5-year payback of 6.8%. While the starting yield is low, the dividend growth and valuation make FDX a company for further investigation for inclusion in my own portfolio.

4084024,102306,2017-06-26T16:31:20-04:00,Margins have been declining for two years.FedEx continues to spend a lot on capex.This is a macroeconomic play.,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had a much better quarter on most metrics. Senior Equity Analyst Ben Nye found himself slightly disappointed with the ground segment's margins and the updated guidance moving forward.FedEx ground delivery's operating margins have been in a consistent downtrend for the past two years, starting around 18 percent and reaching as low as 14 percent. This is especially bad news given that this segment has the highest margin and brings about the most revenue. Given its incremental margins, most increases in revenue end up dropping to the bottom line. UPS (NYSE:UPS) has declared an increase in prices coming later in the year, so it will be interesting to see if FedEx follows suit.FedEx is better viewed through a macro lens. It will perform best as business-to-business economies improve. If GDP were to drop below 2 percent growth, FedEx will begin to feel some serious pressure. It has a relatively low valuation compared other industrials, albeit it's not a company you should compare with the others in its space directly. The first thing that jumps off of the page in a negative manner is the free cash flow. It continues to spend a lot on capex and leaves less room to return money to shareholders.Watch the video for more in-depth analysis."

It is important to understand that when I first opined on the name, I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive.

I have felt bullish on the name all year while others are saying that it should be sold and avoided. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) simply crushing retailers, shippers stand to gain because Amazon needs to move its packages. That said, FedEx has had questionable quarters, but that is no reason to expect growth to suddenly stop. However, in the most recent quarter, I suspect the next leg up for the stock is underway.Why? Well the company has just reported another quarter of earnings and expectations were pretty high. Yet, these expectations were met and exceeded handily. Well, revenue was $15.7 billion, rising 21.0% year-over-year and beating estimates by $140 million. That is a strong positive I thought. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $3.75 for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to a loss of $0.26 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income actually spiked significantly year-over-year to $1.76 billion from $1.51 billion. Adjusted earnings were $4.25 per share, up markedly from $3.30 last year. The earnings crushed estimates by $0.37. A rally is warranted on these headlines.Interestingly, this increase came even though the per share earnings should be on the rise due to a large increase in buybacks. I was not surprised by the beats given that the company has also been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense, and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year, helping to improve results. That said, operating margin was pressured and came in at 11.2%, down from 11.7% last year on an adjusted basis. Make no mistake the TNT acquisition and incorporation is pricey. It will take time.Segment-specific results were impressive for the most part. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.70 billion, up 6% from last year's $1.61 billion. However, due to lower average weight per packages, flat volume and higher wage expenses, operating income was pressured again. It fell 3% to $133 million, down from the $137 million a year ago. Of course, operating margin was also pressured, coming in at 7.8%, down from the from the 8.5% last year. These results weighed on overall performance.Turning to the Ground segment, revenues increased noticeably, coming in at $4.68 billion, up 9% from last year's $4.29 billion. Thanks to higher yields and volume operating income benefited even though it was offset by labor costs and network expansion expenses. Operating income rose 7% to $702 million, from $656 million a year ago. Margins here surprised me as they dropped year-over-year, despite the rise in operating income. Operating margin was 15%, down from 15.3% the previous year.The TNT Express segment reported strong revenues. Of course there are no year-over-year comparisons available yet. Excluding any integration expenses and restructuring charges, TNT Express saw revenues of $1.91 billion. Operating expense was high, and weighted on margins. As reported the GAAP operating income was just $26 million, with margins of 1.4%. Factoring in some adjustments, operating income was $83million, with margins of 4.4%.Of course the big money maker is the FedEx Express segment. Revenues were $7.18 billion, up from $6.72 billion last year. This 7% rise stems from higher package volume, international expansion and higher base rates. Expenses here were well managed and operating income rose 20% to $909 million on an adjusted basis. Turning to margins, they were a solid 12.7%, rising from 11.3%.While expenses weighed once again quarter on margins, it is clear that volumes are strong and the company has pricing power. The growth in internet commerce has driven FedEx's growth as well as that of other rivals. In terms of deliveries, for the most part I felt the quarter was better than expected based on the results. Revenues were up sharply as a whole. I would like to see more strengths in margins. Competition also remains a bottleneck for the company. I expect a few quarters of continued pressure on this front, but the stock continues to motor higher. While it is true that the company expects to incur significant expenses over the next few years in connection with the integration of TNT Express and the Outlook restructuring program, the future is bright. Looking ahead to all of 2017, FedEx expects moderate economic growth but hinted a precise estimate of sales and earnings is tough. We can expect adjusted earnings to be somewhere in the $11.80 to $12.20 per share range. I see the stock testing the $220 range this summer.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4108774,102581,2017-09-22T08:15:24-04:00,"Excluding the impact of the cyber attack, company performance of FedEx was largely along expected lines.Based on my projections, I have valued the firm at $225.Existing investors may want to hold on to their investments and new investors might want to seek a wider margin of safety.","FedEx (FDX) reported its first quarter earnings on Tuesday with a lot of one-time items souring the company's guidance. A large portion of the loss was related to the malware attack on TNT. Excluding these items, the company stated that it would have maintained its previous guidance. I used the information provided on the earnings call as the basis for projecting company free cash flows over the next three years. Based on the valuation I derived, I think existing investors with a long-term perspective can hold onto their investments. Those looking to create new positions on this ticker may want to seek a wider margin of safety.I say long-term because I feel this is a high-reward, high-risk bet. Apart from the thin excess returns described below in the review, the complicated and long process of TNT integration (expected to be completed by FY20) also create a key source of risk. The impact on the current quarter is a case in point.Revenue in the quarter increased 4.1% to $15.3 billion driven by higher package volumes and increase in revenue per package in both the Express and Ground segments. The domestic Express business was an exception with average volumes down one percent in the quarter. The company also announced a 4.9% increase in pricing in Express, Ground, and Freight to take effect in January. Considering some of the expected pricing improvements, I have assumed a revenue growth rate in the 6%-7% range over the next three years.Through the leverage gained by revenues increasing at a faster pace than costs, I have projected operating margins improving by 100 basis points to 9.5% in FY2020. The company maintained that the tax rate is expected to be around 35% and therefore I have kept it at level. Relative to UPS (NYSE:UPS), FedEx's capex as a percent of sales is higher by more than 200 basis points. Over the long run, I expect this to taper down and in my projections, I have assumed this figure at 7%. This is 150 basis points below the elevated levels of 8.5% last year. Based on these assumptions, FedEx stock was valued at $225.Fedex's excess returns are wafer-thin and create quite a volatile result for minor tweaks in the model. For instance, just a 2% decrease in average revenue growth assumption, ceteris paribus, resulted in a drop in target value from $225 to $170. Reducing the capex to 6% also produced a volatile swing in the company's value. In light of these sensitivities, I would argue that investors track capex and sales figures closely. Sales growth below 6% and capex projection persistently above 8% of sales should serve as a heuristic guideline for further analysis to maintain an investment.Since I have projected financials for the next three years, I used the 36-month beta value (1.10) compiled by Seeking Alpha to calculate the cost of capital. Other non-time series assumptions include a 6% equity risk premium and the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.2% as my risk-free rate. With these assumptions, my weighted average cost of capital was 7.5%.I understand that company valuations can be sensitive to cost of capital assumptions. Therefore, if anyone has a different cost of capital assumption, let me know in the comments. I will let you know the value my model throws up for your WACC. Note that I won't be changing other assumptions for this request.Some of the moving parts in FedEx can be a source of an opportunity as well as a source of risk for FedEx investors. And since a lot of it is expected to clear out only by FY20, I think investors should look at their risk appetite and see if they are comfortable with the kind of volatility present in the valuation of FedEx. I maintain my target at $225 on the ticker.Note: If you find the article interesting, kindly hit the follow button next to my name to be updated about my latest insights!Note: Company-related data sourced from company filing."
4082851,24400,2017-06-21T08:44:44-04:00,"FDX continues to realize stronger profitability from various program initiatives not only at its Express segment, but also strong shipment volume growth at FedEx Ground.FedEx is finding new ways to offset Network expansion costs and the potential threat (if you can call it that) of Amazon.FDX stock could command multiple expansion of 3 to 5 points, which justifies a fair value of $240 to $250 per share some time in 2018.","Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) now have a clear shot to reach $230 in the next 12 to 18 months. I won't pretend that target, which assumes growth of around 10%, is breathtaking. But with the broader market trading at near all-time highs, increasing the chance for a sell-off, FDX stock looks like a smart place to park some profits.Headquartered in Memphis, Tenn., the company continues to realize stronger profitability from various program initiatives not only at its Express segment, but also strong shipment volume growth at FedEx Ground. Combined with better-than-expected e-commerce growth and the positive net impact of fuel, FedEx is finding new ways to offset Network expansion costs and the potential threat (if you can call it that) of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Given these factors, combined with strategic acquisitions such as TNT Express, FDX stock remains one the better bargains on the market. Despite FDX shares already rising some 12% year to date, which has bested the 7% rise in the S&P 500 SPX and the Dow Jones Transportation Average, FDX is priced at just 13 times fiscal 2018 estimates of $15.53 per share, versus a forward P/E of 19 for the S&P 500 index. And here's the thing: $15.53 per share for next year assumes year-over-year growth of 14%.The company is projected to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 13% for the next five years. From my vantage point, investors can get the best of both worlds: A cheap stock and a company that is growing profits above the industry average. Assuming FDX stock traded on par with the rest of the market, these shares would be valued today at around $290. Meanwhile, a conservative multiple of 15 puts FDX stock at around $230, which is more than realistic.Plus, if the shares were to reach their high analyst target of $240, the implied return is about 15% from current levels. And given the fact that FedEx just trounced Wall Street's fourth quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, analysts may be compelled to raise their price targets. After the market closed Tuesday, FedEx posted adjusted earnings of $1.15 billion, or $4.25 per share, compared to $897 million, or $3.30 per share a year ago.The bottom-line beat was by a whopping 37 cents, while quarterly revenues surged 21.2%, which are, in fact, breathtaking for a $55 billion company. It begs the question: Is Wall Street really paying attention to what the company is doing? The company explained:Notably, revenues at FedEx Express rose 7% to $7.18 billion, thanks to a combination of higher base rates and higher package volume. And with operating margin expanding to 12.6% on the back of cost efficiency-related efforts, FDX stock could command multiple expansion of 3 to 5 points, which justifies a fair value of $240 to $250 per share some time in 2018."
4082874,26861,2017-06-21T09:15:06-04:00,"FedEx beat analyst estimates by $0.37 per share; revenues also came in higher by $140 million.Generally, FedEx witnessed robust yield performance, whereas volume growth was moderate to marginal.It is still too early to tell whether FedEx's combined yield and volume performance will similarly play out for upcoming reporting transport peers.Amazon's recently announced acquisition of Whole Foods continues to weigh on markets; combined with FedEx's guidance, trading may remain spotty.","Source: Google ImagesReviewFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) reported their fiscal year-end results yesterday, beating analyst estimates for both adjusted earnings per share and revenues. The bottom-line beat was very strong as FedEx beat estimates by 10 percent with $4.25 per share in adjusted earnings. For the top-line, the beat was much smaller, nearly 1 percent as revenues came in at $15.7 billion.For the fiscal year and largely driven by the TNT Express deal, FedEx's revenues grew by approximately 20 percent to $60.3 billion. For those keeping score, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) trailing twelve-month (NYSE:TTM) revenues as of the March 2017 quarter stood at $61.8 billion, just 2.5 percent higher.Adjusted net income grew at nearly 12 percent for the fiscal year to $3.3 billion, and EBITDA grew by 41 percent to $8.1 billion. The company's operating ratio improved by 230-basis points (bps) to 91.6 percent. With the stock price close at just below $209 per share, FedEx now is trading below 17 times TTM earnings, and again appears to be discounted based upon future expectations.Breaking down the company's operating segments, a reccurring theme was prevalent as volumes were mostly marginal, while yields were robust. The FedEx Express segment witnessed a 7 percent increase in total package revenue, and a 5 percent increase in total freight and other revenue. For the fiscal year, revenues stood at $27.4 billion, or 45 percent of FedEx's total.For the most recent quarter, freight tons were down at -3 percent, while U.S. total packages were up 0.3 percent. Bucking the trend were international total packages which were up 7 percent for the quarter. The U.S. composite package yield was up 7 percent for the quarter, while revenue per freight ton was up 4.5 percent. Contrastingly, the international composite package yield only marginally higher at 0.3 percent.The TNT Express segment did not have a comparable for last year's quarter or fiscal year, but it did display improving trends based upon the previous four consecutive quarters. Package performance was more muted, but freight tons improved strongly from the previous quarter. Yields were moderately higher by 2.4 percent for packages and flat for freight tons as well.For FedEx Ground, package volume increased by 3.3 percent in the most recent quarter, while revenue per package increased by 7 percent. For the company's less-than-truckload (NYSEARCA:LTL) segment, tonnage was flat, while shipments were marginally lower at -0.1 percent. Both revenue per hundredweight and revenue per shipment were up above 5.5 percent from the previous year.Overall, FedEx did witness volume growth, but the driver for beating analyst estimates was impacted by increasing yield performance for the majority of components for each of FedEx's operating segments. The most important part of FedEx's earnings report, is the fact that it is the first major freight company to provide its update. This typically sets the stage for how other peers may end up reporting, as FedEx is one month early.Based on FedEx's results, it appears that yield management will continue to remain highly positive for the LTL industry. What is not certain yet, is whether FedEx's lower pace for volume growth is an indication of the broader industry, or just the result of market dynamics.The other factor may be that other peers will benefit from the later month of June from both a pricing and demand perspective. Many companies which reported in March were still espousing a soft freight environment, but did allude to improving conditions in the April/May months based on their information to that point. Whether this translates to stronger results for industry peers remains to be seen.Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced acquisition of Whole Foods Market (WFM) has sent a strong ripple across multiple industries. For freight, some have speculated that FedEx would begin to lose out as Amazon has shifted towards air cargo lessors, but FedEx still has a strong international advantage for growth (specifically evidenced by the TNT Express deal). The addition of other traditional retailers and newer e-commerce companies looking to compete against Amazon also sets FedEx up domestically to continue to compete for market share.But more interesting to me has been the short-term cloud which has arisen above not just grocery retailers, but retailers in general, foodservice providers and even commodity-based companies for perishables. While I do not discount Amazon's foray into the grocer industry as a threat, I do question the near-term versus long-term impacts of such threat.I have read a lot of speculation regarding how Amazon will possibly take advantage of Whole Foods retail locations. This has mostly related to accessing last-mile deliveries to retail customers for grocery products. But the real question remains: will this utilize more competitive discounted pricing, or will it entail the traditional Whole Foods business model of premium higher-priced products?I do not believe this question can be answered yet. Any grocery delivery service will also need to have a more stringent quality consistency, especially for perishables. The second a delivery is not to the customers standard; they will gladly drive the same distance to get what they prefer. This sets up a company like Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM) to remain a strong competitor, as its perishable products remain as one of the best price/quality propositions in the industry. Other peers including The Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) are in a similar position.If Amazon contests that users can simply go to Whole Foods rather than get a delivery, but the products have shifted from organic and high-quality to discounted priced products, then they will not have the same customers, and they will be reinventing the business model. I do not think that Whole Foods will be used like this in the near-term. Rather, Amazon will likely keep the same business model from a product perspective, add a delivery component (which will lose money) and assess how to reduce prices, or at the minimum, undercut equivalent organic products.Overall, the market has remained in a funk for the industries that have been impacted by Amazon. This is a short-term phenomenon and I expect these companies to return back to their positive trends, especially once earnings get going. Amazon will continue to attempt to pursue newer endeavors to increase its retail market share, but I suspect that Jeff Bezos is more interested in developing a so-called ""gravity model"" where Amazon attracts as many producers and manufacturers as it can.As Wal-Mart Stores' (NYSE:WMT) business model has taught us, scale is the answer to competitive pricing. Being the largest buyer of goods to sell as a retailer is how you begin to strongly influence supplier pricing. Amazon has been extremely successful at scaling in e-commerce, but there still remains a very long way to go, with many uncertainties.SummaryFedEx's fourth quarter results for fiscal year 2017 were very strong, as was the company's entire year performance. Guidance for fiscal year 2018 came in lower than what was expected. The stock was up only 0.9 percent in after-hours. Based on these results, I am not certain that the stock price will have strong positive momentum over the next few days.Amazon continues to push further into e-commerce. The recent deal with Whole Foods is another step in its attempt to further grow into other retail markets. The deal is not bringing a lot to Amazon from a profit or cash flow perspective, and the near-term strategy is not clear. We have anecdotal data that shows Amazon customers are using Wal-Mart and other e-commerce platforms as they begin to find cheaper products.The last point I have to mention is the statement I read regarding Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods being akin to AOL's deal of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). The statement that this is the signal of a ""market top"" is baffling to say the least. Comparing a $165 billion takeover to a $13 billion takeover is just not relatable.In fact, I would contend that we will see further intensifying of consolidation among many industries over the next few years. Maybe the inevitable market top deal will surface at some point over this period. The near-term fears that the market has regarding Amazon are overblown, and FedEx's results are one indicator of this."
4104560,80536,2017-09-06T13:53:46-04:00,This is an interesting time for FedEx because of the huge improvements that internet of things (IoT) can add to its business.FedEx has recently purchased TNT (a European logistics company) and is still in the process of post merger integration but IoT can help speed up the integration of TNT.Yusen Logistics also has an opportunity to extensively deploy IoT solutions to reduce its expensive payroll and cut staff to improve profitability.,"FedEx, a.k.a. Federal Express (NYSE:FDX), is a world-class freight company that operates in 220 countries and is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, in the United States. FedEx prides itself in employing 400,000 employees all across the world. Its primary focus is providing e-commerce solutions, business solutions, and global transportation. FedEx is broken up into several divisions, including FedEx Ground, FedEx Supply Chain solutions, and retail locations, like FedEx office, which grew due to the acquisition of Kinko’s, and much more.FedEx is the worldwide leader in air freight services and is able to manage complex transportation solutions all across the world. To complement its services in Europe, it recently acquired TNT express services, which was a very strong player in the airfreight services industry in Europe, going from London to Istanbul and all across Europe. FedEx currently handles 12 million packages a day, and to manage this large quantity, FedEx owns and operates 650 aircraft and 500,000 motorized vehicles, plus sea-going vessels.During the last decade and a half, FedEx, with global competitors like UPS and regional competitors like Yusen Logistics, has been aggressively pushing to get into China. This is to take advantage of the massive growth within the country and to make available reliable transportation solutions to deliver packages and augment existing supply chains. This will enable FedEx to transport manufactured goods from China to the rest of the world.Yusen Logistics is a Japanese-based freight company that operates in Japan, Asia, the US and Europe. Yusen is staffed by 21,000 people and compared to FedEx is a regional freight company primarily doing business with the rest of the world from Japan and the rest of the Asia. Yusen Logistics (TYO:9370) was formed as a result of the NYK and the original Yusen Company merger in 2010.Like FedEx, the company is driven by the ebbs and flows of the global economy. If the global economy is in a growth and expansion mode, both FedEx and Yusen Logistics will do very well. In summary, FedEx is a global brand that is the US; the term “FedEx it” has entered the lexicon as a verb and means to send a package quickly.The global freight industry consists of several sub-sectors, including logistics services, air and express delivery services, freight rail services, maritime services and trucking services. FedEx, along with global competitors like DHL and UPS (NYSE:UPS), is a key player in all sectors of the freight industry. The global freight industry is easily 10% to 15% of global GDP, so it’s a key sector, and it is fueled by traditional industrialized economies like the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as newly minted emerging markets like Brazil, India, and China.The vast growth in manufacturing and production capacity in China has driven the growth in sea freight and rail transportation in receiving Western countries. For instance, China is a key driver of global logistics because it exports $100 billion worth of goods every month to all parts of the globe. The global freight industry saw some slowdown due to the global recession from 2007 to 2009 but has since picked up. FedEx’s and UPS’s top line revenue growth is a good indicator of how the global freight industry is doing because the company is well diversified across the world.FedEx’s gross profit margin increased from 2014 to 2016 due to the sharp drop in the cost of fuel when global oil prices dropped significantly during this period. Yusen Logistics’ gross profit margin increased from 2014 to 2016 because the cost of sales increased far less than revenues. FedEx’s operating margin decreased from 2014 to 2016 due to increases in purchased transportation. Yusen Logistics’ operating margin remained flat from 2014 to 2016 because selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased proportionally to increases in revenue.Perhaps Yusen’s SG&A expenses are too high at around 15% of sales. Perhaps Yusen Logistics can reduce these expenses by 2% to 3% to increase its bottom line profitability. FedEx’s pretax profit margin dropped from 2014 to 2016 due to increases in the cost of purchased transportation and selling and administrative expenses. Yusen Logistics’ pre-tax profit margin remained flat from 2014 to 2016 due to the same reasons as its operating margins.FedEx’s net profit margin also decreased from 2014 to 2016 due to high operating expenses - purchased transportation and SG&A expenses - and even though it got some relief from low fuel prices, it still was impacted by operating expenses. Yusen Logistics’ net profit margin remained flat from 2014 to 2016, primarily due to high taxation in Japan. FedEx’s tax rate remained flat from 2014 to 2016 and was very much in line with the 35% corporate tax rate in the US.Yusen Logistics’ corporate tax rate reduced from 2014 to 2016 primarily due to the effect of the elimination of intercompany dividends received. FedEx’s return on assets and equity reduced from 2014 to 2016 due to reduced profitability, but the return on assets and equity was still reasonable in 2016. Yusen Logistics’ return on assets and equity remained flat from 2014 to 2016 due to weak profitability during this period.FedEx’s debt ratio increased from 2014 to 2016 due to increases in its long-term liabilities, which resulted from its long-term debt increasing by 91% from 2015 to 2016; this was primarily thanks to the acquisition of TNT by FedEx. This long-term debt increased due to the additional working capital required to run the combined FedEx and TNT operation. This made FedEx’s debt ratio go from a reasonable 53.8% to an unsustainable 70%.Yusen Logistics’ debt ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2016, but at an elevated level of 64%. The FedEx debt ratio was high due to high current liabilities and a non-controlling minority interest. FedEx’s debt-to-equity ratio increased from 2014 to 2016 thanks to increased debt, which was due to the TNT acquisition. Yusen Logistics’ debt-to-equity ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2016 because its liabilities didn’t change significantly during this period.FedEx’s capitalization ratio increased from 2014 to 2016 to approximately 50% thanks to the additional debt that FedEx incurred due to the acquisition of TNT’s global freight and logistics business. Yusen Logistics’ capitalization ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2016 because its capital structure remained unchanged. FedEx’s interest coverage ratio depreciated from 2014 to 2016 due to the increased debt, which came from the acquisition of TNT global logistics.The interest coverage decreased significantly to the high-single digits. This signifies that FedEx needs to work hard to make sure that its employees are working quickly to better realize cost synergies and that the company is utilizing its increased scale to boost its profitability in the very near future. Yusen Logistics’ interest–coverage ratio increased slightly from 2014 to 2016 because it has paid down a small portion of its debt, and its debt position improved slightly.FedEx’s cash flow-to-debt ratio decreased from 2014 to 2016 in response to increased debt on its balance due to the TNT acquisition. Yusen’s cash-flow-to-debt ratio decreased from 2014 to 2016 thanks to its weak profitability, and this weak profitability was due to its high SG&A expenses. FedEx’s financial leverage worsened from 2014 to 2016 because it increased debt on its balance sheet. Yusen Logistics’ financial leverage remained flat from 2014 to 2016, and this shows that it is not aggressively using its debt to boost profitability and increase its level of automation to significantly reduce its SG&A expenses.FedEx’s price-to-book ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2016 because the price the market assigned to the shareholders' equity remained unchanged, which means that the market was not yet assigned a premium to the takeover of TNT by FedEx. This means the market has adopted a wait-and-see approach for now. Yusen Logistics’ price-to-book value remained below 1 from 2014 to 2016 because the market is applying a heavy discount to its assets; this is primarily because of its weak profitability at the time while being under review.FedEx’s price-to-cash-flow dropped from 2014 to 2016 because its stock price increased less than the increase in its operating cash flow. This again points to the market still waiting to see the results of the post-merger integration at FedEx. Yusen Logistics’ price-to-cash flow increased from 2014 to 2016 thanks to reduced cash flow due to weak profitability during this period. FedEx’s price-to-earnings ratio increased from 2014 to 2016 because the market is predicting some increase in the company’s profitability due to the merger.As a result, the stock price increased, though the price-to-earnings ratio is already very high, sitting close to 30. Yusen Logistics’ price-to-earnings ratio decreased from 2014 to 2016 thanks to weak profitability and due to a retreating stock price; this was due to the weak stock price. FedEx’s price-to-sales ratio remained flat from 2014 to 2016, showing that the stock price is reflecting a wait-and-see attitude by investors.Yusen Logistics’ price-to-sales ratio dropped from 2014 to 2016, resulting from a drop in stock price due to investor pessimism. FedEx’s dividend yield remained increased slightly from 2014 to 2016, potentially because management is conserving cash to invest in the newly enlarged entity.FedEx appears poised to expand its sales with the acquisition of TNT and to strategically increase its footprint, mostly in Europe. The near-future outlook for FedEx within a 3-year time frame is a tepid increase in its share price due to the post-merger integration of TNT. Specifically, this is also because the cost synergies promised during the merger will need to be realized during this period so the company can continue to increase its share price.The cost synergies will ensure the increased profitability of FedEx and the combined entity, thus ensuring the share price can reflect the increased value of the combined entity. Yusen Logistics faces a big challenge because the company is not able to operate profitably. The way to solve this challenge is to streamline its cost structure by reducing SG&A expenses. Also, Yusen Logistics will need to reduce its operating expenses, and the way to reduce this is to reduce its employees and embrace automation.Yusen Logistics is operating in an interesting time because it can quickly and at a reasonable expense deploy Internet of Things (IoT) solutions across its logistics network. These IoT solutions will enable Yusen Logistics to get real-time data on how its drivers, trucks, planes, and ships are doing so it can better optimize delivery times and determine when to order repairs and schedule maintenance on its equipment. The bottom line is that Yusen will need to reduce employees and increase automation and IoT solutions in the next 4 years; otherwise, it will be taken over by FedEx or any other integrated global freight company."

        Yet the company has a tremendous dividend growth asset in the way of a low payout ratio.
        This article highlights the firm’s ability to be an ongoing dividend growth star.","Tennessee-based delivery company FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has been putting together a solid dividend growth record for the past decade and a half. Interestingly, this idea often flies under the radar of many income investors.Personally I would chalk this up to three items: the length of history, a dividend ""freeze"" and the comparatively low starting yield. FedEx initiated a dividend back in 2002, which is a fairly long time, but this would still go unnoticed by those looking for 20 year+ streaks.Second, FedEx elected to keep its $0.11 quarterly payment the same from July of 2008 through April of 2010 - representing eight straight quarters of a constant payout. This one is interesting too. On a yearly basis, you still see year-over-year increases. On a fiscal year basis (FedEx ends in May), it looks like the same payment for two years in a row - demonstrating a bit of the finicky nature in keeping track of dividend increase streaks; it can depend on your reference point.By the way, FedEx did elect to keep the payout the same for eight quarters during the recession, but this payment was never really in jeopardy. FedEx earned around $5.80 per share in fiscal year 2008 before posting earnings near $3.80 in both 2009 and 2010. During that time the payout ratio ""jumped"" from 7% to 12% through the worst of it.And third, as I write this the current dividend yield for the firm sits at ""just"" 0.96%. For any of these reasons, you may not think of FedEx as your quintessential income stock.Yet here's the thing: just because FedEx is not a dividend stalwart today, this doesn't mean that it won't be in the years to come. And a chief factor will be the possibility for very robust dividend growth in the years to come.When you're starting from nothing, it's easy to make the dividend growth rates look impressive. Yet I'd still contend that the recent history is noteworthy.For instance, since 2015 FedEx has raised its dividend from $0.15 per quarter to $0.20, then $0.25, followed by $0.40 and the most recent announcement of $0.50 to be paid in July of this year. Those figures represent year-over-year growth rates of 33%, 25%, 60% and 25%. And that's after increasing the dividend by an average compound rate of north of 20% per annum in the prior 12 years.The net impact that thus far? The company is still only expected to pay out 17% or so of anticipated adjusted profits for the year.This outcome is a result of two factors: a low starting payout and solid earnings growth. Per share earnings growth has come in at about 6% per year for FedEx over the last decade. A lot of this was driven by ""organic"" increases in the business - net profit has climbed from $2 billion to $3 billion. And part of it was a result of share count reduction, which, incidentally, is fueled by a low dividend commitment.And the dividend growth story is far from over. When you're paying out 17% of anticipated profits, that leaves a lot of wiggle room for future expansion. Add to this the propensity for earnings to keep growing at a solid clip, and you have a dividend growth star in the making.Management at FedEx has laid out its goal of increasing earnings-per-share by 10% to 15% annually. Analysts come to a similar conclusion with 12% growth used as a midpoint for the intermediate-term.For illustration, let's consider two scenarios. Instead of 12% or 15% growth, let's suppose FedEx can grow by 8% per year. At that rate, you would be anticipating $26 or so in earnings per share after a decade. If the dividend grew in line with earnings, naturally that would imply an 8% dividend growth rate as well. Yet that'd still leave the payout ratio where it was.If FedEx instead elected to increase its payout ratio, the very robust growth of the past could continue into the future. A 40% payout ratio after 10 years, as an example, would imply an average compound dividend growth rate of nearly 18% per year. And even from there you still have the possibility for future growth / expansion.Naturally if earnings grow faster (or if the payout ratio expands higher) the potential is even greater. Alternatively, suppose the business does not perform as anticipated. Instead of 8% yearly growth, you could use zero growth - that is, FedEx earning $12 or so in adjusted earnings this year and still earning that amount a decade from now.It's worthwhile to note that due to ongoing share repurchases this scenario would actually imply negative company-wide growth. Using stagnant numbers, you can still see the benefit of starting with a low payout ratio. If FedEx elected to get its payout ratio up to 40% over the next 10 years with stagnant earnings growth, the dividend would still be growing by 9% per year.As a point of reference, UPS (NYSE:UPS) currently pays out around half of its profits as cash dividends.Obviously an investor's future success is going to depend on what happens with profitability: dividend growth is a byproduct of and not a driver of success. Yet the point is that FedEx presently has a resource in its low payout ratio.It gives the company capacity to increase the dividend at a solid clip in a poor environment or at an exceptional rate when paired with earnings growth. Alternatively, it allows for great flexibility and added per share growth when diverted towards share repurchases. Or the most likely case - a combination of the two - can act nicely to supplement the increased shareholder return goal of the business.In short, FedEx may not catch your attention on an income basis today as a result of its payout history length, the company's prudence during lesser times or the security's low starting yield. Yet all three of these items will eventually work themselves out as the company continues to expand its program. In the meantime, well above average dividend growth awaits those that are patient."

The company is spending an incredible amount of cash trying to keep the online giant from taking over the delivery market.The stock is hitting new all-time highs on the headline earnings beat. The question now is whether investors should chase FedEx above $210.The headline is that FedEx smashed analyst estimates with a $0.37 EPS beat. The beat, though, appears entirely due to tax benefits from new regulations and the inclusion of TNT Express in the same $0.37.The news initially hints that the package delivery company is effectively skirting fears that Amazon will eventually dominate the online shopping space and replace the company with an internal delivery system. The numbers, though, don't really reflect the Amazon threat yet. The e-commerce giant is still exploring deliveries with drones and operating an internal fleet of aircraft, amongst other initiatives.The real impact, though, is the incredible level of spending ongoing at FedEx to invest for the Amazon threat. The company spent $5.1 billion on capex last year and forecast an incredible jump to $5.9 billion this year.Keep in mind that operating cash flows for the just ended fiscal year were only $4.9 billion. In fairness, cash flows dipped from $5.7 billion last year, but this doesn't change the fact that free cash flows were negative last year.Source: FedEx FQ4'17 earnings reportRegardless, the package delivery giant is spending very aggressively to fend off the Amazon threat and provide a solution for other retailers trying to compete against the same threat. The biggest problem, though, is that FedEx is heading in the wrong direction in pricing to fend off that threat.The company discussed higher rates as a reason for the strong quarter, while competitor United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has already announced higher holiday shipping rates. These moves only help to make Amazon a bigger threat down the road, because the online retailing giant needs to reduce shipping costs over the long run.The key investor takeaway is that FedEx guided for an FY18 EPS of $13.60. The company is sticking with estimates around previous analyst estimates, while the stock trades at roughly 15.4x those estimates.The stock isn't exactly cheap, and I wouldn't want to chase FedEx at all-time highs with all of these capital expenditures not actually lowering shipping costs to keep the Amazon threat on the sidelines."
4057737,33291,2017-03-24T10:54:43-04:00,"The company had been firing on all cylinders, but after recent action the name could be pulling back, potentially opening up a buying opportunity once more.Q3 earnings are out and I discuss the results.What to expect moving forward.","You may recall that when FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) pulled back heavily in June 2016 I noted this as a buying opportunity. It is important to understand that when I first opined on the name, I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. I feel like I have been saying that over and over, and yet the stock moves higher. When I initiated coverage I also thought it should raise its dividend, and of course it did recently raise the payout 60%. The company had been firing on all cylinders, but after recent action the name could be pulling back, potentially opening up a buying opportunity once more. Others are saying that it should be sold and avoided. I think it is appropriate to say FedEx had a questionable quarter, but that there is no reason to expect growth to suddenly stop. Let the name pullback and then get ready to do some buying.Why? Well the company has just reported another quarter of earnings and expectations were pretty high. It wasn't all doom and gloom as the action suggested, but the headlines were certainly less than stellar. So how weak was it? Well, revenue was $15 billion, rising 18.6% year-over-year and meeting estimates. That is a positive I thought. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $2.07 for the third quarter compared to $1.84 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income actually dipped year-over-year to $1.12 billion from $1.16 billion. Adjusted earnings were $2.35 per share, down from $2.51 last year. This has the bears drooling as yes, a year-over-year decline occurred. The earnings whiffed by $0.27. A selloff is warranted.Interestingly, this decline came even though the per share earnings should be on the rise due to a large increase in buybacks. I was further surprised by this given that the company has also been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense, and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year, helping to improve results. That said, operating margin was pressured and came in at 7.5%, down from 9.2% last year. Make no mistake the TNT acquisition and incorporation is pricey. It will take time. But the company has faced segment specific weakness as well.Segment-specific results were also impressive for the most part. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.49 billion, up 3% from last year's $1.45 billion. However, due to lower average weight per packages, flat volume and higher wage expenses, operating income was pressured again. It fell 27% to $41 million, down from the $56 million a year ago. Of course, operating margin was also pressured, coming in at 2.7%, down from the from the 3.9% last year. These results weighed on overall performance.Turning to the Ground segment, revenues increased noticeably, coming in at $4.69 billion, up 6% from last year's $4.41 billion. Thanks to higher rent costs, transportation rates and network expansion, expenses rose pressuring operating income. There was also one less operating day between this period and last. Operating income fell 8% to $515 million, from $557 million a year ago. Margins of course took a hit as one might guess from the drop in operating income. Operating margin was 11%, down from 12.6% the previous year.The TNT Express segment reported strong revenues. Of course there are no year-over-year comparisons available yet. Excluding any integration expenses and restructuring charges, TNT Express saw revenues of $1.79 million. Operating expense was high, and weighted on margins. As reported the GAAP operating income was just $2 million, with margins of just 0.1%. Factoring in some adjustments, operating income was $40 million, with margins of 2.2%.I have to say that the rise in expenses really weighed this quarter. In terms of deliveries, for the most part I felt the quarter was as expected based on the results. Revenues were up sharply as a whole. But the expenses led to a huge hit to margins and as such weighed on earnings, explaining in part, the miss on estimates. Competition also remains a bottleneck for the company. I expect a few quarters of continued pressure, but this opens up potential long-term entry points. I feel that it is important to note that the company expects to incur significant expenses over the next few years in connection with the integration of TNT Express and the Outlook restructuring program. Looking ahead to 2017, FedEx expects moderate economic growth but hinted a precise estimate of sales and earnings is tough. It also felt it would be unable to provide earnings guidance, but we can expect adjusted earnings to be somewhere in the $11.80 to $12.20 per share range. Bottom line, don't let one quarter scare you. There could be continued pressure as the name integrates TNT. If you have profits, by all means take something off the table. If you have been waiting to get in, let the sell-off run its course and do a little buying on the way down.Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4057418,102551,2017-03-23T10:08:05-04:00,The integration of TNT is proceeding as planned but management has accelerated the implementation of activities which were to have taken place later in the integration process.FedEx shares have increased dramatically in recent months but based on projected earnings they still offer some value.I foolishly had short-term thinking when I first owned FDX in 1999. I do not intend to repeat the same mistake.,"IntroductionIn early February 2017, a reader responded to my UPS - It Is Now In My ""Buy Zone"" post asking if I could provide my comments on FedEx (NYSE: FDX). Now is an opportune time to do so given the March 21, 2017 release of FDX's Q3 2017 results, forecast for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and update on the TNT integration.My Experience as a Short-Term FDX InvestorIn late 1999, I acquired a few hundred shares of FDX. I do not recall the specific date of my purchase but I remember my purchase price was in the low $40s. My rationale for acquiring shares in FDX was based on the premise that somebody would have to ship all the goods being purchased online.Shortly subsequent to my purchase, I exited my position when FDX climbed into the upper $40s. I thought I was an astute investor as I had generated a small profit!The following chart compares FDX's results in FY2000, FY 2015, FY 2016, and Q3 2017.Clearly, I left a lot of money on the table.TNT IntegrationFDX acquired TNT in May 2016. This integration is a massive undertaking and FDX expects to have it completed mid-2020, 4 years after the date of acquisition.In the March 21, 2017 conference call which accompanied the Q3 2017 earnings release, management indicated that in the 9 months following the close of acquisition, it realized the TNT business it acquired was severely under-invested, particularly in IT and in operations. As a result, management has made strategic investment decisions which I touch upon in the next section of this post.The combination of the TNT and FDX businesses is now more than just an integration of the two entities. FDX is taking measures to leverage the combined businesses to be transformative and fully expects significant synergies from the integration.As the integration progresses, businesses are combined and countries are fully integrated. Discrete financial information about the legacy business, therefore, will no longer exist on a comparable basis. Beginning in FY2018, the TNT segment will be eliminated and will be reported under the FedEx Express segment.Q3 FY2016 Financial Results and Outlook for Remainder of FY2017On March 21, 2017, FDX presented its Q3 2017 financial review and outlook along with an update on the TNT integration.Management indicated it is targeting a $1.2B - $1.5B operating income improvement at the FedEx Express Group in fiscal 2020 versus the final FY2017 adjusted results. This assumes moderate income economic growth and current accounting and tax rules. FDX expects to lower the effective tax rate to around 33% to 34% with the completion of the integration.The pace of the integration activities in FY2017 and preparations for FY2018 requires higher levels of dedicated integration personnel training, professional fees to support the integration, and investments in IT and operations.As a result, FDX is increasing FY2017's forecast for integration and restructuring related spending by $50 - $300 million. This is a result of the acceleration of activities which were previously planned for later in the 4 year integration plan.The aggregate integration expense over 4 years is now projected to be approximately $800 million. Management has cautioned that the actual timing and amounts of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as it implements and adjusts its integration plans.ValuationWhile earnings estimates are provided as far as 2020, I place little credence in earnings estimates several years into the future. I am, therefore, relying on estimates for FY2018 to determine what would be a reasonable price to pay for FDX; these estimates are less subjective.I arrive at a trailing PE of 30 when I use FY2016's diluted EPS of $6.51 and the current stock price of $195.53 as at close of business March 22, 2017.If I use the current stock price, the $11.85 - $12.35 projected diluted EPS for FY2017 found on page 18 of management's March 21, 2017 presentation, and the estimates from multiple analysts, I estimate a forward PE range of 15.8 - 16.5.(Source: TD WebBroker)(Source: ValuEngine)(Source: Thomson Reuters)The current mean estimates reflect a 2018 EPS range of $13.05 - $14.25 with 13.65 being the midpoint.If I use a midpoint PE of 16.15 and the projected mean FY2018 EPS of $13.65, I anticipate FDX will likely be trading around $220 at some stage of FY2018.FDX's dividend yield is a negligible sub 1% and is not a factor in my FDX analysis. While I do enjoy receiving an ongoing dividend income stream, there are reasons why Low or No Dividend Yield Companies Belong In Your Portfolio.Final ThoughtsFDX meets all my Stock Picking Rules to Follow.I am confident FDX will successfully integrate TNT in the 4 year timeframe it set for itself. Once the integration is complete I envision FDX will be significantly more expensive than current levels.I intend to initiate a position shortly and subsequent purchases will also be likely. This time I am looking at FDX from a long-term perspective.Please click the + icon next to my user name and follow me at, Financial Freedom is a Journey, as I work to keep you informed on further developments in the world of dividend stocks."
4081972,25228,2017-06-16T11:58:05-04:00,FedEx has been growing its dividend tremendously and is poised to continue to do so.Yet many overlook the security due to its low starting yield.This article looks at boosting that payment and opening up your investing options.,"In a recent article I detailed why FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) dividend potential was just beginning; despite already increasing the dividend at a high rate for the last 15 years. Basically it comes down to two things - a willingness and ability - with the ability being derived from both a low current payout ratio and the propensity for solid earnings growth to come.To give you some examples, FedEx currently pays out 17% or so of anticipated profits. If that payout ratio were to get up to 40% after 10 years with 8% earnings growth, the dividend could grow by 18% annually for the next decade. Even if per share earnings were to stagnant, the dividend could still increase by 9% per year. The idea being that FedEx's low payout ratio is a resource that could be utilized for dividend growth down the line.We've already seen this robust growth come about in the past, but it's not hard to imagine it moving forward on either an earnings or dividend basis. As the economy grows, and especially as more goods move about, FedEx does not need to increase market share in order to capture growth. Instead, the company needs to continuing executing.Pair this with a low current payout ratio, leaving ample room for share repurchases. In the last three years FedEx has used an average of nearly $3 billion annually towards retiring shares. Perhaps this robust pace does not continue payout-wise (the company currently earns about $3 billion a year) but there is still plenty of ""organic"" room for per share growth to outpace company-wide growth, in turn eventually helping along the potential for payout expansion as well.Some might see this and think it's all well and good, but there's a sticking point: the low starting yield. As I write this shares of FedEx trade hands near $210 against a $0.50 quarterly dividend. That equates to an annualized yield of just 0.95%. Not exactly the type of income that many are hoping for.Many investors think about this low yield in one of two ways: either 1) live with it and recognize the dividend growth trade-off (low yield now, potential for high growth later) or 2) say ""too low, what's next?"" and move on.Yet I'd contend that there is a middle ground. And better yet, you can tailor it to your income desires. There are quite literally options available to you.I'll present an illustration. Here's a look at some available call options for FedEx for the January 2018 expiration:Note that I have no affinity for this expiration date (many prefer shorter-term agreements), but it does work to provide an example.The first column indicates the strike price, or the price at which you could agree to sell shares of FedEx in increments of 100 shares. The next column indicates the immediate cash flow (per share) that you would receive for making the agreement. This number takes the most recent bid less $0.15 per share for frictional expenses and fluctuations.The third column highlights the premium yield that this would represent and the final column indicates the ""maximum"" gain, not including any dividends received along the way. Keep in mind that the above numbers are for the next seven months and not a full year.This table finds the intermediate ground between not enough income and not being able to own the security at all. Of course this is not a free lunch. The above agreements may or may not turn in superior performance. However, there is a bit more tailoring to your personal preferences that you can achieve.I'll give you an example. Suppose you'd be happy to partner with FedEx, but you would like to generate a bit more income. You believe in the prospects of the business (at the current valuation) but you'd also be content to generate say a 20% return in the coming seven months and find an alternative for your capital.An option similar to this shows up in the $250 strike price. You could buy shares near $210 today and simultaneously agree to sell that stake at $250 in the next seven months.Now one of two basic things happens: either that agreement is exercised or it is not. And in both cases, you begin with $195 in upfront cash flow (per agreement) that is yours to allocate or spend as you please.If the option is not exercised, you will continue holding shares of FedEx and collect the dividend along the way. Your results would be precisely the same as someone who simply bought and held, plus the upfront cash flow from the option proceeds. In this way, if the option is not exercised, this route will always be superior to an investor who only bought and held.Now many will point out (correctly) that making this agreement will not prevent you from a loss; which is true. If shares later trade at say $150, you still have the ""extra"" option premium, but your overall return will still be negative. Slightly better than buying and holding only, but still negative.Personally, I don't classify this as a risk of the option agreement. To be sure it is a risk of equities in general, but there's no added risk on this side from agreeing to sell at a higher price. Indeed, the upfront option premium actually offsets some of the potential harm.The larger risk, in my view, is what happens on the upside.If the option is exercised, this would mean that you're forced to sell at a per share price of $250. The risk here is that shares could later trade at say $270 or $300 and you'd be ""stuck"" selling at $250. That's a real risk and ought to be considered beforehand.Yet at the same time, you can tailor this to a level whereby you'd be happy with either outcome. In this particular case you would have roughly $1.95 in upfront per share option proceeds, $250 in sale proceeds and perhaps dividends along the way as well. Your total return would be on the magnitude of 20% over the course of seven months. While you ""risk"" losing out to an even higher return, I'd consider this no great tragedy (personal investor psychology may differ).And naturally you can generate higher upfront cash flows by agreeing to sell at a lower price. Or a higher ""maximum"" gain by generating less upfront cash and agreeing to sell at a higher price.The point is not about a particular strike price or expiration. The point is that you're not stuck with the alternatives of just buy, hold or sell (or ignore altogether). Instead there's a secondary consideration of ""own and agree to potentially sell at a higher price."" This is obvious in the options market, but it's overlooked quite frequently in the equity world.As such, before automatically passing on a security like FedEx due to its ""low"" yield, a secondary test ought to be whether or not you can manufacture a satisfactory agreement on your own. This secondary examination may often come up short as well, but it could also open up many additional income possibilities that escape a cursory first glance."

In my view, at least one name stands out: FedEx (NYSE:FDX).Credit: Blog LogisticaIn my opinion, FedEx stands to benefit from a healthy e-commerce environment, regardless of what specific vendor those sales might come from. As the company itself has noted, ""e-commerce, including B2B, and global trade growth are increasing demand for (FedEx's) services."" As a result, package volume and yield across all segments have been growing, even if at a low-to-mid single-digit pace in some cases. Interestingly and playing to this same theme, the company announced FedEx Fulfillment in February to provide logistics services to small- and medium-sized businesses that conduct business online.Since the end of the 2008 Global Recession, FedEx's revenues have increased at a brisk pace of about 8.5% CAGR, while GAAP op margins have remained healthy in the mid-to-high single digits. Over this period of time, global economic activity has remained resilient even if GDP growth has been lackluster. Looking forward and considering all factors, I would not dare bet against management's ability to increase non-GAAP op margins above the 10% mark and to grow EPS at up to 15% annually.FDX Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsBest of all, although FDX has been on the rise over the past year (up 29% in a steady climb), shares still seem affordable. On a forward P/E basis, the stock trades at 15.1x, which is just about on par with early 2016 levels and a few turns below key competitor UPS' (NYSE:UPS) multiple. Given the healthy EPS growth rate that the Street seems to expect, I believe a mid-teen valuation ratio to be very reasonable for a company that stands to benefit from current macro trends.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsFinal thoughtsOver the short term, FedEx could be faced with challenges that might bode ill for the stock. For example, the TNT integration seems to be consuming a good bit of the company's resources, as the acquiree ""was severely under-invested, particularly in IT and in operations,"" according to management. Most importantly and looking at the bigger picture, a slowdown in economic activity, ending a winning streak that has lasted nearly 10 years now, would likely impact FedEx negatively, probably as much as it would other companies engaged in commerce.But at the end of the day and despite the risks, FedEx appears to be a well-managed company with a solid balance sheet (in spite of the 20-year high of 2.0x in debt-to-EBITDA) exposed to what seems to be the right trends. Trading at only 15.1x fiscal 2018 earnings and given the five-year EPS growth expectation of 13%, FDX seems like an attractive proposition to me, particularly in the context of a diversified portfolio.Note from the author: if you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

        Pricing has also improved, and combined with volume, consolidated revenues have outpaced GDP growth.
        A core driver of this growth moving forward will be the synergies from the TNT Express deal.
        The company remains on track to return annualized double-digit stock price performance to investors.","Source: Google ImagesFedEx Corporation's (NYSE:FDX) stock price wavered last week as the company reported its third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings. The market sold off during after-hours, only to open the next day up as results were digested. The preceding two days saw the stock price fall lower as transports broadly declined.Looking at the technical chart, FedEx is by no means a bargain. But based on the fundamentals, the current price is solid enough to provide for the potential for double-digit returns. This can be observed through both the company's three-quarter and most recent quarter performance, year-over-year (YOY) for its group operating segments.The previous FedEx Express segment, has now been changed to the FedEx Express Group as it includes FedEx and TNT Express segments. For FedEx Express, both average daily volume (NASDAQ:ADV) and package yields witnessed positive performance for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2017. On a YOY basis during the third quarter, performance was much stronger.ADV was up 1.5 percent through 2017 and up nearly three percent versus last year for the third quarter. The composite package yield was up over one percent through 2017 and up two percent YOY for the third quarter. On the freight side, volume slipped marginally, but yields remained stronger. These results are a good indication for near-term demand and pricing inflation. Overall, total revenues were up over two percent through 2017, and up nearly 3.5 percent YOY for the third quarter.TNT Express does not have as rich of a set of similar metrics for comparison. This segment did witness marginal declines for both volumes and yield sequentially from the last quarter, which was not the case for FedEx Express.As the acquisition was recent, investors should not be surprised to see a marginal declining trend. This newly formed group is going to be a big driver for FedEx's near-term success as operating income for the group is expected to increase by $1.2 to $1.5 billion in 2020. This reflects a 45 to 60 percent improvement from the approximately $2.6 billion expected during 2017.The Ground Segment witnessed a decline in ADV YOY for the third quarter versus the first nine months of fiscal year 2017. Growth through 2017 was at 5.5 percent, and only a little over two percent versus last year. Still growth has outpaced gross domestic product (NYSEMKT:GDP) results.Package yield performance has been strong as YOY results were up over six percent, versus the first nine months of 2017 being up just over four percent. FedEx is coming off a strong comparable baseline for 2016, so these results are solid. Revenues remained up nine percent through 2017, but were up nearly seven percent for the third quarter YOY.For the Freight Segment, less-than-truckload (NYSEARCA:LTL) average daily shipments (NYSE:ADS) and weight per LTL shipment have both declined marginally YOY in the third quarter. This reflected a decline versus the first nine months of 2017 for ADS, but an improvement for weight per LTL shipment.Pricing yields, whether measured by revenue per shipment or revenue per hundredweight both increased strongly during the third quarter versus the first nine months of 2017. Revenue per shipment and hundredweight increased by 350- and 240-basis points (bps) respectively. Revenues remained up over three percent through 2017, and YOY for the third quarter.All of FedEx's core operating segments have easily outperformed GDP performance of late. The addition of the TNT Express segment has added to this performance with a nearly 19 percent increase in total operating revenues.As can be seen when comparing FedEx's operating segments excluding TNT Express, the company has witnessed a collective improvement during the 2017 third quarter for both volume and pricing. FedEx is the first freight-based transport company to provide earnings. The company's third quarter results include both January and February months, so FedEx typically is the initial read on the health of the economy.These results bode well for air cargo and other package delivery peers. But the freight side of FedEx's business did display weaker performance for LTL. With the improved railroad industry traffic performance, the trucking industry has continued to witness a softer demand environment. For LTL, pricing has remained disciplined and in FedEx's case, improved strongly.The weak performance for transports to end this past week took FedEx's stock price lower after the initial bounce. Analysts were quick to affirm price targets much higher than the current price. The market is wrestling with the new federal administration's early growing pains versus the improving trends of consumption and inflation.Many are critiquing and writing about the so-called ""Trump rally"" fizzle. Investors looking considering FedEx should avoid the noise surrounding the uncertainties regarding future policies such as an infrastructure bill or trade. These items do have implications for a company like FedEx. But the more important story that is unfolding is a return to stronger growth led by demand and improved pricing.Europe has been growing strong of late as well, especially from e-commerce and air cargo tailwinds. The story is similar as evidenced by the strong improvement for Deutsche Post DHL Group (OTCPK:DPSGY). DHL Group set its own targets to improve the company's EBIT and has been able to deliver returning value to shareholders.FedEx is positioned to compete more effectively in Europe through the new FedEx Express Group. Analysts are encouraged by the guidance for improved operating income and reaffirmed guidance for the balance of 2017's earnings. Investors should continue to monitor both the immediate and near-term trends as profitability will continue to drive investment returns.In my book, FedEx remains on track to deliver double-digit earnings results for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. As the global economy is poised to improve during this time, FedEx's multiple valuation is justified at around 18.5 times earnings. This places a stock price at above $240 per share for the next fiscal year, providing the potential, for double-digit annual returns."

4036069,33291,2017-01-11T13:35:53-05:00,The two companies announced a joint partnership.I discuss the implications of the new co-located services.I revisit performance data and opine on the key indicator we need to watch for both companies.,"When FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) pulled back heavily in June, I noted this as a buying opportunity. It is important to note that when I first opined on the name, I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. I also thought it should raise its dividend, and of course, it did recently raise the payout 60%. The company had been firing on all cylinders, but FedEx recently ran into an unexpected hiccup with its earnings. That said, the company has been out competed by UPS (NYSE:UPS) in terms of its location services for pickup/dropoff locations. Just today, however, we learned that the company was taking steps to take back market share against UPS, which has substantially more of these locations nationwide. Beginning this year as a pilot and then rolling out to mass amounts of stores, FedEx will have locations located within Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA). The move is a win for FedEx, and for WBA.This partnership will add thousands of pickup and dropoff locations. It has two benefits. First, customers will have more convenience and more locations with which to do business with FedEx. This means they may be more likely to use the service over UPS, and if their pharmacy provider is Walgreens, then it becomes one stop shopping. While the exact costs to operate these services are unclear, the benefits are clear, provided they are cost efficient. For Walgreens, increased foot traffic should provide a bump to retail sales. That is a win. For FedEx, making the service more convenient will help take share from UPS. While FedEx and Walgreens have both performed well of late, performance can always be improved. This is especially true for FedEx, which struggled recently.What do I mean? In its recent quarter, revenue was $14.9 billion, rising 19.2% year over year and meeting estimates. That is a positive. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $2.59 for the first quarter compared to $2.44 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course, we need to consider adjustments when comparing year over year and as such adjusted operating income rose slight year over year to $1.23 billion. Adjusted earnings were $2.80 per share, rising from $2.58 last year. However, this missed estimates by $0.10. That hurt the name, which had been firing on all cylinders.It is also worth noting that part of the reason the company saw a large increase on a per-share basis was due to buybacks. However, the company has also been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from these profit improvement program initiatives. With the new in Walgreen's services, costs will be the major question mark. Rising expenses hit margins hard last quarter, and may be an issue in 2017, despite impressive segment specific results. Let us not forget that FedEx is already slated to see rising costs from the integration of TNT Express and the Outlook restructuring program. That said we can expected earnings of $11.85 to $12.35 per share with capital spending of $5.1 billion.As for Walgreens, this name is trying to close a deal with Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD). That deal looks like it will close this month, according to a column in the NY Post. This new move with FedEx really highlights a transformational year. The thing about Walgreens Boots Alliance is that this company is the first global pharmacy-led, health and well-being enterprise in the world. Now it is seeking to become more of a one-stop shop for customers. I have been impressed with all of the areas this company is involved in. It is now an extremely well diversified machine. But the stock has been kind of in neutral for a bit, mostly trading sideways. With the addition of Rite Aid and FedEx services, this could be the jolt the company needs, even though earnings continue to slowly improve.This is evidenced in the recently released fiscal Q1 earnings. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fiscal first quarter dropped 5% to $1.1 billion compared with the same quarter a year ago, while GAAP net earnings per diluted share dropped 4% to $0.97 compared with the same quarter a year ago. We hate to see this trend, even if unadjusted. Adjusted earnings are the basis for most analyst estimates, and factoring in some necessary items, adjusted fiscal 2017 first quarter net earnings jumped 6.1% to $123 billion and spiked 6.8% on a per share basis to $1.10. Net sales in the quarter dropped 1.8% to $28.5 billion compared with the same quarter a year ago, largely due to currency issues. In constant dollars, sales were actually up 1.1%. However, with the addition of Rite Aid and now FedEx synergistic sales are expected to continue to grow for the company in 2017 and beyond.Take home? The news is bullish for both companies. Although in very different sectors, I like Walgreens here a bit more than FedEx, but am also bullish on FedEx. What we need to watch for both companies are expenses, particularly for FedEx operating these new locations, and for Walgreens, how much they will be spending with Rite Aid integration, in addition to whatever costs are incurred hosting the FedEx locations.Note from the author: Christopher F.

4057032,39011,2017-03-22T07:02:02-04:00,"FDX has spent heavily in the past few years buying back stock.
        The results have been terrific but aren't sustainable.
        With FDX borrowing most of its buyback money, longs would do well to avoid building in huge reductions in the float going forward.","Photo creditShipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has never really been one to pay much of a dividend. That's somewhat unusual for a huge, mature mega-cap like FDX but shareholders seem not to mind as judged by the trajectory of the share price over the past several years. Where FDX has spent some money with respect to capital returns is in buybacks and while its results have been lumpy, the dollars are significant. In this article, I'll take a look at what FDX has accomplished with its buyback spending using data from company filings and Morningstar.We'll begin by taking a look at the company's share count for the past six fiscal year-end periods to get a sense of where the share count has come from.We can see that FDX didn't really accomplish anything with its buyback in 2012 and 2013 apart from offsetting some minor levels of dilution. That's similar to what happened in 2015 as well but in 2014 and 2016, FDX did make some meaningful progress in terms of reducing the float. In fact, the 52M shares I calculated that FDX has reduced its float by in the past few years is good for about 16% of the starting number of 317M. That's a strong result and it is more so when you consider all of the heavy-lifting was done in just two years.Seen another way, this chart just shows the reduction in the float each year during our time frame above.We can see that 2012 and 2013 were just meant to keep the float flat but in 2014 (10%) and 2016 (6%), FDX made some real progress in terms of buying back stock.So how has it done this? Here's how much FDX has spent to accomplish this reduction in the float over the past few years.The repurchase amounts were tiny in the first two years of our dataset but 2014's number was nearly $5B. That's a huge amount of money for a company like FDX and that's why the float was reduced by 10% that year. The impact of almost $3B last year was meaningful as well but dilution offset some of these repurchases, as we shall see now.FDX has issued a reasonably high amount of stock in the past few years, particularly from 2013 to 2015. Those years combined saw an average of almost $400M in new issuances, offsetting some of the gains from the repurchases that were made. Still, over the entire time frame, FDX issued $1.5B in new shares, or about $294M per year. That is much lower than the $9.3B it spent on buying back stock, good for an annual average of $1.9B. On a net basis, however, that $1.9B is reduced by the issuances, bringing the average net number to $1.6B.Now, we know FDX has reduced its float meaningfully and we also know what it has had to spend to get there; so what? Including dilution, FDX has spent $180 per share in the past five years retiring stock. That sounds very high but when you consider that FDX had to buy back $1.5B just to offset dilution, the picture becomes clearer. Still, in comparison to its current share price in the mid-$190s, that's actually quite good; most mega-caps have frictional costs from their buyback programs. In other words, FDX has actually retired shares that would be worth $10.1B today for just $9.3B, offering up $808M in ""profit"" from its buybacks. That's tremendous and it means that its frictional costs from the buyback program were actually negative, a rarity among mega-caps that tend to like to issue stock for compensation.This is great and it means FDX has done a terrific job of executing the buyback, but at what cost? Its FCF averages under a billion dollars annually, so it certainly isn't paying for these repurchases with cash generated from the business. Instead, it has issued an average of $2.5B in new debt each year since 2012, good for $12.7B in that time frame. Against annual FCF of just under $1B annually, that's an enormous amount of debt. It isn't that FDX cannot afford to service it, but this kind of thing cannot go on forever. There is simply no way for FDX to finance buybacks like this going forward when it has to borrow almost all of the money to do so. And I certainly understand not all of this debt was issued for buybacks but the fact of the matter is that with FCF under $1B, almost all of the money spent on buybacks had to have been borrowed.And given the very strong results from the buyback, that's really the only negative I see. FDX has executed an effective, opportunistic buyback that has - despite the impact of dilution- actually produced a paper profit for shareholders. That's a rare thing to find these days but it is impossible for FDX to do this on a regular basis due to its low levels of FCF. FDX is an example of a well-executed buyback; it is a shame that it cannot continue going forward. And if you're long, you'd do well to ensure rosy buyback numbers aren't built into your EPS growth projections because it's not going to happen."
4034214,101453,2017-01-04T09:45:21-05:00,"Higher than anticipated integration costs of FedEx’s TNT Express acquisition have lowered investors’ valuation for the company.The stock is very unlikely to enjoy the run it had in 2016, but I believe FedEx remains definitively cheaper than the average stock on the market.I estimate that the company’s current stock price comes to about 8% forward returns expectations.","ThesisFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is clearly cheaper than the average stock on the market, in my view, and could still be a value play despite last year's 30% appreciation. FedEx could be a viable long for those with 8% returns expectations or lower.OverviewFedEx is a high-quality company operating in an oligopolistic market structure with a global brand. The company benefits from a robust liquidity situation, possesses relatively stable and growing revenues from upward trends in pricing and volume mix, and has a reasonably flexible cost structure. Moreover, management has been kind to shareholders through its buyback of $2.7 billion worth of common stock within the past four quarters. The company has benefited from the continuing proliferation of e-commerce, and revenues are expected to jump to around $60 billion for the FY2017. By consequence, FedEx jumped 30% over the past twelve months.FDX data by YChartsWhile shareholders enjoyed a good year, management's current rate of share repurchases is unsustainable. If we assume FedEx will achieve around $58 billion in FY2017 revenue, with 13% EBITDA margins, about $5 billion in capex (and equivalent depreciation), a 35% tax rate, and no working capital growth, that would provide free cash flow (also taking into account interest expenses) of about $1.3 billion. As noted above, share buybacks are currently double that. Moreover, the stock is no longer as cheap as it was in the earlier portion of 2016, decreasing the value proposition with respect to buying back more shares.Operational cash flows are likely to be constrained in the near-term as the company's capital intensity takes what is expected to be a temporary increase. In its recent history, FedEx's capital expenditures have normally come to around 5%-6% of revenue. This is expected to increase to 8%-9% of revenue in the near-term as it invests more heavily in its technology and logistics network and works to integrate the TNT acquisition completed last May. The TNT integration is likely to continue through the end of the decade at estimated costs of $700-$800 million per year over four years. FedEx expects to achieve $750 million in pre-tax synergies by 2020.Capital StructureFedEx is presently levered with debt at around 22% of its capital structure. Based on the model I use to assess the optimization of a company's capital structure, I provide each company with a synthetic debt rating determined using interest coverage ratios (EBIT/interest expense). These ratings are then converted to various debt costs based on the historical spread between said ratings and the 10-year US Treasury. I then plot out a capital structure curve (taking data points in five-percent increments) to illustrate the company's optimal debt design.Going in five-percentage point increments, the company appears to be optimally levered at around a 45% debt-to-capital ratio. However, the left end of the curve is relatively flat, which diminishes the accretive effects of additional debt issuance on the valuation of the company.(Source: author)FedEx recently issued additional senior unsecured bonds, but the additional leverage will have no effect on the risk profile of the company, given that the proceeds will work to restock the company's underfunded pension (a separate liability). Taking care of pension underfunding is a wise move assuming the debt is cheap enough, given that the company's plan premiums fluctuate in accordance with its funded status.In terms of basic credit statistics, FedEx displays healthy credit quality, with EBIT/Interest between 4x-5x, Debt/EBITDA at a projected 1.8x, and Net debt/(EBITDA-Capex) at 4.2x. All of these metrics support a continued investment grade standing for the company's debt. And while the company's aggressive share buyback program through additional debt issuance has been accretive to shareholders and the company's value as a whole, it will work to hold down its metrics and its credit rating accordingly.ValuationAs mentioned, the near-term headwinds include a capex regimen that may run up as high as 8.5% of revenue as it looks to integrate its recent TNT acquisition along with updates to its technology and logistics networks. If capex as a percentage of revenue can moderate back to its standard 5%-6% of revenue range by the end of the decade, the current share price still looks favorable at 8% forward return requirements.If capex only moderates back to 7% of revenue after four years and continues that rate moving forward, forward returns only project out at about 6.8%. However, it is expected that capex will normalize assuming no additional acquisitions and a decline in necessary tech and logistics updating in the years ahead.Each 100-basis point decrease in the capex run rate (i.e., capex rate projected over the entire 10-year projection period) is estimated to increase forward returns expectations by about 90 basis points. To put this into more concrete terms, a shift in forward returns expectations (essentially your cost of equity) by +/- 90 bps can change the current valuation of the stock by 15%-20%.In my base projection, I estimate the company's FY2017 revenue at $58 billion, with a 3% year-over-year increase through the FY2027. Assuming 13% EBITDA margins, capex as 8.6% of revenue for FY2017 before easing back into its more normalized range of 5%-6% by 2020 onward (with depreciation expense set equal to capex in equilibrium), a 35% tax rate, no working capital growth, and a 1.8% perpetual growth rate, the company's current share price could be obtained through an 8% cost of equity.(Source: author)While the stock is no longer as cheap as it was earlier this year, when it was trading at close to 11% forward returns, 8% is still relatively cheap in an expensive market.The company also trades at a forward-looking EBITDA multiple of approximately 7.9x. Its main competitor, UPS (NYSE:UPS), trades at 11x.ConclusionFedEx may not look as attractive as it did back in early-2016, naturally due to the 30% rise over the past year, but with the expected forward returns of the market estimated at 5.7%, it still appears somewhat cheap relatively speaking. Part of the recent rise is a product of financial engineering, with capital structure optimization brought on by an aggressive financial policy of debt-funded share buybacks. But a large portion must also be attributed to the company's benefiting from an ongoing e-commerce boom while operating in a market structure with few major competitors.Near-term headwinds include integration of its GENCO and TNT acquisitions, which require a temporary uptick in capital spending requirements before these entities can positively contribute to the company's bottom line on a net basis. Assuming that the integration costs, the technology/logistics network improvements expenditures are not being underestimated, and the company can retain its relative stability in revenue and operating margins, FedEx could have additional room to run going forward."
4055410,25228,2017-03-15T11:49:36-04:00,"FedEx’s share price has increased materially as of late.However, this alone does not mean that investors have ""missed the boat"".This article illustrates why shares could still be offering a ""fair shake"".","Since the end of January of 2016, shares of Tennessee-based delivery service company FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are up about ~44%. And when you see something like that it can be easy to dismiss the security, thinking that you have ""missed the boat."" Yet at the same time, I'm reminded that just because a great deal is no longer offered, this does not simultaneously indicate that today's value proposition is now a poor one.In other words, it can be helpful to give the security a chance before automatically casting it aside. Let's start with some history:The above table is what I like to refer to as ""five component investing."" It highlights the major aspects of the business and gives you some insight into why a particular investment may have performed as it did. Note that FedEx's fiscal year ends in May.On the top line, FedEx put together solid growth - increasing sales from $35 billion in sales during 2007 up to $50 billion last year. This mark was further supplemented by a steady profit margin, increasing just slightly.The business grew profits at a 4.3% annual rate ($2.07 billion to $3.02 billion), but shareholders saw a bit better results as a consequence of the share repurchase program. FedEx was able to reduce the number of common shares outstanding from about 308 million down to 265 million or so - allowing earnings-per-share to grow by 5.5% per annum over the nine-year period.Now, for a lot of companies, this type of growth would set up investors for solid returns. However, FedEx had a couple of things working against it.For one thing, the valuation compressed over this period - going from around 17 times earnings down to 15 or so. This resulted in share price growth of 4.4% per year. And the dividend - while growing nicely - only makes up a small fraction of earnings, so this wasn't a large contributing factor either.All told, an investor that held from fiscal years 2007 through 2016 would have seen total returns on the magnitude of 4.8% per annum. Just to give you a point of reference, that's the sort of thing that would turn a $10,000 starting investment into $15,000 or so after nine years - fine, but not great.Now, there are some important follow up points. To be fair, 2007 was the peak for FedEx. The company would go on to make less money in 2008 through 2013 (still quite profitable, but less than 2007) before getting back to pre-recession growth in 2014. As such, the investment results are greatly skewed by the time period chosen.If you went back to say 2003, earnings-per-share grew by about 11% per year and an investment would have returned roughly 8% per annum. Or from 2012 to today, you would have observed 13% earnings-per-share growth with 17% annual investment results. The point is that while the above table is instructive, it's not necessarily all telling.Still, we can glean a variety of items. For instance, solid but not exceptional revenue growth is probably a reasonable starting point. The profit margin has ranged from ~3% to ~6% over the last decade, with the current mark being on the higher end. The share repurchase program is apt to play a strong role in capital returns. And the dividend, while well covered and growing nicely, probably will not add materially in the next few years.Which brings us to today. A lot of these same characteristics of the past can carry through to the future.FedEx has told investors to anticipate adjusted earnings-per-share of between $11.85 and $12.35 for fiscal year 2017. In addition, the company has a goal of increasing earnings-per-share by 10% to 15% per year. As we saw above, this part can be somewhat out of the company's hands. It controls expenses, efficiencies, capital allocation decisions etc., but the business will still ebb and flow with the overall economy. In other words, the feasibility of reaching 10% to 15% EPS growth depends on if your observation period is starting in 2004, 2007 or 2012 as examples. And, naturally, we don't yet know which type of starting place we're at today.Analysts are also presently anticipating rather solid growth - to the tune of about ~11% per year over the intermediate term. For our beginning baseline, let's scale that back a bit - call it 6% per year instead, quite close to what was achieved over a longer period when FedEx started at a ""top.""At that rate, you might anticipate $16.20 or so in per share earnings after half a decade. A ""typical"" valuation for FedEx over the years has been around 17 or 18 times earnings (with a range anywhere from ~10 to ~25 times earnings). Using 17 times earnings, this would equate to a future price anticipation of about $275.The dividend is exceptionally well covered, but will likely only add in a small way. If the dividend were to grow by 10% annually, you'd anticipate receiving another $11 or so in per share cash payments. This would equal a total anticipated value of about $286. Expressed differently, based on a starting share price near $191, this would equate to total anticipated return of about 8.4% per annum.Now, obviously, things could go much better or worse. If FedEx were only able to grow at say 3% yearly and later trades at 14 times earnings, as an example, you'd be looking at potential returns of about 2.5% annually. On the other hand, should that double-digit growth formulate you'd be looking at potential returns of 12%+ per year.The point is to come up with a baseline that you feel comfortable with and see what that might mean for a potential investment. It can be easy to see a security increase in price by 40%+ and think that you have missed your opportunity. Yet as we just saw above, shares could still be offering a reasonable deal at this higher level.Even with marginal expectations - 6% growth instead of 10%+, a payout ratio staying under 20% and an average valuation multiple - investors could still see ~8% annual returns.

But with the market now trading at all-time highs, and an inevitable correction overdue, the question for dividend growth investors is whether or not UPS and FedEx have what it takes to continue enriching shareholders, growing their dividends, and beating the market going forward.Let's take a look at why both companies still offer very attractive long-term dividend growth opportunities. More importantly, though, let's find out why at this point in time, UPS is hands down the better company and represents a far better buy for most investors.UPS: The 800-Pound Gorilla That's Only Getting BiggerWhen it comes to international delivery services, UPS bestrides the world as a colossus. Operating in 220 countries and territories around the globe, its 444,000 employees utilize 104,000 vehicles and 543 aircraft to deliver 18.3 million packages per day to over 10 million international customers.Source: UPS Investor presentationAnd while America remains UPS's core market, the company has made great strides in achieving both diversification and growth in the past decade.In fact, United Parcel Service has proven the far better company at breaking into and expanding its presence around the world, as FedEx has focused more on achieving economies of scale domestically.And thanks to management's excellent track record of automating its logistical network, an ongoing process that is expected to boost margins and returns on capital in the future (more on this in a moment), as well as consistent share buybacks, 2.4% CAGR reduction over the past five years, UPS expects to be able to achieve impressive earnings growth in the coming years.FedEx: Smaller Challenger That's Hungry To Unseat The KingFounded in 1973, FedEx founder, Chairman and CEO Fred Smith invented overnight delivery and has turned FedEx into the world's largest express delivery company.Source: FedEx investor presentationOver the decades, FedEx has diversified its operations beyond express shipping, and now rivals UPS in the global size of its network, as well as its overall service offerings.FedEx has historically grown both organically, as well as through numerous bolt-on acquisitions, such as 2015's $1.4 billion purchase of GENCO Distribution Systems, as well as 2016's $4.7 billion buyout of TNT.This combination has resulted in the smaller FedEx being able to achieve superior growth to UPS, which explains the historically better stock performance.However as you can see, while FedEx may claim the superior growth mantle, the same can't be said for its profitability.Profitability: UPS The Clear WinnerSource: MorningstarIn fairness to FedEx, margins on express shipping are lower than regular ground shipping, which partially explains why UPS has such far superior margins and returns on shareholder capital.However, another reason is that until recently FedEx was far smaller than UPS, and given the monstrously capital intensive nature of the delivery business, it needed time to achieve sufficient economies of scale.However, we must also give UPS its due, because management has spent the last decade being very aggressive in automation of its state-of-the-art distribution hubs, as well as maintaining a more modern (and thus more efficient) fleet of aircraft than FedEx.Source: UPS investor presentationThose efforts continue today with projects such as ORION, or On-Road Integration & Navigation, which is the company's way of optimizing routes to minimize delivery time, and fuel use. UPS expects ORION alone, once complete, to deliver around $350 million in annual cost savings.Similarly, the company is investing heavily into automated hubs and distribution facilities and expects that within three years up to 60% of packages will be handled robotically. This could boost efficiency and profits by as much as 25%, which will only further UPS' profitability lead.Source: FedEx investor presentationThat's not to say FedEx isn't working hard to boost its own margins. As you can see, the company is investing very aggressively into improving its own operations, including newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, as well as investing $500 million into improving and automating TNT's distribution Hubs. This is part of management's goal of achieving $750 million in annual synergistic cost savings that by itself would nearly double the company's annual free cash flow from 2016 levels.Balance Sheet: Again UPS Remains SuperiorIn the past decade, FedEx has funded a lot of its impressive growth with a massive amount of debt. As a long-term dividend investor, I know that an integral part of a secure payout is a strong balance sheet.Source: MorningstarThat is why I like UPS's more conservative use of debt, which creates a lower leverage ratio and results in a much better credit rating that helps to keep its future debt (and capital costs) low. This helps to keep margins strong and the dividend highly secure.That's not to say that FedEx's debt levels are yet at dangerous levels. After all, its interest coverage ratio remains fantastic, and its debt/capital and current ratios are better than industry average.Investors just need to be aware that with rates now likely to rise for several years, the days of FedEx being able to fund its aggressive growth plans with ultra cheap debt are likely at an end.Dividend Profile: FedEx's Superior Growth Prospects Remain IntriguingSources: Gurufocus, Fastgraphs, FactSet Research, Multpl.com, Moneychimp.comDividend growth investing is not just about yield, but also about dividend security and long-term growth prospects. After all, studies show that a good long-term rule of thumb for total returns is yield + dividend growth.From that perspective, while UPS offers the vastly superior yield, FedEx likely is the better dividend growth stock, owing both to its lower FCF payout (which is temporarily elevated) and faster long-term growth trajectory.Of course, that's only true if FedEx management can execute well on its long-term cost-cutting goals, in order to achieve the kind of EPS and FCF/share growth that will allow it to hopefully grow the dividend at double UPS's rate for many years to come.Valuation: No Contest, UPS Is The Better Buy TodaySource: GurufocusWhile FedEx's long-term growth prospects are indeed better than those of its rival (at least theoretically), that superior growth is very much priced into the stock. As you can see, while UPS is trading at pretty much its historic PE and yield, from a PE perspective, FedEx looks very much overvalued.Of course, the true intrinsic value of a stock is based not on the past, but on future earnings discounted to the present. So let's run a discounted cash flow analysis and see what that tells us.Sources: Morningstar, Fastgraphs, GurufocusJust remember that a DCF analysis is far from perfect, as it requires us to extrapolate growth far into the future (in this case 20 years). However, when doing so, we can see that FedEx actually appears to be trading at fair value, while UPS is the one that is a bit richly priced.Of course, this conclusion is only true if management can hit its long-term guidance because FedEx shares are currently pricing in higher growth than UPS.By using both the backwards-looking and forward-looking methods, we can conclude that both stocks are either at fair value (given a long enough time horizon) or slightly overpriced, at least historically speaking.Of course, both are still expected to beat the market in the long term, so opening a position in either is an OK idea, despite neither company appearing cheap.Just be aware that both stocks are set up for a potentially aggressive pullback, especially given that the stock market is now overdue for a general correction. That means that those looking to add to their positions should probably wait for a 15% to 25% pullback that is likely to occur during the market's next correction.Risks To ConsiderBoth UPS and FedEx are deeply exposed to US and global economic growth. In other words, these are not recession-resistant businesses (though the dividend is likely safe during a downturn).In addition, increasing exposure to foreign shipping means that a strong US dollar, now the strongest in 15 years, could mean additional tailwinds for both companies. This is especially true for FedEx, however, given its smaller size and recent acquisition of TNT, whose successful integration and growth is a key catalyst for the company to expand its sales and margins in the long term.As long as US economic growth remains superior to that of other major markets such as Britain, the EU, China, and Japan, US interest rates are likely to continue climbing. That would increase demand for the dollar and only make it harder for both companies to achieve their growth objectives.Additional risks, especially for FedEx, whose employees are mostly contractors, is the risk of unionization, which would raise operating costs and only further harm its already struggling margins.UPS already has a highly unionized labor force and has managed to capture sufficient operational efficiencies to counter the higher employee compensation costs.Finally, we can't forget the threat from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is aggressively investing in its own delivery systems. While this may not be an existential threat to either company, it is potentially a larger risk to their EPS and FCF growth efforts.After all, both UPS and FedEx are investing aggressively in ground transport to take advantage of the rise of e-commerce. With Amazon representing 50% of all growth in online deliveries, Jeff Bezos deciding to take delivery in-house, even for just a fraction of the company's delivery needs, could spell big margin trouble for both companies, but especially FedEx, whose much lower margins can't afford to contract as much without threatening the dividend growth thesis.Bottom Line: Both Great Dividend Growth Stocks, But FedEx Has A Lot To Prove, ESPECIALLY At Today's ValuationDon't get me wrong, I think that both FedEx and UPS are great long-term dividend growth stocks, which is why I own both in my own diversified income growth portfolio.That being said, with its superior margins and returns on capital, stronger balance sheet, and higher yield, UPS is clearly the better company at a fundamental level.And while neither of these delivery giants is cheap right now, UPS's share price, trading at fair value, is far more justifiable than that of its rival.While I expect FedEx to do great in the future, especially when it comes to boosting operational efficiencies and profitability, at the current valuation, management has a lot to prove. That is why I recommend that investors wanting to own a piece of FedEx wait for a better time before opening a position, much less add to an existing one.Special Online Event Coming Soon!!!Brian Bain From Investor In The Family Radio and Seeking Alpha are joining forces to present an online DIY Investing Summit at the end of January.

4032209,33291,2016-12-22T10:36:07-05:00,FedEx ran into an unexpected hiccup in its most recent quarter.I discuss performance and elaborate on what happened.Year of TNT Express integration costs may weigh.,"When FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) pulled back heavily in June I noted this as a buying opportunity. It is important to note that when I first opined on the name, I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. I also thought it should raise its dividend, and of course it did recently raise the payout 60%. The company had been firing on all cylinders, but today some are saying this name is about to crash and burn. That it should be sold and avoided. Being a realist, I think it is appropriate to say FedEx ran into an unexpected hiccup.What do I mean? Well the company has just reported another quarter of earning but this time it had issues. It wasn't all doom and gloom as the action suggested, as did the headlines. So how weak was it? Well, revenue was $14.9 billion, rising 19.2% year-over-year and meeting estimates. That is a positive. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $2.59 for the first quarter compared to $2.44 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income rose slight year-over-year to $1.23 billion. Adjusted earnings were $2.80 per share, rising from $2.58 last year. However, this missed estimates by $0.10.Part of the reason the company saw a large increase on a per-share basis was due to buybacks, which I will discuss, but the company has also been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from these profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense, and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year, helping to improve results. That said, operating margin was pressured and came in at 8.3%, down from 9.6% last year.Segment-specific results were also impressive for the most part. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.60 billion, up 3% from last year's $1.55 billion. However, due to lower average weight per packages and some I.T. costs, operating income was pressured. It fell 13% to $88 million, down from the $101 million a year ago. Of course, operating margin was also pressured, coming in at 5.5%, down from the from the 6.5% last year. These results weighed on overall performance.Turning to the Ground segment, revenues increased markedly, coming in at $4.42 billion, up 9% from last year's $4.05 billion. Thanks to higher rent costs, transportation rates and network expansion, expenses rose pressuring operating income. Operating income fell 12% to $465 million, from $526 million a year ago. Margins of course took a hit as one might guess from the drop in operating income. Operating margin was 10.5%, down from 14.0% the previous year.The Express segment was up year-over-year on a revenue, operating income and margins basis. Revenue was $6.74 billion, up from last year's $6.59 billion. However thanks to strong expense management as well as fuel and currency exchange positive impacts, operating income rose to $654 million from $622 million a year ago. Further, operating margin jumped to 9.7%, up from 9.4% last year. I will also point out that the TNT Express segment brought in revenues of $1.9 billion and operating income of $90 million.The rise in expenses really weighed this quarter. In terms of deliveries, for the most part I felt the quarter was strong based on the results. Revenues were up sharply as a whole. But the expenses led to a huge hit to margins and as such weighed on earnings, explaining the miss on estimates. These results are strong. It is important to note that the company expects to incur significant expenses over the next few years in connection with our integration of TNT Express and the Outlook restructuring program. Looking ahead to 2017, FedEx expects moderate economic growth but hinted a precise estimate of sales and earnings is tough. That said the company set its adjusted earnings forecast to $11.85 to $12.35 per share with capital spending of $5.1 billion (this is a $0.10 hike to guidance on both ends). Bottom line, don't let one quarter scare you. If you have profits, by all means take some. But I would stick by the name through the holiday shopping season.Note from the author: Christopher F.

4032408,31441,2016-12-23T08:16:44-05:00,"FDX reported quarterly earnings earlier this week.Organic revenue growth was 5%, and EBITDA margins slid.Rising rates could slow the global economy and FDX's top-line growth.I do not see much upside in the stock. Avoid FDX.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported quarterly earnings earlier this week. Revenue of $14.9 billion was in line, but the company missed on EPS by $0.10. FDX fell over 3% after the earnings miss. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.Paltry Organic GrowthFedEx reported another quarter of robust revenue growth. Total revenue rose 20% Y/Y. The biggest gainer was FedEx Ground, which grew 9%; the other segments all experienced low-single-digit revenue growth.The company benefited from the inclusion of TNT Express; the European road network was acquired in May and generated $1.9 billion in revenue this quarter. Sans TNT, the company's organic growth would have been 5%. FDX is up 35% this year versus a 13% rise in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). However, I do not believe single-digit organic sales growth justifies the performance of the stock.Declining EBITDA MarginsEBITDA margins were 13% during the quarter, down from 14% in the year earlier period. Salaries and transportation costs were a combined 60% of revenue this quarter, up from 48% in the year earlier period. The company is still integrating the acquisitions of GENCO (made in March 2015) and TNT Express. FedEx expects integration costs to peak next year; after that, margins should expand. If margins do not improve, then it could eventually become a cause for concern. FedEx would have added scale through acquisitions, yet the benefits of that scale - improving margins - would have eluded the company.Cyclical names like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) have executed cost containment programs amid stagnant revenue. FedEx might have to follow suit by the second half of next year in order to please investors.Is The Economy FedEx's Friend?Growth in business-to-business traffic and express mail are largely correlated with the growth in the economy. The company expects 2017 to be another year of moderate GDP growth:Regardless of what happens next year, I am not bullish on the long-term growth of the economy or FedEx's prospects. Rising rates could choke off the sale of big ticket items like houses and autos that drive the economy. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a small segment of society also does not bode well for consumer spending. Lastly, president-elect Donald Trump's infrastructure spending might not kick in until the second half of 2017. In between, the country faces rising rates and not fiscal stimulus.ConclusionFedEx did not deliver in its most recent quarter. Given stagnant organic growth and sliding margins, I do not see any upside in the stock. A P/E ratio of 29x is not justified by the company's growth prospects. Avoid FDX."

That would not make for a bad year at all.Here are their other 4 predictions:1. S&P 500 adjusted EPS will break out to at least $127/share. This follows two years of non-growth in EPS, and will be fueled by revenue expansion that will ""more than offset rising wage pressure.""2.

(NYSE:FDX) posted a horrible quarter. Though one needs to understand that the package delivery company has a history of randomly missing estimates and the inclusion of results from TNT Express probably alters the numbers from expectations.The stock recently touched $200 so the investment thesis is greatly altered from the summer when FedEx briefly traded below $150. The question now is whether the stock is worth owning after the big rally and only a $5 pullback today.FedEx posted a huge quarterly miss of $0.10. A good point for investors to understand is that the company has historically missed estimates at least once per year according to the Seeking Alpha earnings page.A key understanding for investors is that a huge difference exists between analyst estimates and actual growth numbers. FedEx has a history of growing earnings while not keeping analyst estimates in line. The guidance for FY17 remains a mid point of $12.10 that is slightly below analyst estimates of $12.16 though the number suggests only a small issue from FQ2.Going back to the original investment thesis from the summer, FedEx has soared from those levels similar to the market. Comparing the stock to Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and UPS (NYSE:UPS) again, the stock remains cheap but the valuation multiple has soared in the last six months.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIronically, Union Pacific and UPS have soared in unison. FedEx remains cheap in comparison to those transport stocks. Though the stock doesn't offer the same value as back in June.The key investor takeaway is that the recent stock gains make FedEx less appealing to own. The package delivery company faces competitive threats from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the reality that 16x forward earnings estimates is likely expensive. One can't really expect FedEx to trade at similar irrational multiples as UPS when the company annually misses analyst estimates."

Having acquired TNT Express this year, FedEx strengthened its market position and invigorated its investors. Below, I will elaborate why you should hold shares of FedEx after their 29% rally since the start of 2016 (see Picture 1). For this purpose, I will analyze the company's financial position, and then I will estimate the target price of its shares.Picture 1.Source: Yahoo FinanceFinancial Position AnalysisBased on information from Picture 2, we can observe the following:Picture 2.Sources: FedEx Q2 2017 Report, MorningstarTrading Comparables AnalysisOn Picture 3, you can see multiples comparison of FedEx with the industry average. Both EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples imply that FedEx is fairly valued.Picture 3.Sources: FedEx Financial Reports, Morningstar, DamodaranDCF AnalysisTaking into account the latest quarterly results, I expect the company's 2017 sales to be higher by c. $9bn than the year before. Most of the increase will be attributable to the consolidated financials of TNT Express. Having acquired its competitor, FedEx complemented its already existing air delivery service in Europe with ground delivery. I believe that the company's strengthened position in the Express segment, together with solid performance in the Ground segment, justifies my assumption of mid-single-digit growth rates of sales until 2020.Also, I factor in a 10% operating margin since 2019 onwards in accordance with management's guidance in October investor presentation. Although current margin is lower, there are two reasons that might explain the expected increase. First, according to management, acquisition of TNT Express is estimated to bring $750m of synergies annually by the end of 2020. Second, profitability of TNT Express will increase (current operating margin is close to zero) since the company is undergoing a restructuring process.The results of my DCF model are presented in Picture 4. The valuation date is the 1st of January 2017. For that reason I include a 5/12 stub of 2017 financials for the first projection year. All the assumptions that I made in my analysis are footnoted in the Excel file.My model results in FedEx's Enterprise Value of $68.2bn. After accounting for net debt and after-tax pension provisions, I derive the equity value of $53.6bn that implies an intrinsic share price of $201. With FedEx's shares currently trading at $191.9, the stock is overvalued by 5%.Picture 4.Sources: FedEx Annual Report 2016, Morningstar, Model created by authorYou can see the sensitivity table on Picture 5.

However, for investors willing to own American Depository Receipts, ADRs, a stake in Deutsche Post (Deutsche Post DHL Group) (OTCPK:DPSGY) is also worth consideration. DHL Group is a global leader outside of the U.S., a geography that both FedEx and UPS have aggressively attempted to gain market share in.In addition to these global carriers, both Atlas Air Worldwide (NASDAQ:AAWW) and Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ:ATSG) provide airfreighter cargo planes on lease for their customers. Notably, DHL Group has been a core customer for both companies, but recently Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has entered into lease agreements, as the company has looked to reduce its transportation costs.Yahoo! FinanceDuring 2016, all companies have witnessed robust stock price performance, greater than the S&P 500 index. Only Air Transport Group and FedEx have outperformed the SPDR S&P Transportation index. Air Transport Group has returned an astounding 64 percent through early December, while FedEx has returned nearly 33 percent.The laggard of this group has been DHL Group with an 18 percent return to date, while both Atlas Air Worldwide and UPS have returned at or above 25 percent. The interesting factor has been the recent quarterly results for both Air Transport Group and Atlas Air Worldwide. The former missed earnings estimates but beat revenue estimates, while Atlas Air Worldwide missed both. Atlas Air Worldwide seemed to ride Air Transport Group's coattails, and the Trump-infused rally bolstered them higher like all other transports.Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Economic ResearchLarger peers including FedEx, UPS and DHL Group tend to focus on gross domestic product, GDP as a major benchmark for their businesses. For DHL Group, global GDP is often relied upon as the company has exposure to every major continent.For FedEx and UPS, U.S. GDP is a core indicator for each company's business prospects. Over the previous five years, GDP has continued to remain positive with a couple of exceptions. All major carriers have strong exposure to both customer and residential shipments. The majority of shipments has traditionally been tied to businesses, thus the relationship to GDP.However, e-commerce has continued to grow at a substantially faster rate than traditional retail. The addition of quicker delivery times with orders being fulfilled within days or even the same day in some cases, has greatly expanded the parcel delivery reach into every-day neighborhoods.But major carriers like FedEx, UPS and DHL Group are not only air freight and package delivery companies. FedEx and UPS have strong less-than-truckload, LTL operations; FedEx being the largest by tonnage and revenue in North America. DHL Group has one of the largest global supply chain operations in the world including air and ocean freight forwarding. FedEx and UPS have also ventured further into asset light services in addition to air freight forwarding and other logistics and distribution services.Both FedEx and UPS' top strategic goals are focused on e-commerce and globalization. FedEx's recent acquisition of TNT Express, at UPS's failed attempt, is a clear indication of the competitive factors driving growth. TNT Express fits both categories as it will benefit from continued e-commerce growth, and has furthered FedEx's market share within Europe.Source: Company financials and personal data baseMany of the fundamentals for these companies were ripe for expansion. For instance, both the P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios were severely discounted earlier during the year. As operating revenues have increased for most companies, profitability margins have remained stable leading to greater diluted earnings per share, EPS, growth.DHL Group has been more of a cost cutting story as management has been able to substantially drive improved EBIT meeting targets, both for this year and last year. Atlas Air Worldwide has witnessed reduced operating revenues and diluted EPS on an adjusted basis, but expectations are for revenues to pick up next year bringing a return to earnings growth.Most companies are levered between 1.5 and 2.3 times EBITDA, with Atlas Air Worldwide as the exception at 5.5 times. Debt to capital levels were consistent with the majority between 50 and 60 percent. FedEx and UPS commanded the highest EV/EBITDA premiums versus the group which is arguably justified based on scale and product mix. Free cash flow yields were stable for the major carriers, but negative for lessors. DHL Group and UPS were the primary dividend-friendly companies of the group.Source: Company financials and personal data baseDomestic package revenue has been stable for both the U.S. and Europe as evidenced by operating revenue growth for the three major carriers. Both FedEx and UPS provide further granularity for both package shipments and revenue yields driving revenue results.For FedEx, shipment growth has lagged UPS, but yields have been stronger. The stronger yield has resulted from FedEx's deferred product yield increase at 4 percent through the year. The increase in yield has resulted in a decline in shipments at just below 4 percent, but the substantially larger number of overnight box and envelope shipments have offset this decline with growth near 4 percent a piece.For UPS, both next day air and deferred products witnessed increased shipments by five and three percent, respectively. Yields for next day air declined by 2.5 percent, while deferred yields improved by 2 percent; over 50 percent of shipments were from next day air products.Source: Company financials and personal data baseGround package delivery has been a cornerstone service for UPS as the ""brown"" delivery trucks are recognized across the U.S. The phrase, ""what can brown do for you?"" surely resonates in many thoughts from marketing campaigns.Nonetheless, FedEx has made strong inroads into this key market. Across the Atlantic, DHL Group has also witnessed robust growth for its Europe eCommerce segment. The strength of e-commerce is clearly evidenced in both the U.S. and Europe by the peer operating revenue performance above.FedEx and DHL Group have both witnessed double-digit operating revenue and shipment growth, while at the same time, achieving positive yield performance. For UPS, growth has occurred, but it has been much more muted. As the clear market leader, a slower pace of growth is to be expected. Operating revenues and shipments were 1.5 and 1.6 times that of FedEx through September 2016.Similar to Amazon's foray into leasing airfreighter cargo planes, the company has ventured into relying upon other transportation providers for its last-mile deliveries. Amazon will likely continue to pursue strategies outside of FedEx and UPS's business services, but it will be at a gradual pace, and it may only evolve into a capacity loss tied only to Amazon.Source: Company financials and personal data baseInternational package performance has been mixed between peers with UPS and DHL Group performing better overall versus FedEx. For FedEx, international priority and economy shipments have been flat, while international domestic shipments were up over 3 percent. Sixty percent of international shipments were domestic.International priority and economy yields were down nearly 3 percent and international domestic yields were down greater than 7.5 percent. Clearly, the international domestic segment has weighed on FedEx's business.For UPS, both international domestic and export shipments were up nearly 3 and 4 percent, respectively. International domestic shipments similar as FedEx reflected nearly 58 percent of the combined total. Combined international yields were at nearly 2 percent. To date, UPS has benefited from both stronger international domestic shipment growth and yield performance than FedEx.Source: Company financials and personal data baseAtlas Air Worldwide and Air Transport Group both are not comparable for carrier shipments, aside from providing airfreighter capacity to move goods. Neither company is directly comparable to non-LTL operating revenues including air freight, freight forwarding, customs and truck brokerage and supply chain, and logistics and distribution services.However, both companies are included in this section as their operating revenues will be driven by the continued growth in e-commerce and GDP growth. There really is no direct comparison in the above table aside from the air freight lessors. Atlas Air Worldwide clearly has the lead over Air Transport Group for operating revenues, but the latter has achieved much stronger performance of late. Many have been focused on the additional capacity for Amazon, but airfreighter leases to DHL Group, Amerijet, Raya Airways and the company's European affiliate West Atlantic have all contributed.DHL Group is a behemoth for its global supply chain operations. The company's air freight segment by tonnage is 2.4 times that of FedEx. FedEx has continued to successfully orchestrate a leading express service structure that typically provides the company to attain higher yields versus its peers. Many competitors have looked to increase their deferred product services as a strategy due to FedEx's strong competitive market.When it comes to freight forwarding, brokerage services and other logistics and distribution services, UPS finds itself ahead of FedEx. The recent acquisition of Coyote Logistics is an example of UPS's focus on growing its competitive edge, as well as diversifying its cross-selling service opportunities.Source: Company financials and personal data baseBoth air freight lessors have struggled from a diluted EPS standpoint. Expectations are for improved performance next year as operating revenues continue to increase from airfreighter leased capacity. Clearly, DHL Group and FedEx have outperformed their peers, while UPS's performance has been solid.The theme for these companies is again, the expectations for the combination of revenue growth and sustained margins as drivers for improved diluted EPS performance. U.S. GDP will possibly be higher during the first half of 2017 as 2016's base was low. Overall, expectations will likely be between 2 and 3 percent for the year. This type of GDP growth will be able to sustain expected continued revenue and earnings performance, albeit at varying levels, and depending upon global GDP performance.Overall, investors with stakes in any of these companies have had a banner year. I would be cautious if I were looking to take a position in any one of these companies at today's prices. Like all other transport industries, many companies are trading at fair value or slight premiums. Being patient and waiting for a pull-back is suggested.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Analysts expect the company to deliver revenue of $14.92 billion and EPS of $2.90. The revenue estimate implies growth of 1.7% Q/Q. Investors should focus on the following key items:Organic GrowthGlobal expansion since the Financial Crisis is getting long in the tooth and I expect revenue growth for cyclical names like FedEx to slow. Top line growth for railroads have declined and railcars have free fallen. However, FedEx has defied the odds.Revenue for the quarter ended August 2016 was up 19% Y/Y. FedEx benefited from the inclusion of TNT Express which the company acquired in May. The European road network added $1.8 billion in revenue last quarter; sans TNT, FedEx's organic growth would have been 5% - nothing to write home about. FedEx Express - the company's bread and butter - was flat at 1%. FedEx Ground is now the growth driver with 12% growth. Going forward, the company might realize the most competition in this area from the likes of UPS (NYSE:UPS) and others if the economy ever slows.Stagnant MarginsEBITDA margins were 14% last quarter versus 15% in the year earlier period. Once the company fully integrates TNT, it could find efficiencies in certain areas. However, fuel costs declined to 4% of revenue from 6% in the year earlier period. This decline had nothing to do with management talent and its reversal will not portend management frailties. Oil prices have risen above $55 on an OPEC supply cut and FedEx's fuel prices should rise with it.Of note is that transportation costs rose to 22% of revenue from 19% in the year earlier period. The company's biggest cost items are salaries and purchased transportation. Look for management to take a scalpel to these areas in order to maintain margins.ConclusionI expect weak organic growth and steady margins. Guidance will be key as the rising dollar could slow top line growth going forward."

4010892,25228,2016-10-07T16:10:24-04:00,"FedEx as a total return security offers some appeal.However, many investors often look over this company as a result of the low starting yield.This article demonstrates how you can both own shares and slightly or materially increase your cash flow.","If you wanted to put together an investment thesis for Tennessee-based package delivery firm FedEx (NYSE:FDX) it might be easier than it first appears. Should you glance at the typical financial website, you would see earnings per share in the $6 to $7 range and consequently a P/E ratio north of 25; that doesn't look like a good start for such a well-established firm.Yet this does not necessarily reflect the underlying earnings power that FedEx is capable of producing. For fiscal year 2016 FedEx reported GAAP earnings of $6.51. However, this included mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments of over $3 per share. FedEx indicated that its adjusted earnings per share were $10.80. Indeed, for next year adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $11.75-$12.25 range.On this basis, you're suddenly looking at a successful firm trading hands at 14 to 16 times adjusted earnings, depending on if you're looking at it from a trailing or forward basis.Over the intermediate-term, analysts are presently anticipating rather solid growth from the company - north of 10%. This could come to fruition, but it's a good deal faster than the company's prior history (over the past decade revenues have grown by 4.5% per annum, company-wide earnings by 5% per year and earnings per share at an average rate of about 6%.) Still, an expectation of say 7% annual growth could turn in fine investment results.When coupled with an increasing dividend, today's investors could easily be looking at 7% to 10% annual investment return expectations, with an added boost should the forecast growth actually come about.The sticking point for a lot of investors is the current dividend. The growth in this payout has been tremendous: a 60% this year, a 25% boost the year before, a 33% raise in 2014 and so on. Yet the current $0.40 quarterly dividend still only represents a yield of slightly less than 1%.To be sure, not everyone shares the goal of cash flow generation - instead looking for total returns. Yet, it remains that dividends can help on the passive side (i.e. not having to decide when to sell.) And, in my view, it adds a bit of stability - whether actual or psychological - in the way of collecting a quarterly paycheck regardless of the price others may or may not be willing to pay for your stake at a given moment in time.A lot of investors may see the yield and think, ""what's next?"" Of course, this doesn't have to be an ""either or"" process. You don't necessarily have to choose between owning shares and settling for a lower yield or not owning shares and looking for a higher-yielding opportunity elsewhere. You can both own shares of FedEx and slightly or dramatically increase the amount of cash flow that you receive.To accomplish this you can look at some available call options - agreements to potentially sell you stake. I'll walk through an illustration to get a better feel for what I mean.The above table shows various call options available for FedEx for the January 2018 expiration date. It should be noted that I have no affinity for this expiration date (and indeed, it's a rather long time: ~15 months). However, it gives you a concept of the types of agreements that are out there. The point is not to recommend a certain agreement (or one at all), but instead it's about exploring what is available.The first column shows the strike price, or the price at which you would be agreeing to sell at least 100 shares of FedEx. Incidentally, this by itself brings up a potential roadblock. As options trade in round lots, the minimum required investment for this strategy, should it strike your interest (and thinking in ""covered"" terms) is north of $17,000. Still, it's just as much about the process as it is with this particular security.The ""net"" premium column takes the most recent bid less $0.15 per share for frictional expenses. The premium yield column details the yield that this would represent based on a share price near $173 as I write this. The final column shows your ""maximum"" gain should the call be exercised, but not including any dividends received along the way.Let's look at two examples to get a better feel for the agreements. Perchance you're happy to hold shares of FedEx (especially at a lower price) but you would also like to generate a substantial cash flow from the holding. In this case, you could sell the $175 call as an example.In doing so, you would receive ~$1,670 upfront for making that agreement to potentially sell your shares at a per share price of $175 anytime between now and January of 2018. Let's look at the two basic outcomes: either the option is exercised or it is not.If the option is not exercised, you continue to hold your shares in FedEx and you continue to collect dividends along the way. The only difference between you and the buy-and-hold investor in this scenario is the ""extra"" ~$1,600 that you received upfront. Granted this could be taxed at a different rate than qualified dividends, but obviously this is a fine result should you be happy to hold regardless - a 10%+ cash flow yield (including dividends) for this arrangement.On the other hand, the option could be exercised. In this case, you would still have your ~$1,670 in upfront option proceeds to go along with $17,500 (less fees) in sale proceeds. Your total return would be in the 11% to 12% range depending on how many dividend payments are collected along the way. This too is a reasonable result.Of course, the risk here is that shares jump to say $220 and you're ""stuck"" selling at $175. That's a real risk and ought to be properly considered beforehand. One way to do so is to look at higher strike prices - giving up current income now for the potential of realizing greater capital appreciation later.So, to continue the example, instead of agreeing to sell at $175 you could think about agreeing to sell at say $220. In this case, your upfront cash flow would be far less: ""only"" ~$280 or so. Yet this still could be a fine arrangement depending on your goals.If the option is not exercised, you have an ""extra"" $280 that the buy-and-hold investor does not have. Alternatively, should the option be exercised, you're looking at a 30% total return in a matter of 15 months.In short, I'm not recommending that you make an agreement to potentially sell your stake in FedEx or any company for that matter. That's a largely personal decision, and ought to reflect your underlying investment goals. However, what I am advocating is to at least be aware of your options - in this case literally.All too many investors fixate on a specific starting dividend yield, when really the cash flow terms are a bit more negotiable; a bit more fluid than that. When you see that FedEx has a yield of less than 1%, that doesn't mean that you have to automatically pass. As demonstrated above, the potential cash flow could easily be 2% or 5% or even 10% depending on if any of the agreements strike you as fair."
4031513,102587,2016-12-19T16:15:41-05:00,"54.55% of global delivery service market share is determined by small competitors; FDX continues to grow its global footprint through strategic acquisitions such as TNT Express.FDX faces positive industry momentum with an average projected global revenue growth of 3.5% over the next five years.FDX is a value buy with an average target value of $232.56, 18.65% above its current market price.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) bolsters itself as the world's largest express delivery service provider at a time where time-sensitive delivery has become increasingly important domestically and internationally. As globalization expands, e-commerce spending increases, and smaller players get forced out, FDX has become a lucrative buy opportunity.I've split up my recommendation on FDX into five sections: Historical Analysis, Macroeconomic Outlook, Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Multiples Analysis, and a Final Buy/Sell Pitch.Historical AnalysisWhen looking at FDX, there are three key components of its historical performance to consider: A) Its Revenue Growth, B) Its Operating Profit Margin, and C) Its Return on Invested Capital.In terms of Revenue Growth, FDX has grown 6.14% from FYE 15 - FYE 16. FDX's top line bolstered a $50.365 Billion jump over its prior year of $47.453 Billion. On average, FDX has revenue growth of 5.10% over the past six years. Comparatively, over the past 5 fiscal years UPS has averaged a growth rate of just 2.40% around half that of FDX's. Additionally, FDX's US Market Share Growth has grown 3.5% in the past year compared to a smaller 1.17% growth of its biggest competitor, UPS.On top of its strong top line, FDX increased its operating profit margin by 55% from FY 15 to FY 16 from 3.93% to 6.11%. FDX's increased operating profit is coupled with a healthy 70% jump in Net Operating Profit After Tax as its effective tax rate concurrently dropped from 35.46% to 33.58%.FDX's Return on Invested Capital grew at a rate of 30% from FY 15 to FY 16 from 6.11% to 7.96%. On average, FDX's ROIC growth equals 11.26% from FY 11 to FY 16. This means that as FDX continues to pour capital into its growing company it continues to grow its profits concurrently.Macro-OutlookThere are two main components when considering the macroeconomic outlook for Couriers & Local Delivery Services: Increased demand for express delivery and increased globalization.According to the IBISWorld Global Couriers & Local Delivery Services report, express delivery continues to become increasingly popular. Demand for express services is driven by global internet usage and consumer spending growth, which promotes online shopping and the need for goods to be efficiently moved from buyer to seller. As time sensitive delivery becomes increasingly popular, FDX remains the world's largest express delivery company. FDX acquired Bongo International in 2014 in order to offer small business clients e-commerce delivery needs. The company also recently renewed an air transport contract with USPS Express Mail and international delivery of USPS Priority Mail. This seven-year contract is valued at $10.5 Billion was locked in as of 2013 and has been considered a major strength in the express competitive landscape domestically and internationally.As emerging economies strengthen and developed economies become more interconnected, Couriers & Local Delivery Services benefit from global connectivity. As industry revenues grow and economies of scale benefit key competitors, 54.5% of market share remains determined by smaller competitors. Global revenues in delivery services are expected to grow at a 5-year annualized rate of 3.5%. With strong projected expansions, the competitive landscape will become more competitive pushing smaller players out. International operations require significant capital and benefit from bargaining power. Smaller firms lack brand recognition and are frequently positioned as price takers. Existing major players will use economies of scale to win business by consistently undercutting smaller players on price and delivery speed. FDX is continually investing in its global footprint through its recent acquisition of the European firm TNT Express; UPS was prohibited from acquiring TNT Express in 2012. FDX was able to acquire TNT in 2016, which increased ground delivery networks throughout Europe and further international connectivity. This acquisition is projected to transform combined earnings from dilutive to accretive by 2018.Discounted Cash Flow Valuation**All data is projected from latest FYE-16 10KUnder a DCF valuation I created mapping out 5 years of free cash flows, the current stock price of FDX is currently undervalued by 33.31% (as of 12/18/16). FDX's firm free cash flows are projected to increase as increased industry revenues climb, gains from recent acquisitions like TNT Express are realized, and large investments in PPE are stabilized. The valuation was based on a 1.08 re-levered Beta, a risk free rate of 2.6% (10-year treasury yield), a 5.5% market premium, and an approximately ~5% Weighted Average Cost of Capital.The NPV of CFs yielded $17.67 Billion for the planning period and an NPV of $62.03 Billion for the Present value of the Terminal Period. Thus, the equity value with debt deducted and non-operating assets added back was $69.38 Billion, which resulted in a stock price of $261.28, well above its current price.EV/ EBITDA ValuationIn taking another valuation approach, I measured FDX's equity value to UPS's EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.29. Using an EV / EBITDA, I could project a less volatile outlook on the firm's long term cash flow generation. This multiple yielded a lower estimate of FDX's equity value, but still projected a current market undervaluation. The EV/EBITDA valuation projects an equity value for FDX of $54.12 Billion, with a stock price $203.84. This valuation is 4% higher than the current stock price of $196.48.RecommendationI recommend a Buy Rating for FDX at a target price of $232.56. This target price is derived as an average between the two valuation methods above and stands as 18.65% above its current market price. Outside of the fundamental valuation of FDX, external factors play to FDX's benefit. As stated earlier, 54.55% of delivery service operators remain small businesses; with an increase in consumer spending and online shopping, customers expect reliability, speed, and effectiveness. These traits are exemplified in FDX's dedication to its express delivery platform and its global outlook. FDX will continue to push out smaller players and expand its global footprint in a time with positive industry momentum, increased globalization, and opportunities for additional long-term contracts with online retailers. Ultimately, FDX provides steady cash flows, reliable service, a strong market presence, and retains a positive brand image that it will continue to take advantage of going into the near future. FDX provides a safe investment with projected results that few companies offer in today's economic environment.Appendix1.

4006944,65113,2016-09-19T02:41:17-04:00,"FedEx (FDX) has shown below average growth in earnings and free cash flow.
        While capital expenditure for the TNT acquisition has no doubt played a part in this, the outcome on the overall business model is uncertain.
        While FedEx continues to maintain a strong brand, I would wait for an uptick in earnings and free cash flow growth before jumping in.","MY CURRENT RATING: HOLDFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a leading competitor in the air cargo industry. It is a brand renowned for quality and excellence, and market reception for the stock has been broadly positive of late. However, as a stock, does FedEx have the right blend of growth and income potential necessary to make a profitable investment?From an industry standpoint, FedEx is argued to be in a great position to grow over the next few years as online sales transactions continue to increase and demand for cargo services has been rising as a result.However, the dividend payout for this company stands at 1.01% at the time of writing, which is lower than the services average of 2.39%. The argument for this is that the company continues to reinvest cash flow into the business, and as such is a necessary tradeoff for higher growth over the long term.When we take a look at the firm's free cash flow metrics, we see that free cash flow per share has not been showing significant growth on a five-year basis, while the firm's price to free cash flow has been trading at just under 50, which is still significantly higher than the average level seen from 2012-2014:Moreover, while we have seen EPS (diluted) rising in 2016 along with the PE ratio falling to a level of 24.44, the valuation is still trading at an overall premium in the context of a five-year timeline:In this regard, my impression is that while a low dividend rate could be acceptable if the company was showing clear signs of growth in earnings and free cash flow, we have not been doing so.While at a price of $158 the stock is trading below the peaks seen in 2015, I do not see the current rates of growth in earnings and free cash flow as justifying an undervaluation for the company.It could well be that the opposite proves to be the case - the company has no doubt had to sacrifice cash for capital spending as part of acquiring TNT. In this regard, earnings performance for September 20 is expected to be positive, with $2.81 expected to be the consensus analyst estimate for this quarter - an increase over the $2.42 recorded for the same quarter last year.Ultimately, FedEx is in a bit of an uncertain spot right now due to the complex task of integrating TNT into its overall operations, as well as possible ramifications of Brexit for the company's operations. In this regard, while there is not enough of a case to warrant a sell on this company outright - I would only be inclined to jump in when and if we see more defined growth in earnings and free cash flow."
4007612,33291,2016-09-21T12:45:33-04:00,"When FedEx pulled back in June, I called it a buying opportunity.Fiscal Q1 earnings are out, and they have surprised once again.With expected price hikes and a recent acquisition, the company is firing on all cylinders.","FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) pulled back in June, and I noted this as a buying opportunity. It is important to note that when I first opined on the name, I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. I also thought it should raise its dividend, and of course it did recently raise 60%. Today the stock seems primed to make a run higher, and that is because once again, the company has delivered.The company has just reported another strong quarter. So how good are we talking? Well, revenue was $14.7 billion, rising 19.7% year-over-year and beating estimates by $890 million. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $2.65 for the first quarter compared to $2.42 per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and as such adjusted operating income rose 12% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings were $2.90 per share and beat expectations by $0.12.Part of the reason the company delivered on a per-share basis was due to buybacks, which I will discuss, but the company has also been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from these profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense, and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year, helping to improve results. That said, operating margin was pressured and came in at 8.6%, down from 9.3% last year.Segment-specific results were also impressive for the most part. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.66 billion, up 4% from last year's $1.60 billion. Operating income was $135 million, flat from the $132 million a year ago, and operating margin was pressured, coming in at 8.1%, almost flat from the 8.2% last year. Revenue was up thanks to higher average daily shipments.Turning to the Ground segment, revenues increased markedly, coming in at $4.29 billion, up 12% from last year's $3.83 billion. Operating income was up as well to $610 million, from $537 million a year ago, increasing 14%. Margins were up very slightly, as one might guess from the big rise in revenues but moderate rise in operating income. Operating margin was 14.2%, up from 14.0% the previous year. Revenues did rise on higher volume and revenue per package.The Express segment was up year-over-year on a revenue, operating income and margins basis. Revenue was $6.66 billion, up from last year's $6.59 billion. However thanks to strong expense management as well as fuel and currency exchange positive impacts, operating income rose 19% to $646 million from $545 million a year ago. Further, operating margin jumped to 9.4%, up from 8.3% last year.These results are strong. Looking ahead to 2017, FedEx expects moderate economic growth but hinted a precise estimate of sales and earnings is tough. That said the company set its adjusted earnings forecast to $11.85 to $12.35 per share with capital spending of $5.1 billion (this is a $0.10 hike to guidance on both ends). With a buyback and higher dividend, as well as continued strong growth, I like the name long-term. On top of that, the company is set to raise rates for shipping once again and this will only help revenues. I continue to like the name going forward.Note from the author: Christopher F.

4005476,32001,2016-09-11T13:15:25-04:00,"Ground segment revenue has risen from 25% to 33% of total FedEx revenue.The question is, how long before Amazon makes a dent in Ground's revenue and margins?Express margins show the productivity gains in the Express segment.","In the ""asset-lite"" business model world investors have seen unfold in the last 20 - 30 years, thanks to the technology-driven productivity boom that started in the early 1980's - and that is now in full swing with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber (NYSE:UBER), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), etc. - FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has been the exception to the rule. They have evolved their business from FedEx Express, to starting and growing the Ground segment in the early 2000's, to integrating acquisitions like TNT. That gives this transport giant not just global scale, but significant operating leverage.And maybe that becomes a longer-term issue.FedEx made a smart move starting about three years ago and instituted a ""profit improvement plan"" (PIP) that has significantly improved the FedEx Express operating margin.When looking at FedEx's business by segment, here is how the revenue and operating income distribution has evolved over the last 4 years:Source: FedEx earnings reports and 10-Q's""Other"" is left-out which is why revenue doesn't sum to 100%As of late 2013, FedEx Express volumes had been declining for 7 - 8 years, and had become barely positive, and thus FedEx management knew it was inevitable that they had to reduce the fixed costs of the segment and improve returns.FedEx Express margins rose a whopping 230 bp's in Q4 '16.And improve it they did: here is a table of FedEx Corp.'s overall operating margin for the last 7 years:Source: FedEx earnings reports and 10-Q'sPrior to the 2008 Financial/Mortgage/Credit Crisis (pick your moniker), FedEx had only managed to achieve a 10% operating margin once, and that was in 2007, right before the mortgage/financial/credit crisis claimed its victims.FedEx's May, 2017, operating margin was - from what I can tell - a post-2000 record, although my spreadsheet only has the income statement as far back as 2000.Since FDX management instituted the PIP, crude oil has fallen from over $100 per barrel in late 2014 to January '16's low near $27 - $28 per barrel. In addition, FedEx has issued $11 billion in long-term debt to both of which aided substantially in the repurchase of almost 25% of FedEx's market cap or fully-diluted shares outstanding.Since 2013, when earnings per share growth for FedEx was -5%, and management put the PIP plan in place, EPS growth for the transport giant has been 10%, 31% and 20% respectively for fiscal 14 - fiscal '16 while revenue growth has averaged 4% over those same four years.Valuation: within the summer trading range around $160 per share, FedEx looks fairly valued, with a high-end of the valuation range near $180 - $185 and if the stock should drop down to the 2016 lows near $120 it looks to be a screaming buy.Based on Thomson Reuters consensus EPS est's as of 9/10/16Trading at 13(x) expected fiscal 2017 estimates, with an expected 11% growth rate, FDX looks pretty reasonably valued on a P.E or PEG basis.Price to cash-flow is 7(x) but price to free-cash-flow is way elevated. I tend to include acquisitions as ""capex"" on FedEx, and although I didn't include TNT in the capex as of the last year, FDX was still just positive on free-cash-flow (FCF).With a 2% free-cash-flow yield, the transport giant is running pretty thing in terms of free-cash generation, although FCF is nearing $900 million as of 5/16, but that's against a $42 billion market cap.Looking back 5 - 7 years the highest free-cash-flow yield FDX ever seen was 5% by my numbers, which could prevent the stock from ever reaching a fuller valuation.FedEx Corp is expected to report fiscal Q1 '17 earnings on September 20th, 2016, after the closing bell (FDX for years reported before the market open, but switched to after the closing bell).Street consensus is expecting $2.84 in earnings per share (EPS) on $14.6 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 17% and 19% respectively. The TNT acquisition closed in Q4 '16, late May '16 to be exact, so total FDX revenue will be distorted for the next fiscal year.When my fiscal Q3 '16 earnings preview was written, the stock was trading around where it is today, but one significant worry longer-term is the continued encroachment of Amazon on the ""last mile"" of the customer business.When the fiscal Q3 '16 earnings preview was written, a substantial part of the preview was wondering what it would mean for FedEx given Amazon's entry into freight, speculation that Fred Smith labeled ""fantastical"" in his 3rd quarter comments, but as of September, 2016, I still see a lot of white Amazon trucks driving around the north side of Chicago delivering whatever it is they are delivering.Another Seeking Alpha contributor wondered the same just recently.Amazon by their nature is a ""disruptor"", whether it is the Cloud or 2/3rd's of the US GDP that represents ""consumption"".Amazon is the largest Cloud company with a sizable lead over Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and the business sprang out of the need for servers and server farms to run the retail business.It sounds crazy, but given the number of US households Amazon sees demand from, what if they said ""we can do this better, faster and cheaper"" vertically integrating the Amazon retail business by becoming a fully-integrated freight economy?The other aspect to the ""Amazon factor"" as we could call it is that, it seems as if the truck delivery service that is FedEx and UPS (NYSE:UPS) has been competition that is ""oligopolistic"" in nature since the late 1990's, early 2000's. DHL seemingly abandoned their parcel delivery service, so is Amazon trying to fill the void? FedEx and UPS have always been able to raise their rates or ""yields"" enough to insure decent returns in the Ground market.Here are two articles, just from Seeking Alpha on this topic, recently.With Amazon/Uber and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), not to mention others looking to get into the same-day or two-hour delivery service, and Amazon having a good head start based on what i see at the local grocery stores, is this somehow a longer-term threat to FedEx's Ground segment?Conclusion: The Express business at FedEx has been a segment with little or no volume growth for years, thus the Memphis-based transport giant had to reduce costs and improve productivity in the segment, only to seemingly find after management righted the Express ship, the Ground segment could be coming under pressure in the last 4 - 5 quarters.It could also be that like Amazon and retail in the late 1990's, Amazon as a parcel delivery threat is just too small to matter right now.The stock seems fairly valued at its current price around $160, with a number of tailwinds (lower oil, large share repurchases, etc.) now fading, but not entirely gone.Here is the year-over-year change in the segment operating margins for the last 12 quarters:Source: FedEx's FactBook, earnings reports, 10-Q'sTo complete the analysis, and this should have been done in the 2nd table, here is the exact reported segment operating margin for each of the above quarters, so readers can prove the math:Source: FedEx Factbook, earnings reports, 10-Q'sIt is clear that the PIP vastly improved Express margins, while Ground might be feeling some pressure the last 4 - 5 quarters, and Freight has also improved their margins (Freight margins were low-single-digits to negative from 2009 through 2013).What I'll be listening for on the September 20th conference call:1. Organic revenue growth, ex-TNT?2. Too early to tell if there are additional cost savings with TNT integration?3. Has FDX Ground lost any share or felt any competitive pressure from the plethora of same-day or 2-hour delivery services?4. With the tailwinds fading on the share repurchases and the lower jet fuel expense from lower crude oil, how does PIP continue?Fred Smith has been a great founder and CEO. I love listening to him on the conference calls and Q&A, but the Amazon threat is seemingly different from anything FDX has faced in terms of competitive pressure (I would think) given Amazon's complete control of the transaction from purchase of any item to delivery.With the exception of one position bought in March, 2000 at $34 and change, clients hold no positions in FedEx, waiting for lower prices."
4007744,83156,2016-09-22T02:47:54-04:00,"FedEx had a better than expected quarter.
        Management continues to overestimate economic strength.
        FDX is an interesting choice for long-term investors, but those looking for a short-term trade should stay on the sidelines after the latest price bounce.","Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are up 7% since the company announced better-than-expected results for the latest quarter. Revenues increased 19.7%, beating estimates by $890 million, and adjusted EPS of $2.90 beat by $0.12. Non-GAAP EPS, adjusted for restructuring and acquisition costs related to the acquisition of TNT Express, increased 20% over the same period last year. This acquisition was the main reason for the large year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings (organic sales increased just 4.7%). We dissect some of the number to help you form a clearer picture of the outlook for FedEx.FedEx can be a useful company to follow because management routinely provides forecasts of US and global GDP growth, and the drivers behind those forecasts. The problem, of course, is when those forecasts are inaccurate, which has been the case over the past few quarters. In the latest quarter, management lowered its 2016 US GDP growth forecast 20 bps to 1.6%. FDX also revised down its global GDP outlook 10 bps to 2.2% for 2016. This is on top of last quarter's downward revisions: in Q416 management lowered its 2016 US GDP growth forecast 40 bps to 1.8%, and its global GDP forecast 20 bps. I expressed concern in the past that management was being too optimistic about the outlook for economic growth, and I feel that it still is. The outlook for economic growth has important implications for a cyclical company such as FDX, and management bases its sales and earnings projections on future GDP expectations. We remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for FDX due to secular e-commerce tailwinds, but think that investors should be cautious given the more challenging short-term conditions.FDX's latest results show signs of a slowing economy. Revenues in the Express segment increased just 0.1% y/y. With the exception of TNT Express (flat revenues), this was FDX's worst-performing segment in terms of revenue growth, and this makes sense. Express transports time-sensitive packages. When the economy is healthy, consumers and businesses are willing to pay up for overnight, same-day, and next-day delivery services, and the business does well. Average domestic volumes increased 1% in the US (the same rate of increase as last year), while international volumes declined 1%, reflecting weaker priority volumes. An increase in package yields was predominately responsible for growth in this segment, rather than stronger demand for overnight shipping (which would have resulted in higher volumes).It therefore isn't very surprising that FedEx Ground (up 12%) was the company's best performing segment in terms of revenue growth. Like in previous quarters, we suspect that some of the demand for Express orders shifted to the Ground segment, as fewer customers were willing to pay premiums for priority shipping. Average daily volume increased 10%, and average package yield increased 2% as the company continued to gain market share. The 12% increase for the segment is a big deceleration compared to last year's growth, but last year's results aren't very comparable due to an acquisition and a change in accounting standards (FDX started reporting Smart Post revenues on a gross rather than net basis, which increases revenue, but lowers margins). It was therefore a pretty strong quarter for Ground, and we expect that this segment will continue to pace growth in the coming quarters.Conclusion:We are optimistic about the long-term outlook for FedEx. The company has a formidable competitive position in the US shipping oligopoly and will benefit from the shift to e-commerce for years to come. Consumers aren't just buying more goods online, they are also starting to buy bulkier things (TV's, mattresses, etc.), which should translate into higher pricing for FDX. Starting January 2, FDX will raise shipping rates by an average of 3.9% for Express and an average of 4.9% for Ground and Freight. This is a response to UPS's (NYSE:UPS) announcement that it would raise shipping rates 4.9%, but we don't know if it is the right move as the economy continues to weaken. With consumers becoming more sensitive to price, FDX could take share from UPS by keeping its rates lower. FDX is an interesting choice for long-term investors, but those looking for a short-term trade should stay on the sidelines after the latest stock price bounce."
4008290,26861,2016-09-25T10:22:26-04:00,"FedEx's current valuation is close to fair value based on a low-growth environment.Despite reduced GDP guidance from the company, FedEx has displayed stable volume growth through 2016, led by the Ground segment.The TNT Express deal will add substantial volume and revenue growth for fiscal year 2017.","OverviewSource: Yahoo! FinanceFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) finished the week up nearly 10 percent after the company reported on its fiscal year 2017 first-quarter results. The results were not spectacular, but they beat analyst estimates and, more importantly, displayed a continued trend at par and/or above the competition.FedEx's outlook for U.S. and global growth was reduced. The company now expects U.S. GDP at 1.6 percent for 2016 and 2.3 percent for 2017 driven by consumer spending. Globally, GDP was revised to grow at 2.2 percent during 2016 and at 2.6 percent during 2017. A key driver for accelerated global growth is predicated on industrial segment improvement.Investors also got their first look at the TNT Express deal results, which has provided FedEx with the potential to overtake United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) on a total revenue basis. Despite the added package and freight volumes and revenue, TNT Express was not accretive during the first quarter on a GAAP basis. Management expects TNT Express to be dilutive on a GAAP basis and accretive on an adjusted basis for fiscal year 2017.Source: Company financials and personal databaseRecently, FedEx has had benefit plan impacts which have created a much more substantial diversion between GAAP and adjusted earnings, or non-GAAP earnings. Some investors may feel less comfortable relying upon non-GAAP earnings, but the bottom line is that many adjustments for net income are also reflected in operations from cash flows. Paying attention to acquisitions, restructurings, impairments and pension charges are key, but ultimately cash flow will drive sustained growth for the business.Source: Company financials and personal databaseDespite the dip in operating cash during the first quarter, FedEx has continued to grow both operating cash flow and capex over the past few years. The company is approaching $6 and $5 billion for operating cash and capex, respectively.TNT Express should be a marginal contributor to increasing operating cash, but from a volume and revenue perspective, first-quarter results were strong. During the first quarter, TNT Express added an over 20 percent increase in package volume to over 325 million. For freight tons, TNT Express added a nearly 33 percent increase in freight tons to over 480,000. Combined, these volume increases led to a 27 percent increase in revenue to $8.5 billion for the quarter.FedEx has witnessed its P/E multiple contract from around 20 times earnings to 15.5 of late. Diluted earnings per share growth has declined some, but still has performed well with 16 percent growth as of the most recent fiscal year. Revenue growth has picked up as well from organic performance in fiscal year 2016 and will increase at a more rapid pace from the TNT Express deal in 2017.The stock price is close to fair value for 2017 based upon the current valuation level and macro environment considerations. Despite the current challenging environment, FedEx has continued to witness stable volume growth for all of its operating segments. Expectations for improved GDP during 2017 could serve as a catalyst for P/E multiple expansion, but 2016 has not offered any basis to justify strong expectations that 2017 will be significantly better.FedEx Express Operating PerformanceSource: Company financials and personal databaseU.S. domestic package revenue reflected over 56 percent of total package revenue for the Express segment at $9 billion during the previous three quarters for 2016. Overall, total package revenue was flat at $15.9 billion. All 2016 comparison to 2015 are for this time period. Overall, U.S. domestic package volume was up just below 2 percent versus last year.U.S. overnight box and envelope reflected nearly 70 percent of total U.S. domestic package volume and both were up over 4 percent versus last year. U.S. deferred packages were down just below 3.5 percent as customers have shifted away from this product of late. Overall, the composite yield was up 1 percent driven by a 4 percent increase for U.S. deferred as both overnight box and envelope were marginally down.Source: Company financials and personal databaseInternational accounted for the remaining 44 percent of total package revenue for the Express segment at $6.9 billion. International priority package volume was down 1.6 percent whereas economy was up 2.8 percent versus last year. Overall, total international export volumes were up 1 percent.International domestic package volumes were up just below 4 percent versus last year. The substantial majority of international package volume was driven by domestic products reflecting 60 percent of the total.For composite package yield, international export products witnessed a decline just below 3 percent versus last year. This was led by priority products which reflected nearly 70 percent of the international export total. International domestic package yields were down nearly 8 percent, but revenue per package is substantially lower at below $6 per package versus the $54 per package amount for exports.Source: Company financials and personal databaseU.S. freight revenue reflected over 63 percent of total freight revenue, which was up 3.5 percent versus last year. U.S. freight tons shipped through the Express segment reflect 73 percent of the total at 814,000 tons for 2016. Performance was up over 9 percent versus 2015, while international freight tons shipped were down 9.5 percent, led by airfreight. Overall, ton performance was up just below 4 percent versus last year.The composite yield for revenue per ton was relatively flat overall. U.S. performance was up 4 percent and international performance was down over 1 percent, largely driven by the 25 percent decline in airfreight revenue per ton.FedEx Ground Operating PerformanceSource: Company financials and personal databaseThe Ground segment continued to lead growth as total revenue was up 25 percent to $11.8 billion in 2016. Package volume was up over 11 percent to nearly 1.5 billion. Revenue per package was up 6 percent to over $8 per package.FedEx has made substantial progress with its Ground segment. The company has grown to nearly 63 percent of UPS's business on the most recent comparative quarters for 2016. FedEx's growth has been three times that of UPS's package volume.FedEx LTL Operating PerformanceSource: Company financials and personal databaseFedEx Freight segment revenues were up just below 2.5 percent for 2016 to $4.7 billion. From a tonnage perspective, FedEx witnessed growth of 5 percent led by 16 percent improvement from the economy segment. Seventy percent of tonnage was driven by priority products which were up 1 percent versus last year.Composite revenue per hundred-weight was down 2 percent, which was driven by a 10 percent decline for economy products. Priority products were up nearly 1 percent. FedEx has continued to lead all LTL peers through tonnage performance.Source: Company financials and personal databaseLTL shipments were up 8 percent versus last year. This was more balanced as economy and priority shipments were up 9 and 7 percent, respectively. Similar to tonnage, nearly 70 percent of shipments were generated from priority products. The fact that shipments have increased at a faster rate versus tonnage signals that the average weight per shipment has declined, which has been at just below 3 percent for the year.Revenue per shipment decreased by 4.5 percent versus last year. This was led by priority which was down 5 percent. Yields for both tonnage and shipments have been down, but not substantially lower than other LTL peers. As some LTL peers have been eliminating less profitable customers, FedEx could be benefiting on the economy side.ConclusionDespite a tough year for transports, FedEx has performed well from a volume perspective. The company has outperformed its peers for both Ground and LTL segments, while remaining highly competitive for Express products.Declining fuel surcharges have continued to weigh on all of FedEx's operating segments. Next year, the company will have a lower comparable baseline for fuel surcharges and a potentially lower baseline for GDP.The stock price is up 17 percent to date and may not have much higher to go for the year. GDP revisions continue to go lower whether looking to the Fed, or companies like FedEx. A short-term catalyst from the holiday shopping season could emerge as e-commerce record sales will likely occur.Aside from this though, consumers are not expected to significantly open up their wallets. Despite lower baseline comps, sentiment is not strong at the moment for GDP prospects in the near term."
4008998,26891,2016-09-28T13:39:30-04:00,"Toni Sacconaghi, Bank of America and component orders all suggest the iPhone 7 is seeing stronger-than-expected demand.Amazon reportedly wants to build out its own shipping network, as shipping costs continue to rise.BlackBerry badly misses sales estimates as revenue declines nearly 30% year over year. Despite this, the stock is rallying.","iPhone expectations increasingShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are still seeing upside this week, this time on renewed optimism for its iPhone 7. Some reports show the company is ratcheting up component orders for the device, while noted Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi sees stronger average selling prices. He suggests that ASPs for the new iPhone could climb to $679 next quarter, ahead of consensus estimates of $659 and far ahead of the $595 ASP it garnered in Q3 2016.Bank of America analysts also estimate that the device could outsell the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in the first half of 2017 vs. the first half of 2015, (remember what a big deal the 6 was?).All of this is to say, expectations are improving for the new device. This is both good and bad. Good in the sense that, if true, demand is heating up for the iPhone 7 and that will drive positive results for Apple. Increased expectations can be bad too though, especially if investors get too high hopes. I don't think we're anywhere near those levels of optimism though.The stock is still some $20 per share below its highs and investors were right to be dismissive of the company when it introduced the iPhone 6s. Cosmetically, the 7 is not all that different, but its internals are much improved. The question remains, will this be enough of a catalyst to bolster iPhone sales for the next three quarters? (Assuming the last quarter sees a drop as consumers wait for the 10-year anniversary iPhone next year).All indications at the moment say ""Yes, it's enough,"" and that's good for investors and Apple.Amazon, the shipping kingWe've all heard about Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) jet leases and drone-delivery ambitions. However, does the company really pose a threat to companies like UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX)?According to companies' management, it's not a huge concern. At least for the moment.From SA News:It's true that building out an entire shipping and logistics network would be quite difficult. And while the company's heavy investments into own logistics network has been impressive, many wonder if the company has the resources to complete the so-called ""last mile"" of delivery. Or for that matter, if it would want to.In some instances - say in urban settings - perhaps Amazon would have the ability to build out a network that allows it to deliver a large amount of packages to a lot of people in a smaller area. Given that it's only delivering Amazon packages, perhaps suburban locations could work too. But rural seems like it would be quite difficult and perhaps it would be best for the company to stick with other companies to complete the final leg.Like I said on Tuesday about the company's Prime Video aspirations, I am not the one to question the management of a company like Amazon. The stock is after all, hitting new all-time highs as we speak.However, it's obvious that building out a complete, end-to-end delivery network will not be an easy task for anyone, including Amazon. But that doesn't mean there aren't alternatives, especially given the shipping costs the company currently shoulders.BlackBerry is back?Shares of BlackBerry (BBRY) are off its highs Wednesday, but are still up on the day despite posting a 28% decline in sales, which also missed estimates by more than 10%. The $352 million in revenues were almost $42 million short of expectations looking for roughly $394 million.It wasn't all bad though: Earnings per share of $0.00 came in 5 cents per share ahead of expectations. CFO James Yersh announced that he is leaving the company for personal reasons, while the company also announced that all of its internal hardware development will be outsourced.Given that both hardware and software badly missed sales expectations - although, it was far worse for the former - one might begin to wonder if it isn't just the end of an era when it comes to hardware, but possibly the end of an era when it comes to BlackBerry as a whole.The company's software and security has been touted as a strong asset for BlackBerry for the past several years. Basically, since its hardware division began taking a massive nosedive that clearly isn't over yet.However, with software and services failing to exceed expectations, one has to wonder how many companies and customers really believe in BlackBerry's offerings. For overall sales, the lowest expectations on the Street was $371.3 million. Even by that margin, BlackBerry missed by a ton. As the old saying goes, they couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat.At some point, one would think/hope that sales will eventually bottom and allow the company to show revenue growth in the future. It's better-than-expected earnings results is also something to be semi-optimistic about, even if it's just bad instead of horrible.But as its market share continues to dwindle, it's hard to imagine sales rebounding. Perhaps BlackBerry would be best off abandoning its hardware division altogether and instead focusing on software, services and solutions.While the stock is rallying, it just seems to me that there are better investment alternatives, rather than putting money in a company and waiting for it to start doing poorly, as opposed to terribly."
4005256,24491,2016-09-09T13:55:32-04:00,"Secular trends including global trade growth and the ongoing proliferation of e-commerce are expected to drive increased demand for FedEx's services.Though FedEx's business requires substantial capital investments, it also generates significant amounts of operating cash flow.Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamFor those that don't know FedEx (NYSE:FDX), the company provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. It has a number of long-term financial goals that are worth mentioning right away: 10% operating margin, annual EPS growth of 10%-15%, grow profitable revenue, improve cash flows, increase ROIC, and grow its dividend. We like the focus on ROIC. Secular trends including global trade growth and the ongoing proliferation of e-commerce are expected to drive increased demand for FedEx's services for the foreseeable future, and the company is working to leverage efficiencies created in its network to drive future earnings growth.Though FedEx's business requires substantial capital investments (capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues have averaged more than 8.5% in fiscal years 2013-2016), it also generates significant amounts of operating cash flow. The firm's balance sheet health has deteriorated in recent quarters as a result of the acquisition of TNT Express in late fiscal 2016. Long-term debt leapt to ~$13.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 from ~$7.25 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. While we like the long-term opportunities the deal presents FedEx, management will more than likely be allocating additional capital to deleveraging initiatives in the near term.Evaluating Fedex's Dividend ConsiderationsImage Source: ValuentumWhat Is The Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge?The Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the image above, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. FedEx's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's 5-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next 5 years of expected cash dividends paid. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the 5-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk.On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time. Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.FedEx's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. It was founded in 1971 and is based in Memphis.• We like the company's decision to acquire TNT Express, though the latter struggled leading up to the deal. FedEx has gained access to the firm's European distribution network, while TNT will be able to capitalize on FedEx's global one.• An investment in FedEx is not without risks. The firm's operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities, and package-handling and sort equipment. Capital expenditures are generally 7%-9% of sales. FedEx ended fiscal 2016 with ~$3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, however, a nice balance.• Global trade growth and e-commerce continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 30.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 0.7% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively WEAK.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At FedEx, cash flow from operations decreased about 32% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 29% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think FedEx is worth $164 per share with a fair value range of $131-$197.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 7.6% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3- year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.6%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.7%, which is below FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $164 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $131 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $197 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $164 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $219 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $164 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

4002370,68695,2016-08-26T10:42:42-04:00,"FedEx is expected to see improving Adjusted ROA (ROA') levels, but management’s concerns about the sustainability of increases in revenues, margins, and EPS indicate that this may be unwarranted.FDX is trading at a 1.2x Adjusted Value to Assets Ratio (V/A'), near historical averages.At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for substantial expansion in ROA' levels and continued Adjusted Asset (Asset') growth.FedEx's poor historical profitability, as well as management’s concerns about the sustainability of increases in revenues and cash flows, imply that market expectations may be too bullish.","Performance and Valuation Prime™ ChartThe PVP chart below reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in, in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.The apostrophe after ROA', Asset', V/A', and V/E' is the symbol for ""prime"" which means ""adjusted."" These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove as-reported earnings, asset, liability, and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions. To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion, please refer to our guide here.FDX has seen historically cyclical ROA' performance, increasing from 3.3% in 2001 to a peak of 6.1% in 2007. However, ROA' declined to a mere 0.7% in 2009, and has recovered slowly, to just 4.6% in 2015. Meanwhile, Asset' growth had been consistently positive prior to 2009, ranging from 3%-11% levels. Afterwards, growth slowed in 2009-2010 to negative levels, before rebounding to 7.7% in 2011, and ranging from 1%-8% levels since.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins, and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down ROA' into its DuPont formula parts, Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns, which are the cleaned up margins and turns metrics used to calculate ROA'. The chart below details both Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns historically, to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance.The firm's cyclical trend in ROA' performance has been driven by cyclical Earnings' Margins and stable Asset' Turns. Earnings' Margins held around 4% levels from 2000-2003, before increasing to a peak of 6.4% in 2007, and subsequently declining to only 0.8% in 2009. Earnings' Margins then recovered to 3.5% in 2010, and have ranged from 4%-5% levels since. Meanwhile, Asset' Turns have been consistently stable, ranging from 0.9x-1.0x levels, which has resulted in muted ROA' levels, as the firm has struggled to improve returns on its massive Asset' base which includes the less profitable airplane fleet used in FedEx Express.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends, to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.FDX is trading at a 1.2x V/A', near historical averages. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for an improving ROA', from 4.6% in 2015 to 8.7% in 2020, accompanied by 3.3% Asset' growth.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentHowever, analysts have bearish expectations relative to the market, expecting ROA' to decline to 2.5% in 2016 before recovering to modest 3% levels in 2017, accompanied by 9.8% Asset' growth.Furthermore, Valens' qualitative analysis highlights that management appears concerned about the timely execution of their profit improvement plan and their ability to improve yield in Express with cost management. Furthermore, they appear concerned about the sustainability of increases in revenues, margins, and cash flows.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price, and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential prices for FDX at various levels of profitability (in terms of ROA') and growth (Asset' growth.) Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red.To justify current prices, FDX would need to see ROA' nearly double relative to historical profitability levels, with continued growth in Assets', or would need to drive Asset' growth well above previous historical highs. Considering management concerns about cost initiatives and their ability to drive top- and bottom-line improvements, these targets may be too aggressive. Additionally, given current competitive pressures in FDX's markets as well as their already substantial Asset' base, it is less likely that they will be able to meet market expectations, and equity upside may be limited.To find out more about FedEx Corporation, click here to access the open beta of the Valens Research database.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Rafael Formoso.

4001705,88266,2016-08-24T01:20:48-04:00,FedEx Express and FedEx Ground run separate operations leading to large inefficiencies across the FedEx network.Integrating FedEx Express and Ground to work with each other would make FedEx a much stronger competitor against upstarts like Amazon Prime.Utilizing its resources more efficiently could allow FedEx to accept many more packages during peak periods such as the Christmas season.,"Img 1: A FedEx Sorting CenterI recently had the opportunity to work with a company that does a lot of shipping via FedEx (NYSE:FDX). It was an interesting experience and brought to light some of the issues I believe FedEx has when competing against upstarts such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. These issues while leading to some inefficiencies are not major problems at the moment, but as Amazon becomes more aggressive with its delivery solutions and possibly pitch them as an alternative to FedEx and UPS (NYSE:UPS) I see them becoming bigger issues for FedEx.The Optimal RouteImg 2: Actual FedEx Package Routing (Red) vs Optimal (BLUE)During my time I tracked the journey of a package from Tampa to Honduras. This package took a route that was far from the most optimal. It was sent from Tampa - Memphis - Miami - Tegucigalpa rather than the more optimal route of FedEx Ground from Tampa to Miami followed by Air from Miami to Tegucigalpa. An additional issue resulting from this was that when the package arrived in Miami after its detour via Memphis the flight to Honduras for that morning had already left and the package was stuck there for an additional day. Had it traveled by ground to Miami and then by air from Miami to Tegucigalpa, FedEx would not only have generated substantial savings by traveling less than half the distance, but it would also have made it to its destination a day quicker.Table 1: Tampa - Tegucigalpa Optimal Routing vs. FedEx RoutingTo be fair, an experience with a package going from Tampa to Port Au Prince, Haiti via DHL did the same style routing, from Tampa - Cincinnati - Miami - Haiti. The only difference, though, is DHL does not have much of a U.S ground network left after largely dismantling its U.S operations in 2009. FedEx who has the luxury of having an extensive ground network in the United States should be using this to its competitive advantage.The problems with the integration between FedEx Air and Ground are not just international. An overnight package from Los Angeles to San Francisco will fly via air while sending it on a truck would yield substantial cost savings and also have it arrive in San Francisco by the next morning. Some even more crazy examples are Los Angeles to Burbank, a 1-hour drive that is served by air at FedEx along with Los Angeles to Ontario and Orange County.Img 3: FedEx Rates and Transit Times Burbank - Los AngelesA 5lb package from Burbank 91505 to Los Angeles 90012 costs $66.68 when sent via the fastest option. This option will have it arrive the next day by 8:00 am. The cheapest option, at $8.53 will have the package arrive within 1 business day. The difference between these two methods is that the $66.68 method will be sent by air while the $8.53 method will travel by ground. In both of these scenarios, however, they could travel by ground and arrive by the next morning. FedEx could charge $66.88 and send the package via ground giving it Priority and delivering it by 8 am the next morning while the $8.53 package would also travel on the same truck but not be delivered until later the next day.Christmas time is when this will really begin to hurt FedEx and its earnings potential. By needlessly sending packages around the air network when they could have used ground transport FedEx is using resources inefficiently. Both the Tampa to Memphis and Memphis to Miami segments could have been filled with packages that actually need to travel those segments by air. With 100% load factors on many of its flights around Christmas causing FedEx to have to turn packages away, a more efficient use of all of the FedEx assets from Ground to Air could allow FedEx to accept and carry many more of these packages at a much lower cost.Img 3: Amazon Prime AirAmazon Prime has managed to really nail the integration between air and ground. Amazon systems will calculate everything from the optimal warehouse to send a package from, along with an optimal mix of air and ground transportation to have the item arrive within 1 or 2 days based on the customer selection. This integration will allow Amazon to offer much more competitive rates than FedEx while at the same time offering shorter transit time for packages. In less than a year since being publicized, the operation has already grown to include a fleet of aircraft and an air cargo hub in Ohio.ConclusionAs online e-commerce continues to grow rapidly, and consumers continue to shift their purchase of everything from cereals to computers from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet, companies like FedEx and UPS stand to gain substantially from the increase in parcel shipments. While I am optimistic for FedEx and believe that the company is a good long-term buy at this price, I also believe that investors should watch for the company to do more to integrate its Express and Ground divisions rather than running them completely separately. Failure to do so has the potential to allow upstart rivals like Amazon Prime to become much stronger competitors against FedEx on both product and price."
3989010,101982,2016-07-18T04:13:32-04:00,"Investors got additional clarity on the TNT acquisition, Ground and ecommerce update at a recent investor meeting.The TNT acquisition is accretive to earnings and allows FedEx to gain additional market share from UPS.FedEx Ground will be a key driver in profitability due to better pricing.Amazon is only 3% of revenue but the overall ecommerce growth is a positive for FedEx.I am positive on FedEx because of its TNT acquisition, market share expansion and valuation discount relative to UPS.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) recently held an investor meeting to provide additional TNT's near and long-term impact, the competition against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Express and Ground's margin outlook, free cash potential and its valuation discount against UPS. I came away very impressed by FedEx and its growth potential due to the resilient US consumer, which will allow FedEx to counter the weak industrial and global trade trend. FedEx is trading at 13x next year's consensus earnings and this is cheaper than UPS that is trading at 20x earnings. Based on both fundamental and valuation analysis, I believe that FedEx is a better investment than UPS.FedEx acquired TNT back in May to expand its delivery services in Europe where FedEx did not have a large presence. This acquisition also allows FedEx to challenge UPS on the global stage by expanding its distribution and delivery networks. FedEx's June call did not offer many details on the expected impact from TNT for FY17 so the investment community is expecting more clarity in the upcoming FYQ1 call. At the meeting, FedEx pointed out that pricing and TNT will be critical on improving the profitability of its Express service. I note that Express' capex and high fixed cost means that its 10% operating margin still seems low and that a more reasonable margin should be around low to mid-teens.Source: FedEx, the authorOne way to improve margins is to increase pricing and this depends on the integration of TNT that will give FedEx a leading network in Europe and FedEx's existing market. This will allow FedEx to improve its revenue opportunity and serve customers such as European corporations that have been using DHL and UPS. When FedEx and TNT are combined we can see that they will rank ahead of UPS in all the key markets. This will lead to attractive revenue potential once full integration is complete in the next three to four years.Source: FedEx, the authorFedEx's European business was mostly focusing on import and export, and the company did not have a European ground shipping business. TNT addresses this weakness with a pan-European ground offering and this will help FedEx to improve its local pickup and delivery, which will lead to long-term international Express profitability. When we compare FedEx and UPS in the Ground Shipping segment, FedEx has a net advantage of 26.7%, but I think this number will increase as FedEx integrate TNT into its import and export network over time.Source: FedEx, the authorAs for FedEx Ground, this will remain as the company's key driver for free cash flow and return on invested capital. Ground has been experiencing margin pressure in the past few quarters but I think this should improve in the coming quarters with the help of ecommerce, improved efficiency, automation and better pricing. When compared with the pricing in FedEx Express, FedEx Ground's pricing is even better thanks to US Postal Service that has been raising prices on packages. As such, FedEx has also been raising prices by 3-4% for the past few quarters and the company continues to expect higher prices to keep up with the competition.One interesting data point was that despite the increase in prices, customer demand for FedEx Ground remains resilient and it seems that there is no price elasticity for oversized packages. This is actually quite important for FedEx because large shipments accounts for 10% of the total and is expected to grow faster than the smaller packages. Right now, FedEx ground has 30% of the market share compared with 60% for UPS. Although FedEx's market share is still small, it is an improvement from the 8% when FedEx acquired the Ground business. This pace of market share expansion is very impressive, and I think FedEx will continue to leverage its net speed advantage to further increase its market share.Source: FedEx, the authorFinally, Amazon has been mentioned as a competitor to FedEx and UPS but it's important to note a few things. First, Amazon is only 3% of FedEx's total revenue so the impact is minimal. Second, ecommerce will remain a driver for FedEx's growth and this will continue to support FedEx's Domestic Express business.Conclusion, I like FedEx's long-term prospects in the global shipping space and its medium-term growth in Europe. I believe that the TNT acquisition will be accretive to earnings and its long-term competitive advantage over UPS. I also see the valuation discount relative to UPS is not justified because of FedEx's higher than expected growth and market share gain."
3991929,85096,2016-07-27T06:24:11-04:00,FedEx is growing its business strongly as more and more companies are increasing their sales on the Internet.Total return outperformed the Dow by 30.69% for my 42.7-month test period.Dividend is below average at 1.0% and has been increased in 7 of the last 10 years.,"This article is about FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) and why it's a total return growth company that is being reviewed by The Good Business Portfolio. FedEx Corp. provides a portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services under the FedEx brand. It is projected that E-commerce will grow at a 9.5% CAGR for the next few years, therefore growing FedEx Corp. revenues and earnings. Fundamentals of FedEx Corp. will be looked at in the following topics, The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, Total Return And Yearly Dividend, Last Quarter's Earnings, Company Business Overview, and Takeaways And Recent Portfolio Changes.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.FedEx Corp. passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, momentum, total return, and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.FedEx Corp. is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $42.7 billion. The nearest company that is a competitor is United Parcel (NYSE:UPS) with a capitalization of $76 billion, but does not have the greater growth potential of FedEx Corp. FedEx Corp. cash flow easily covers the low dividend and leaves plenty of cash to buy more trucks and planes to meet the expanding business requirement.FedEx Corp. has a dividend yield of 1.0% and its dividend has been increased for 7 of the last ten years, just meeting my guideline for dividend growth. The payout ratio of the dividend is low at 14% over 5 years. The dividend is below average for the market. FedEx Corp. is therefore not an income investment, but great total return company with a growing business that will make you money over time as the economy grows.FedEx Corp. last yearly cash flow is improving at $4.46 billion which leaves FedEx Corp. plenty of cash, allowing it to pay its low dividend and have much left over for its continued business expansion and stock buy backs. The average dividend payout ratio over the last 5 years is 14%, which is low and allows FedEx Corp. to invest in growing the business for great total returns.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.1% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5%. FedEx Corp. has a three-year CAGR of 15% more than meeting my requirement. Looking back five years $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $17,900 today (from S&P IQ). This makes FedEx Corp. a good investment for the total return growth investor.FedEx Corp. S&P Capital IQ rating is Five star or strong buy with a target price of $195. FedEx Corp. is then under priced by 22% at present and a good choice for the total return growth investor. FedEx Corp. PE is relatively low at 16 for their projected 2017 earnings, while UPS is at the target price and fairly priced at present.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio, the total return guideline was just added to my list of guidelines. FedEx Corp. did much better than the Dow baseline in my 42.7 month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 42.7 month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. Modeling the Dow average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the 11 guidelines as a filter for company selection. The good total return and low dividend makes FedEx Corp. a choice for the total return growth investor. The dividend has been increased for 7 of the last ten years. DOW's 42.7 month total return baseline is 41.73%. The total return during the test period for FedEx Corp. is above the DOW average at 72.42% beating the DOW baseline by 30.69%. In 2013 a good year for the market FedEx Corp. beat the DOW gain of 27% in total return by 21.67% at 48.67% total return. YTD total return is 7.54% about 1% better than the DOW average. Looking at these data points FedEx Corp. pretty much beats the DOW average in good and bad markets and follows the economy with a good beat in total return overall.Dow Baseline 41.73%Last Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter on June 21, 2016 FedEx Corp. reported earnings that beat expected earnings at $3.30 compared to last year at $2.66 and expected at $3.27. Revenue was higher at $13.0 billion up from last year by 7.3% year over year and beat estimated revenue by $220 million. This was a good report showing good improvement from the same quarter of 2015. Earnings for the next quarter will be out in late September and is expected to be $2.80 compared to last year at $2.42 FedEx Corp. guided there total earnings for 2017 to $11.75-$12.25 enough to cover the dividend with a lot left over. They also bought back $2.7 billion of their shares in 2016 and the operating margin increased to 11.7% from 10.5%. This year over year gain shows the grow potential of FedEx Corp, and it should continue as E-commerce increases going forward.Business OverviewFedEx Corp. provides a portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services under the FedEx brand. The Company offers its services through companies constituting four business segments: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services. FedEx Express offers a range of domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. The company also provides printing and other office services.Forrester Research Inc. did a report on projected E-retail growth to be from $263 Billion in 2013 and growing to $414 billion in 2018, a 9.5% CAGR. They also estimated that the percentage on E-retail sales would continue to increase as a percentage of the total sales.One of my guidelines is: would you buy the whole business if you could right now? I would buy FedEx Corp. Its growth is almost assured as the population grows and more and more companies sell their products over the internet that need shipping. I also don't think the fly by night idea of delivering products by drones is anywhere in the future (next 15 years). The FAA has published very strict rules that would not let this happen.Takeaways and Recent Portfolio ChangesFedEx Corp. is a good investment for the total return growth investor with its well above average total return compared to the DOW average over my test period and other periods. FedEx Corp. will be definitely be considered for The Good Business Portfolio when an open slot occurs.Trimmed Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) from 5.5% to 5.3% just took a little off the table since nothing has been said lately about the buyout.Sold some CAB covered calls, sold August $55's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that CAB goes up so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a Double.Sold some covered calls on Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), sold August 50's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that HOG goes up so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a Double.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. Below are the six top positions in The Good Business Portfolio. Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 8.7% of the portfolio, Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) is 8.0% of the portfolio, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 7.8% of portfolio, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 7.8% of the Portfolio, Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Fund II (NYSE:EOS) is 6.9% of the Portfolio and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is 6.6% of the portfolio, therefore MO and JNJ are now in trim position with Boeing, Home Depot, Eaton Vance equity Fund II and Walt Disney getting close. Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on individual 787 plane costs, announced in the 2015 fourth quarter earnings call. JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post Brexit world.For the total Good Business Portfolio please see my recent article on Good Business Portfolio: 2016 first-quarter earnings and performance for the complete portfolio list and performance. Become a real time follower and you will get each quarters performance after the earnings season is over.I have written individual articles on CAB, JNJ, EOS, GE, IR, MO, BA, AA, Omega Health Investors and HD that are in The Good Business Portfolio and other companies being evaluated by the portfolio. If you have an interest please look for them in my list of previous articles.Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale. This is how I manage my IRA retirement account and the opinions on the companies are my own."
3985939,83156,2016-07-03T01:01:04-04:00,"FedEx reported a strong fourth quarter on the surface.But the results are misleading, and economic conditions are worsening.Investors thinking about buying now should proceed carefully.","On the surface, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) had a strong fourth quarter. Revenue increased 7.3% year-over-year, beating estimates by $220 million, while EPS of $3.30 beat estimates by $0.02. Lower fuel costs helped boost profitability, and adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points for the full year. But the reported numbers are misleading. The latest results offer further evidence that the US and global economies are slowing, and that FedEx is likely facing a prolonged period of weak growth and sluggish demand.FedEx is a great company to follow because it provides useful insight on the health of the US and global economies. Management also gives forecasts for economic conditions one-two years out, and in doing so, adds some transparency to the outlook. Problems occur when management is either wrong about their forecasts or deliberately misleads investors. Recently they have been overly optimistic, and in the latest earnings call management lowered forecasts again. FDX expects US GDP growth of 1.8% and 2.4% for 2016 and 2017 respectively (a 40 basis point decline from the prior quarter), led by growth in consumer spending. Management projects global GDP to grow 2.3% and 2.8% in 2016 and 2017 (a downward revision of 20 basis points from the last quarter). These assumptions are still too optimistic. The US economy grew at a 0.5% annualized rate in the first quarter of 2016, its slowest pace in two years. US GDP is unlikely to grow 1% this year, and this is a problem because management bases its operating forecasts (sales, profit margins, capital spending levels) on its economic outlook. As Chairman Fred Smith said in the latest call, ""given expectations for moderate economic growth, we believe we will continue to increase margins, EPS, cash flows, and capital returns over the next several years"".The latest results confirmed that the US and global economies are weak. In the Express segment, package yield increased 1% as higher rates offset lower fuel surcharges, but average daily package volume in the US was flat. Express was the company's lowest-growing segment, and this is important. Express transports time-sensitive packages. When the economy is healthy, consumers and businesses are willing to spend more on overnight, same-day, and next-day services, and the business does well. In the past, during periods of strength, management would decompose growth by each delivery type (overnight vs. same-day vs. next day etc.). Their failure to provide the breakdown in the latest quarter is a concern. In International Economy, the results were similar. Revenue per package was up slightly thanks to rate and discount changes, but average daily volume for priority shipping declined 2.1% year-over-year.FedEx Ground was arguably the best performing segment. Average daily package volume increased 10% year-over-year. While management attributed it to strong demand from residential and commercial customers, we think a significant portion of the volume growth was a carryover from the lost business in the Express segment as fewer customers were willing to pay premiums for priority shipping. Much of the order increase was the result of customers changing how they had their goods delivered, rather than a large increase in the number of items purchased. Pricing for this segment, on the surface, was also strong. Package yields increased 7%, but this was mainly due to FedEx reporting its SmartPost revenues on a gross basis whereas in the past it reported them on a net basis. It was not the result of customers purchasing bulkier, more expensive items.FedEx's latest results look good at first. But if you dig into the data, they confirm that the economy is slowing down, and possibly heading for recession. Management's GDP forecasts are unrealistic, which means its performance targets are as well. FDX is centering its growth strategy around e-commerce, which will continue to grow at a faster pace than GDP. Transportation companies such as FedEx play an integral role in the success of e-commerce, but this strategy also introduces a large element of risk. The firm has spent heavily on modernizing its Express fleet and expanding the Ground network. These capital-intensive projects leave FedEx exposed to a downturn in demand. If volumes continue to decline, negative operating leverage will make it difficult to raise margins. If the latest results are anything to go by, investors should be very cautious."
3983522,22148,2016-06-22T00:31:59-04:00,"FedEx reported strong FQ4 results, though guidance for FY17 is below analyst estimates.The package delivery company continues a trend of reporting higher earnings despite sometimes missing analyst estimates.The stock remains a cheap option in the transportation sector.","After the close, FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) posted another solid quarter to distance the delivery company from the quarterly misses of the prior year. The guidance as well should shift the market view of a company previously thought as under attack from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).The company reported an EPS of $3.30 for FQ4 to end the year earning $10.80 per share. FDX guided to fiscal 2017 earnings of $11.75 to $12.25. While the mid-point is below current analyst estimates, the amount is 11% above the just ended year.Most importantly though, the numbers change the focus that hurt the stock over the last year. Though investors focused on the earnings misses of the last two years (quarters with the green diamond below the other diamonds), FedEx continues moving the earnings trends higher. The below numbers move up from the left to the right as the company generates higher earnings each year. The results and guidance should alleviate some of the worries that led to the weak valuation. The main fear was that Amazon.com was squeezing prices too much or planning on moving business away from FedEx resulting in the earnings misses.The end result is that compared to other transportation stocks like Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), FedEx offers the more compelling valuation. The key being that FedEx is growing earnings at equal if not a faster rate in the current fiscal year, making the stock the cheapest of the group.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that weak results over the last couple years were due to operational problems and not anything related to Amazon.com. The stock is set to rally based on the improving earnings trend whether above or below analyst estimates. FedEx is the cheapest stock in this group of transportation stocks for no valid reason.Investors should own the stock on a breakout above the recent resistance around $165 or on any dip on the appearance of weak FY17 guidance."
3983260,97896,2016-06-21T07:05:00-04:00,"FedEx Express could be under pressure as the global economy slows.
        FedEx determined to improve operational efficiency.
        FedEx is expensive and could be a risky play if a recession is in the cards.","FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) has had flat year, as the stock took a dip earlier this year, but has since rebounded to where it started. FedEx is dividend into four primary segments: Express, Ground, Freight and Corporate Services. The FedEx Express segment accounts for over 57% of its revenue, as it delivers expedited packages to customers in over 220 countries, with approximately 4 million shipments per day. FedEx is set to report Q4 2016 numbers tomorrow and it could be the start of a sustained rally back to historical highs. There's no question the global economy has slowed and FedEx has done everything possible to weather the storm, so that it could stay on track with its full-year guidance and earnings expectations. I believe FedEx is a fantastic business, but if a recession is indeed coming, then FedEx will get hit very hard.FedEx Express could be under pressure as the global economy slowsFedEx express is the biggest contributor to the company's revenue stream, as we head into the latter part of 2016, we may see the $1.7 billion investment in the profit improvement program finally work its way into the financials through improved operating margins. FedEx CEO Fred Smith estimates a 12% operating margin for the express segment, as the profit improvement program makes FedEx more profitable in the long-term. With the global economy showing signs of weakness, we may see customers opting to go for cheaper, slower methods of delivery, which implies a decline in revenues from FedEx's biggest segment. If a recession is indeed in the books for the next few years, FedEx's express division may see a huge drop in sales, and we could see FedEx's stock take a gigantic hit. UPS has enjoyed next-day-air delivery growth over the last year, which is a great sign for FedEx's express segment, and we may see even better numbers, as it looks like the global economy may be slowing, but it is most likely not dead yet.FedEx determined to improve operational efficiencyFedEx had a poor average operating margin of 8.6% and net margin of 2% over the last year and there's no questions that FedEx is determined to turn this around in order to unlock value for the long run. That's why management decided to invest in the profit improvement program three years ago. Another part of this initiative to improve operational efficiency is coming from requiring its customers to package more efficiently, to save volume when transporting packages. In the last quarter, FedEx introduced weight pricing and oversize-shipment surcharges, which will penalize its customers for not packing their parcels in the most efficient manner. Such initiatives will drive long-term margins, as the initiatives will both allow for more carloads to be moved when parcels are efficiently packaged to save volume, as well as adding directly to FedEx's bottom-line when a fee is charged to a customer who is not packaging in the most efficient way. FedEx has invested in dimensional scanners, which will help provide costs for its parcels, and in the long run I see this investment paying off very fast. It's small initiatives like these which allows FedEx to rise head and shoulders above competition, and it is what will allow FedEx to drive their margins and boost profitability for long-term shareholders.Valuation and ConclusionFedEx depends on growth in the economy in order to strive. While management can't do anything about the global economy, it can take the initiative to drive its margins and improve its own operational efficiency, so that it can be more profitable in great economic times, as well as a slowed economy like the one we're in right now. FedEx has a great operational efficiency improvement strategy in place, and it will help boost its operational cash flow, which is currently at an impressive 2.6x net income. FedEx is not cheap right now, as it has a 45.9 P/E and a 3.0 P/B, both of which are higher than their five year historical average values of 21.8 and 2.4 respectively. The dividend yield is nothing to write home about at a less than impressive 0.7%. Even with management's efforts to drive profitability for the long run, I cannot recommend buying shares of FedEx right now because of its very expensive valuation, and considering the fact that we may be entering a global recession, with slowed growth currently across the board. If a recession does indeed happen, FedEx could drop -70% like it did during the last recession. I would tread carefully, and only consider FedEx if the global economy starts to show signs of strength."
4004234,70965,2016-09-06T02:17:37-04:00,"FedEx has been a longstanding favorite of ours.
        Lofty valuation and hubris from the CEO regarding competition from Amazon have us reconsidering.
        We think it's time to ring the register on FedEx.","By Parke ShallWe have been long standing fans of Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) for as long as we can remember. If you go back through our history here on Seeking Alpha you will see that we have written a slew of bullish articles on the company claiming that due to its blue-chip status and burgeoning industry thanks to online shopping, it was a stock that we wanted to own.Today we are amending that analysis and we wanted to write a relatively simple thesis as to why. We think it is time to ring the register due to the CEO's hubris about potential competition combined with an aggressive valuation.FDX data by YChartsAs you can see above, Federal Express has had a fantastic run over the last 35 years. Investors have been rewarded extremely handsomely and those that had to courage to buy the dips on the way up surely have had a lucrative investment in Federal Express.Why do we feel the fun is about to stop now?We're not 100% sure that the fun is actually going to stop right now, but we don't really like the direction that things are heading in. Federal Express is a company with a very aggressive valuation at a time when we think valuations are eventually going to be revisited. The company is currently trading at around 25x ttm earnings with $13.87B in debt compared to $3.53B cash on hand.It is no secret that the market is at all-time highs right now and there is a lot of controversy over whether or not the Federal Reserve is going to hike interest rates again. While a rate hike may bring a small correction, we believe that being on the back end of a short-term credit cycle is going to have a far greater affect not only on the market, but on the consumer.You will find very few people on Wall Street who would disagree with the assumption that we're at the end of a shorter-term credit cycle. Subprime automobile loans are becoming a concern and peer-to-peer lending has stepped into the space where banks simply just used to not extend credit to individuals. Because of this, we are expecting a modest correction to the tune of 10% to 20% over the next 4-6 quarters. We do think that the market will eventually slow down and it will become a time to pick individual equities, instead of being long the entire market.This end of a credit cycle has a negative impact on all businesses, not just FDX's business. Consumers will slow down purchases which will drive less parcel traffic and all businesses will likely feel the brunt of that. Federal Express is set up to get pulled back in, we believe, due to the company's valuation which is currently at around 25X forward earnings. The company trades slightly above the S&P average and has a valuation that is fairly aggressive no matter what type of market environment we are in.But one of the biggest threats that's not being addressed, but rather laughed at by the company and management, is the threat of one of FDX's largest customers in Amazon.com not only slowing its business with FDX but becoming a competitor and bringing its own delivery service online. Bloomberg recently reported,What you would like to hear is the CEO of Federal Express come out and acknowledge the company as a threat, informing investors and shareholders that the company is working on agreements to lock up business and retain Amazon as a customer. Instead, what we got was pretty much pure hubris from the CEO,We have seen CEOs be cavalier about threats in the past, and those are usually the situations and circumstances that wind up working against a company. We are not saying that Amazon is a threat to FDX right now, but what we are saying is in an environment where the company's valuation is aggressive, the market looks ready to top out, and we are about to see a small burst in higher yield credit, FDX simply isn't a name we want to be in anymore."
3983579,26861,2016-06-22T07:44:55-04:00,"FedEx's LTL segment reported positive results for the company's fourth quarter with revenue up over 2 percent year-over-year.Tonnage and shipment growth for the quarter continued to lead the LTL market on a year-over-year basis.Total yield performance was consistent with the previous quarter suggesting prudent yield management for LTL peers.But FedEx's economy service continued to display some aggressive pricing suggesting that regular/standard/economy LTL services may be under some pressure.Investors should continue to monitor FedEx's priority and economy services as any deterioration in pricing, may have negative impacts for the LTL market.","OverviewFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) always serves as the kick-off earnings report for transports. During the company's fourth quarter, FedEx generated $13 billion in revenue beating estimates by $220 million, and on an adjusted basis, beat diluted earnings per share, EPS by a penny at $3.29. For the fiscal year, the company generated over $50.3 billion and earned $10.80/share on an adjusted basis. Fiscal year results witnessed revenue growth of over 6 percent and adjusted diluted EPS growth of nearly 17 percent.The majority of FedEx's revenue is driven by Express and Ground services. Freight services which include less-than-truckload, LTL reflected just over 12 percent for the year. But FedEx's LTL results typically serve as an early indicator prior to the company's peer announcements.FedEx is the leading LTL company by tonnage, shipments and revenue; other public company peers include YRC Worldwide (NASDAQ:YRCW), XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) Con-Way, Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ:ODFL), United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS), ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB), Saia (NASDAQ:SAIA), Forward Air (NASDAQ:FWRD) and Roadrunner Transportation (OTCPK:RRTS).For the fourth quarter, FedEx's LTL revenue increased over 2 percent to $1.6 billion. Operating income remained flat at nearly $140 million and the operating margin and operating ratio decreased and increased by 20 basis points respectively.FedEx continued to outpace LTL market peers during the quarter for both tonnage and shipments. Total yield performance also remained consistent from the previous quarter. However, FedEx's economy services has displayed trends which have significantly contradicted LTL peer performance, including tonnage, shipments, weight per LTL shipment, revenue per shipment and revenue per hundredweight, CWT.The LTL market has remained disciplined for the most part when comparing total yield information. Fuel surcharges have weighed, but most companies have disclosed mid-single digit freight rate increases which have offset for the most part the soft demand environment.FedEx's economy service is consistent with regular or standard services offered by other LTL companies. All LTL companies also offer expedited, or priority as FedEx calls it, services for their customers. In fact, FedEx's priority service reflected nearly 70 percent for both total tonnage and shipments.During the most recent quarter however, economy service tonnage and shipments grew by 27 and 11 percent respectively, while weight per LTL shipment increased by 14 percent and revenue per CWT decreased nearly 15 percent. Other peer LTL companies do not break-out their standard versus expedited key performance indicators, KPIs. And on an aggregate basis, FedEx's KPIs are in-line with its peers.For these reasons, it would appear that the upcoming second quarter reports for LTL companies will most likely closely follow the first quarter's performance results. But investors should continue to closely monitor FedEx's priority and economy service KPIs as if the priority segment begins to weaken, the LTL market could be headed for similar challenges currently facing the truckload segment.FedEx Trends Show Improvement Driven by VolumeFedEx's quarter reporting period is roughly one month earlier than most LTL companies which report on a calendar year basis. As such, despite the fourth quarter ending the company's fiscal year, I typically compare FedEx's third and fourth quarter results against the first and second quarter results for the remainder of the LTL peers.On an aggregate basis, FedEx's tonnage increased from over 4 percent to nearly 6.5 percent; shipments increased from nearly 6.5 percent to over 9 percent and total weight per LTL shipment, revenue per shipment and revenue per CWT remained mostly flat during fiscal year 2016. Based on these results, one could posture that the LTL market could possibly be in a modest recovery mode driven by volume.Source: Company financials and personal databaseWe will need to wait and see the results from other LTL companies before assuming that FedEx's volume improvement is an indication for peers. But the recent trend of economy tonnage is something to keep an eye on. For fiscal year 2015, FedEx's economy tonnage increased 3.5 percent, but during fiscal year 2016, it increased by 25 percent. The average yield for economy tonnage also decreased by over 13 percent during fiscal year 2016, a stark contrast to the over 2 percent increase during fiscal year 2015.Priority tonnage decreased by over 4 percent during fiscal year 2016, while it increased by over 7 percent during fiscal year 2015. Yield tonange performance has been stable over the previous two fiscal years at just below 2 percent growth.Source: Company financials and personal databaseFedEx's economy shipments increased by over 9 and 3 percent for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively. Economy shipment yield increased by over 2 percent for fiscal year 2015 and declined by 1 percent during fiscal year 2016.FedEx's priority shipments increased by 2 and over 6 percent for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively. Priority shipment yield increased by nearly 3 percent for fiscal year 2015 and declined by nearly 5 percent during fiscal year 2016. Judging from FedEx's shipment yield trends, this is an area that deserves some monitoring as well, most LTL peers witnessed better yield performance during the first quarter.Overall, from an aggregate perspective, FedEx's fourth quarter was strong on volume, but continued to display declining yields for economy tonnage and both priority and economy shipments. Scrutiny of LTL peers will be key as any further erratic weakness for volume or increasing weakening yields may indicate that pricing has become more aggressive.Investor PerspectivesOther LTL companies do not break out their standard versus expedited services by KPIs similar to FedEx. Some companies have expressed softening from industrial customers leading to volume declines. Old Dominion Freight Line when questioned regarding the company's expedited service during the first quarter, only stated that performance was similar with all of the company's services.On an aggregate basis, Old Dominion Freight Line performed very close with FedEx's third quarter results for volume and outperformed FedEx for yield. The fact that FedEx witnessed such strong growth for weight per LTL economy shipment, while priority declined substantially, could suggest that existing customers chose to shift products into larger shipments with a longer delivery time.The single fact that revenue per CWT for the economy service declined by nearly 15 percent year-over-year, YOY during the fourth quarter does not completely validate that aggressive pricing has occurred, as it just is not clear whether this was primarily driven by customer retention strategies or more directly targeted against the LTL market's pricing discipline.During the first quarter reports, all we heard was a focus on yield management, increased pricing give or take 5 percent and a disciplined focus on customers within core lanes to improve density. Without an apples-to-apples ability to compare KPIs, we cannot conclude that FedEx is has reversed this course. Average fuel surcharges were down around 14 percent during the third quarter and the price of oil has been fairly stable around $50/barrel. A more stable energy climate would reduce further impacts from fuel surcharges and eventually by next year, possibly see a return to growth.It is too early to assume that pricing discipline is on the verge of significant downward pressure similar to the truckload segment. But investors with exposure to LTL companies should start focusing closely as each company reports this upcoming second quarter."
3983931,33291,2016-06-23T13:24:08-04:00,Q4 earnings are out and I discuss results.Reality surpassed expectations but there was concern over guidance which I see as unnecessary.Wait for the pullback.,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) has just pulled back. When I first opined on the name I thought it was a strong company that was a touch too expensive. I also thought it should raise its dividend which I am pleased report it recently raised 60%. Given that it has been some time since I checked in on the name I decided to take a look at the company's performance.The company has just reported a decent quarter. So how good are we talking? Well, revenue was $13 billion, rising 7.3% and beating estimates by $220 million. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were a loss of $0.26 for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $3.26 $per diluted share last year, so that is strong improvement. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and adjusted operating income rose 23% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $2.66 per share a year ago. This also beat expectations by $0.02.Part of the reason the company delivered was due to buybacks which I will discuss but the company has been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from these profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year helping to improve results.Segment specific results were also impressive for the most part. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.61 billion, up 2% from last year's $1.57 billion. Operating income was $137 million, flat from the $137 million a year ago and operating margin was pressured, coming in at 8.5%, down from 8.7% last year. Revenue was up thanks to higher average daily shipments.Turning to the Ground segment revenues increased markedly, coming in at $4.29 billion, up 20% from last year's $3.57 billion. Operating income was up as well to $656 million, from $603 million a year ago. Interestingly margins were pressured, as one might guess from the big rise in revenues but moderate rise in operating income. Operating margin was 15.3%, down from 16.9% the previous year. Revenues did rise on higher volume and pricing but operating results were negatively impacted by higher costs.The Express segment was relatively flat year-over-year on a revenue basis, but operating income and margins were stronger than last year. Revenue was $6.72 billion, flat from last year's $6.70 billion. However thanks to strong expense management as well as fuel and currency exchange positive impacts, operating income rose 27% to $757 million from $598 million a year ago. Further, operating margin jumped to 11.3%, up from 8.4% last year.These results are strong. Thanks to the buyback continued benefits to earnings per share should continue, as over the year the company bought back 18.2 million shares of FedEx common stock. The more shares repurchased the higher earnings will be. Looking ahead to 2017 FedEx expects moderate economic growth but hinted a precise estimate of sales and earnings is tough. That said the company set its adjusted earnings forecast to $11.75 to $12.25 per share with capital spending of $5.1 billion. This is a guidance in my opinion though it was considered light by some and the stock sold off. With a buyback and higher dividend, as well as continued strong growth, I like the name long-term. Still I would wait for a pullback under $150.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

3972151,70035,2016-05-06T00:10:00-04:00,"FedEx’s price target and stock rating has received an Overweight rating by Barclays, which indicate that this bank among others indicates that investors should buy.FedEx has adapted well to a growing demand for e-commerce.FedEx is working on cutting back on overcapacity and is innovating with more automation.Stock analysts are overwhelmingly positive on FedEx, and investors should be as well.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) may have felt like an old company consigned to the dustbin of history, but things have changed. The company has slimmed down, is more aggressive on the margins, and is finally taking steps to address the overcapacity problem, which has burdened it for years.And a big reward came on Wednesday. Barclays announced that it was upgrading FedEx's rating to Overweight and raised the stock's price target from $175 to $205. The company has maneuvered itself so that it is in prime position to take advantage of the rise in e-commerce, and its revenue growth has been strong. Barron's in the meantime has stated that FedEx's stock could jump from its current value of $163 to as much as $195 by the end of the year.Other analysts are even more optimistic, projecting that the stock price has a 28 percent upside potential from its closing price on Thursday. That's based on growth estimates of 13.21% over the next five years.Investors may be surprised to see how FedEx has managed to turn itself around. But that should not stop them from jumping on this stock and getting a chance to watch an old company readily adapt to a new, e-commerce world.The importance of e-commerceSo how has FedEx adjusted? As noted above, much of this growth has come on the back of e-commerce. In 2015, the Department of Commerce noted growth in e-commerce fueled more than half of all retail growth for that year. While total retail sales grew by 1.4 percent in 2015, e-commerce sales grew by 14.6 percent.FedEx is taking advantage of this growth to increase its revenue by shipping e-commerce goods through FedEx Ground. The company's net income is not what might be expected, but FedEx is still expected to grow well as it increases its e-commerce shipping volume and makes acquisitions. This includes acquiring the Holland-based carrier TNT Express, which passed significant regulatory hurdles with China on Monday.The other thing, which FedEx has finally managed to bring under control is its overcapacity in its Express business, which offers services to companies like Highya.com. While FedEx Express was once a key component, growing demand for ground transport over air service as well as years of sluggish economic growth had left Express having significant overcapacity for years.But FedEx has slashed airline flights to Asia, removed trucks, and is working on creating a leaner, more efficient shipping fleet. This has kept expenses down. And despite the rising demand in e-commerce, FedEx is preparing to lower its spending on FedEx Ground. This is because FedEx is increasing automation and is confident that technology can lower costs all while ensuring it can match increased demand.Looking good - but some concernsAll of this means that other firms beyond Barclay's are portending a good year for FedEx. Among other banks, UBS, Credit Suisse, and Citigroup have all moved FedEx's price target to at least $180 by the end of the year. Out of 27 analysts covering FedEx, none of them recommend selling the stock, and 15 recommend FedEx as either a ""Buy"" or a ""Strong Buy.""But there are some concerns. FedEx's growth has been bolstered by lower fuel costs. But while oil prices hit a low earlier this year, it appears that the price will increase to some degree by the end of the year. Armin Shah from The Street declared FedEx will not be hurt by a step-up in oil prices, and in fact, the low fuel prices also reduce FedEx's fuel surcharges, cutting into its profits.And while FedEx Ground and its e-commerce unit is going strong, the same cannot be said for FedEx Freight. FedEx Freight had a disappointing 2016 1Q, as it saw its operating income fall off, and it is heavily dependent on an uncertain American manufacturing sector. However, these small downsides should not make up for the company's overall upsides.Buy todaySo what should be the final word for investors? FedEx is not a stock, which you should invest in if you are aiming to sell it off in a few days to weeks. While the stock's value has elevated recently, inconsistencies in the market mean that there are bolder options over the short term.FedEx's strength is that as long as the global economy stabilizes and e-commerce continues to thrive, this is a stock, which will continue to appreciate over the long term. If Barclays' predictions prove to be accurate, investors could see FedEx's value increase by over 20 percent by the end of the year.There is no reason why long investors should wait. FedEx's stock will continue to increase in value over the next months, and investors should get onto this as soon as they can."
3968190,98056,2016-04-26T15:46:39-04:00,Operating margins show that FedEx is getting more efficient in core segments.This is a critical journey they need to continue on to make sure they can effectively stand up to the pressure put on them by UPS.What more does FedEx need to achieve ahead of the TNT acquisition to put themselves on more equal footing with UPS?,"Of the two transportation and logistics stocks - UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) - FedEx has been lagging behind the former on several fronts for a long time. Though the revenue gap has been narrowing every year and could easily vanish after the dust settles from FedEx's acquisition of TNT (OTCPK:TNTEY), there is still lot more that FedEx needs to achieve before it can give UPS a run for their money.A quick look at their operating margins is one of the biggest clues to how the product mix and operational efficiency of UPS has pushed them into a higher position than FedEx in the pecking order.FedEx's operating margins over the past few years tells a story in itself. Since 2007, they've found it extremely hard keeping that metric within the 6-8% level. On the other hand, UPS has almost never been below the 8% level in the same period.Both companies are guilty of not being able to show any consistency with respect to operating margins, but the problem for FedEx right now is that you can easily send one of their trucks through the yawning gap between their numbers vis-à-vis UPS. UPS has been easily topping 10% margins, while FedEx hasn't managed to breach that level in the past 10 years.The ProblemThe real issue with margins arises from the fact that FedEx's core revenues primarily come from the Express segment, which is low-margin by nature. On the other hand, UPS's primary volume goes through ground-express hybrid networks that are basically more efficient.According to Morningstar:Another major difference underlines why UPS is more efficient than FedEx: while the latter uses separate networks of trucks to deliver Express and ground parcels, UPS has already integrated the two - so, the same delivery network is used for both Express as well as ground shipments. Granted, FedEx's system gives customers the benefit of variable cost during high-volume periods, but that's only at peak times. The system UPS has in place makes it convenient for clients because the same driver and the same truck are used for both ground and Express delivery.The margin problem highlighted by Morningstar's analyst is a very real one, and FedEx has been trying to rectify that problem over the past few years. In fact, they've had a fair amount of success, but there's still a long way to go. Nearly 57% of their overall sales volume of $47.5 billion in 2015 came from the Express segment. As such, their margins are still dependent on this volatile segment. Integration with ground will take time, but that's the direction they need to go.FedEx Express margins have been slowly rising in the last three years, thanks to FedEx for aggressively focusing on reducing costs and improving efficiency. Their efforts are slowly starting to pay off, and this is extremely crucial for the company to shore up the bottom line as they move forward to the next round of their battle with UPS.During the first nine months of FY 2016, FedEX Express reported revenues of $19.736 billion with an operating income of $1.762 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 8.93%, a full 2.78% higher than the margin reported during the same period last year. This is the highest margin reported ever by the Express segment, which still accounts for more than 50% of their total sales.Investor-speak: The Outlook and the (Non-)ThreatGreat news from their earnings call, but FedEx can't afford to sit on those laurels. Even if they do grow efficiencies within segments, their overall operating margins are still a long way from those that UPS keeps putting out quarter after quarter. They need to be moving more volume through their high-margin segment, Ground, while gradually increasing efficiency on Express shipments the way UPS has been doing.On a side note, the threat to FedEx and UPS from e-commerce players encroaching on their volumes has been exaggerated. I've covered this in one of my earlier articles titled Amazon's Pursuit of Shipping Excellence where I called it "" imaginative speculation.""I now offer up my comments from that article so you can compare it with what Fred Smith is saying…Shudeep Chandrasekhar:Fred Smith, Chairman, FedEx:While I agree with the ""foreseeable future"" part, it's not a stretch to assume that Amazon is continuing to improve its competencies in areas that most affect customer experience - and that includes timely delivery at the lowest possible cost. The long-term effects of that cannot be foretold, but suffice it to say that, for now, FedEx and its key competitor in the United States are going to benefit more from the growth of e-commerce than be affected by a customer in that segment becoming a potential competitor.On that note, I would recommend investing not only in the more efficient and continually improving FedEx, but also the efficiency leader, UPS. This duopoly is here to stay, and both stocks can only grow stronger from here.FDX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts"
3980386,24276,2016-06-07T08:48:46-04:00,"FedEx seems to be making a turn from growth stock to yield stock.The dividend has been doubled since early 2015.The new rate is highly sustainable, and the stock could pop after earnings.","For most of the last decade, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has paid back its shareholders with capital gains. Since the bottom of the Great Recession, in early 2009, the shares are up 370%.But since early 2015, as the stock has run out of running room (and it is down about 10% from those levels), management has changed course. Slowly, FedEx is becoming a yield stock.That's not yet the case, even with yesterday's announcement that the dividend will be hiked to 40 cents/share, from 25 cents, early next month. That is twice the dividend that was being paid early in 2015.Be warned, however, that even at the 40 cent level, you're looking at a yield of 1% at current prices. There was no reaction to the news in the market.But the new rate is very affordable. The company reported earnings of $692 million, $2.51/share, for the March quarter, and TNT Express, whose acquisition recently went final, would have added 6 cents more. The company suffered a loss during the last quarter of 2015, tied to how it accounted for pensions, but that was a one-time thing and the books are now cleaner.Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.28/share for the May quarter, which will be reported on June 20, on revenue of $12.77 billion. If it can keep up that pace for a full year that's a forward Price/Earnings multiple of about 13 while last year's fourth-quarter loss has it listed at 40.The performance of FDX's stock has been dramatically weaker over the last year than that of rival UPS (NYSE:UPS). Overall, UPS is up 3% while FDX is down 10%. UPS was helped by the annual seasonal bump of Christmas, during which its revenue was up 10% from normal, but the numbers are now back in line with last year. Margins are fatter at UPS, but those at FDX are now expected to catch up if the analysts are right on the earnings.There is no guarantee that FDX will continue to raise its dividend, but UPS has already undergone the transition from growth to yield, and its 78 cent/share dividend now yields 3%. If FDX follows suit over the next few years, continuing to increase the dividend in a sustainable way, you should get a pop in both directions, on the stock price and in what you're being paid to own it."

(NYSE:FDX), the Memphis-based transportation and package delivery giant, reports its fiscal Q4 '16 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, June 21, 2016.Here is the current consensus for Q4 '16, Q1 '17 and full-year 2017 per Thomson Reuters:Source: Thomson Reuters consensusThe reason for the sharp increase in 2017 revenue is that the FedEx Corp's TNT acquisition closed in late May, 2016, and is now built into the 2017 revenue consensus.From what I read on FDX's TNT acquisition, the company gives FedEx a significant footprint in Europe but the margins might be the sticky issue with the company.A brief history: since late 2013, FedEx has benefited first from the giant share repurchase announcement which has effectively reduced FDX's fully-diluted shares outstanding from 319 million in November, 2013 to February '16's 275 million.That is a 13% - 14% reduction in shares outstanding.In addition, as readers well know, with the price of crude oil falling from over $100 in September '14 to the first quarter's low of $28, jet fuel prices came down significantly for FedEx: ""fuel expense"" for the FedEx Corp's P/L came down from $1.1 billion as of May '14 to $537 million at Feb '16, which is a 54% decline in just 7 quarters.What is fascinating to me is that if we look at ""4-quarter trailing"" operating income, almost the entire gain in operating income for FedEx Corp. has been from lower fuel expense.Finally, after years of FedEx Express showing slowing volumes, narrowing margins and slower growth, since late 2012, early 2013, Express has really turned the corner in terms of profitability, with Express now nearing a 10% operating margin, after management reduced Express expenses from a consistent $6.5 billion run rate to last quarter's $5.9 billion.The point of this brief summary is that the three tailwinds: Financial (share repurchases), crude oil, and Express expense reduction might have run their course, certainly, with crude oil up nearly 80% since its February '16 low of $28, to near $50 per barrel, that tailwind is diminished.The Future: the TNT could have been a timely acquisition. With the closing of the TNT deal, consensus revenue estimates for FedEx Corp increased $5 - $7 billion in fiscal '17 - '18, but the sticking point could be the margin's that FDX is able to extract from current TNT operations.In addition, with last quarter's earnings preview, the continued encroachment of Amazon on the ""last mile"" of the consumer (package delivery), FedEx management termed the concern, ""fantastical"" meaning they give little credence to Uber/Lyft/Amazon as a competitive threat. FedEx did say on the last call that no single customer accounts for more than 3% of FDX's revenue, which does help assuage any worry over the numerous Amazon trucks I see scurrying around the north side of Chicago.The Valuation:A forward earnings-based model I use values FDX closer to $200 per share, and combined with Morningstar's intrinsic value estimate of $173, (splitting the difference) with FDX trading near $160 today, the stock is trading at roughly a 15% discount to perceived fair value, using a couple of traditional models.However, using Finbox's valuation card, you could make a case that FedEx is 20% overvalued:Source: Finbox.ioWhen faced with such divergent views on a stock, I take a look at the forward EPS and revenue estimates, and for FDX, the 3-year ""average"" EPS and revenue growth - per the consensus estimates - shows the Street expecting 8% EPS and 9% revenue growth (includes TNT) with some possible additional earnings growth coming from expense reduction at TNT.Trading at 12(x) - 13(x) those forward earnings and 8(x) cash-flow, neither of which indicates FedEx Corp. is a screaming buy or sell.Between the two valuation extremes (and FDX is currently trading right in the middle of the two extremes), I do think FDX is more probably more undervalued than overvalued today, but the catalysts might not be as obvious with the share repurchase and the jet fuel savings dissipating.The recent substantial increase in the dividend for FedEx could mean several things for the freight giant. I'm a big believer, management communicates forward expectations via dividend changes. Here is what this increase in the dividend from $1 per year to $1.60 per year, could portend for the freight giant:1.) FedEx share repurchases - in terms of ASR (accelerated share repurchases) and substantial increases - are over, and management will return more capital to shareholders via the dividend than repurchases.2.) Cash-flow will improve sharply, which is somewhat questionable given that a business like FDX, which has a substantial global transportation footprint, and a high degree of operating leverage, can see sharp swings in operating cash-flow based on global economic changes.3.) FedEx is becoming a slower-growth, ""cash-cow"" type of a business for the next 3 - 5 years and management is trying to placate shareholders with dividend yield rather than faster earnings growth. Increased dividends can indicate that management thinks returning capital to shareholders is a better deal for shareholders since management cannot find opportunities in which to reinvest that capital. Is that the case for FedEx Corp ?Conclusion: FedEx Corp. has done a tremendous job the last few years driving operating improvement at Express, improving margins and yields, as well as utilizing substantial share repurchases and taking advantage of falling fuel prices to improve earnings and cash-flow.The issue is, these tailwinds are now in the rear-view mirror, as FedEx Corp. looks to drive margin growth at TNT in Europe, no easy feat given the regulation around employment throughout Europe.The next potential strong catalyst for the stock would be a return to synchronized global growth across the globe, which is something we've been waiting on since 2009, without much success.To be brutally honest with readers, I don't have a good feel for FedEx Corp. in terms of the stock being a screaming buy or sell at these levels. The stock at its current price looks to be a ""tweener"" and will increase with annual EPS and revenue growth, but might see fewer tailwinds in the weeks and months ahead.A trade back down to the $125 - $130 level, would get me very interested again in FDX. Clients do not have a big position in the stock currently - my expectations for a ""return to global growth"" never really materialized over the last few years."

3963238,52612,2016-04-05T10:37:26-04:00,"FedEx has had lackluster revenue growth in most recent years with its delivery business, while e-commerce transactions are setting no limits as to how far they can reach.Amazon's building of its own delivery network almost serves as an indictment of FedEx's inability to best serve up the logistics needs of online merchants.Having failed to land more of Amazon's business is a loss of the best opportunity for FedEx and will weaken its growth potential going forward.","FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) was supposed to benefit the most from ongoing e-commerce developments as it could take this opportunity to really build up its relatively low-profile package delivery business and potentially see above-average growth. The argument was made here back in December 2013, when the company finished the year with just a 3% revenue growth. For the next two years, however, the company's revenue growth stuck between 2 and 4%, while e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was advancing in sales at 20% in each of the same two years. It doesn't seem that FedEx kept up with the progress of e-commerce and really delivered for online merchants.It's not a surprise that Amazon has decided to take full control of its package delivery operation by flying a fleet of 20 freighters itself. The Air Express business within FedEx is the largest in the world and supposedly the best. But somehow it never really landed at Amazon. With Amazon operating its own freighters, FedEx is actually not getting a new competitor as some have suggested, but rather is losing a valuable business that it should have retained. In defense, FedEx stated no single customer accounts for more than 3% of the company's revenue, suggesting any lost revenue from Amazon wouldn't be a big deal. But FedEx should have expected itself to generate far more revenue from Amazon in the first place.Amazon had sales of over $100 billion in 2015, growing from less than $50 billion five years ago. FedEx was actually not too far behind with its sales just under $50 billion, which could give it the needed capacity to run a total delivery operation for Amazon. A 10% cut in delivery charge from Amazon's sales would have given FedEx about $10 billion in revenue from one single customer, considering that Amazon used almost 98% of its sales in 2015 to cover various operating expenses. The $10 billion would be close to 20% of FedEx's total revenue in 2015, compared to the per-customer revenue rate of a meager 3% currently. The loss of potential sales of that magnitude is indicative of how FedEx has not really revved up its business.It's evident that FedEx has also had a cost control issue. Both operating income and net earnings declined in the last two years even as revenue inched higher. The company has been working on a $1.7 billion, multi-year cost reduction plan in an attempt to boost earnings. However, a lasting solution to bottom line improvement eventually has to come down from top line growth. Because of the lost opportunity to generate sizable sales from Amazon, it's difficult to speculate where else FedEx can get meaningful revenue growth from customers the size of Amazon. It's certain, however, that the reported constant dialogue between FedEx and Amazon didn't produce a delivery partnership to the benefit of FedEx.The news about Amazon building its own air delivery network is not necessarily a telling of any direct threat to the delivery industry, as Amazon has no intention to become a dedicated logistics company, except that it will certainly serve third parties that sell merchandises on the Amazon Website. But the pronouncement is rather a revelation of how unimpressive companies like FedEx may have been in serving up the logistics needs of online merchants. The results are an unsatisfied Amazon about the status of its delivery and potentially disappointing shareholders of FedEx, which never pursued a business route of custom-designing delivery networks for large customer accounts like Amazon."

TNT will give FedEx a new source of revenue and cost-reducing synergies. It will allow FedEx to grow in Europe, South America, Asia, the Middle East and Australia. The acquisition makes FedEx more attractive as an investment. I like the valuation and growth prospects.FedEx got a good deal with the TNT Express acquisition in my opinion. FedEx paid $4.9 billion for the company that generates over $7 billion in revenue per year. That $7 billion in additional revenue represents about 13% of FedEx's expected FY17 revenue of $53 billion.FedEx is buying TNT for a price to sales ratio of 0.64, which is lower than FedEx's price to sales ratio of 0.89. This is also lower than United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) price to sales of 1.5. So, I think FedEx is getting TNT at an attractive valuation.FedEx will allow TNT to operate more efficiently. TNT currently has high operating expenses (94% of 2015 revenue), which led the company to have negative EPS over the past few years. However, I think the synergies from the acquisition will allow TNT to operate more profitably in the future. TNT and FedEx will benefit from operational efficiencies through improved pickup/delivery route optimization as a result of the acquisition. For example, overlapping shipping hubs and route coverage can be minimized and eliminated over time.One of the key things that FedEx is getting from the acquisition is TNT's customers. TNT has established customer relationships. FedEx can leverage its shipping expertise to maximize value to those customers. FedEx will benefit from an ongoing new source of revenue from those customers.Prior to the acquisition, FedEx had only 5% market share in Europe. Now that the company owns TNT, the market share in Europe is expected to rise to about 22%. This will place FedEx just behind UPS's 25% market share in Europe. Therefore, FedEx and UPS will have more of a level playing field in Europe.FedEx Valued Better than UPSData source: Yahoo! FinanceIf you don't mind a low dividend of less than 1%, then FedEx looks like the better investment. What the company doesn't pay in dividends should be compensated for in price appreciation due to its lower valuation and higher expected earnings growth. If you do like dividends, then UPS might be the more attractive investment as the stock yields 3%. All told, I expect FedEx's stock to outperform UPS due to its lower valuation, higher earnings growth and tailwinds from the TNT acquisition.FedEx is also valued lower than the broader market. The S&P 500 is trading at 17X next year's earnings, while FedEx is trading 24% lower with a forward P/E of only 13. Since the S&P 500 is expected to grow earnings at about 12% next year as compared to FedEx's 13% to 14% expected EPS growth, I expect FedEx to outperform due to a better valuation and superior growth.Possible HeadwindsThe industry has benefited from lower fuel prices over the past two years. The recent rise in oil prices from the upper $20s to the upper $40s has investors wondering if the low fuel price tailwinds are ending. An unexpected rise in oil prices due to unexpected events such as supply constraints or increased demand could create extra fuel costs for FedEx.The good news is that oil prices are still low as compared to the $90 to $100 range from a few years ago. The EIA is projecting oil prices to average $41/b in 2016 and $51/b in 2017. The supply of oil remains plentiful with OPEC maintaining production levels, and with Iran about to produce oil at pre-sanction levels as early as June. So, unless some unexpected event causes a disruption of the supply or we see an unexpected large jump in global demand, the price of oil is likely to remain near current levels. If something unexpected does happen, FedEx could face increased costs, leading to narrower profit margins associated with higher fuel prices.FedEx is also sensitive to the state of the economy. If a significant slowdown or recession occurs, the company is likely to experience a significant drop in the need for its deliveries. I don't see a recession happening any time soon, but investors should be aware that the stock is likely to fall more than the market as a result of a recession.ConclusionIf oil prices remain tame as expected, then FedEx will avoid fuel costs that could negatively affect its business. The economy is showing signs of incremental improvement as U.S. GDP has been positive for the past eight quarters. Since the Federal Reserve is taking its time raising interest rates, it is likely to take a while for rates to get to a level that would lead to a recession. Therefore, I think there is a low probability of the possible headwinds that I mentioned occurring within the next year.The TNT Express acquisition strengthens FedEx's global presence and increases its market share. FedEx will benefit from the new source of revenue and lower costs due to synergies. Overall, FedEx's attractive valuation and strong earnings growth is likely to drive the stock to outperform UPS's stock and the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future. The stock looks ripe for the picking due to valuation, growth, and because it moved above the 50-day moving average, showing strength."
3968146,99406,2016-04-26T15:05:41-04:00,How does FedEx stack up to UPS?The pending TNT merger appears on track.Does TNT offer cost synergies or just room for growth in the right markets?,"IntroductionAfter taking a look at UPS (NYSE:UPS), their moat, core business, and how they stand up in a fight against the gorilla that is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I decided to take a look at their most direct competitor here in the land of fried chicken and beer, FedEx (NYSE:FDX).Similar to UPS in many respects, FedEx is a transportation company that handles small packages, freight, express shipments, air, and more. They also have a service aspect in that they offer logistics solutions, software, and backend stuff involved with that.Let's start with everyone's favorite part, the financials, and go from there.2015 FinancialsWhen I look at FedEx's financials for 2015 at a high level I notice a couple things. One is that most of the financials are distorted by a change in their pension accounting. This has depressed all sorts of figures whether it is net income, EPS, etc.The company provides adjusted metrics that, of course, make everything seem down right amazing after you adjust out that change along with other ones.The pension change was essentially that they are ""marking to market"" actuarial gains and losses in the year they occur instead of spreading out or amortizing them of a timeframe. Savvy readers may remember mark to market accounting was one of the many factors involved in the financial crisis. Not that it causes it, it did not, but that the government allowed the banks to stop using this accounting for their bonds and other junky securities like MBS on their books.This allowed them to hold these items on their books at values substantially above what they were actually trading for--supposedly what they would go for in a ""normal"" market.While I am by no means an expert on these type of issues, it looks like the change had little effect on 2014 results while lowering 2015 net income substantially and boosting 2013 net income.The other charges they want to adjust out are costs and impairment associated with retiring 10 aircraft and increased legal fees. These totaled $276 million pre tax and $197 million pre tax.In my analysis I am NOT going to adjust these as I feel these are much more normal expenses in the course of business then the accounting adjustment mentioned above. It is my hope that this will bring us to a much more realistic evaluation for what the company's true earning power is going forward.Revenues were up 4%, hurt somewhat by currencies as can be expected. Debt was up a massive 53%. Net income and operating income were all down, but were actually slightly up in my view as I will talk more about below.Shareholder equity fell which is always a sign that value is being lost somewhere along the way and should be something to watch closely after the TNT and other acquisitions the company has announced and made recently.Shareholder equity has a way of showing whether mergers and acquisitions were truly worth the price as large restructuring expenses and goodwill impairments have a way of wiping that out quickly with nary a word over possible overpayment being spoken by management.ExpensesNot counting the pension accounting adjustment, total operating expenses were up ~$2 billion year over year. An interesting note I found is that the company expects interest expense to be $320 to $325 million for the next few years, up from $235 million in 2015.This does not include any additional debt that has to be issued to fund the TNT acquisition which may have been funded since the 2015 annual report was issued or still has to be.This does not sound like a large expense in the grand scheme of things but when a company has net income of $2-3 billion a $100 million increase in interest expense is definitely material.My adjusted net income for 2015 was $2.442 billion versus $2.324 billion in 2014. I got this number by using all the companies figures expect the pension shenanigans and hey using last years tax rate of ~36% to get the net income figure.While I do not suggest that this is what the company earned in 2015, because it is not and the accounting police will soon swoop down to tell you as much, I use this number to determine their ""earning power"" and is useful to be trying to project out the company progress years down the line.My opinion on FedEx's 2015 was that it was just OK. Revenues up 4% were nice but nothing extraordinary. I think if fuel prices were at levels they were in 2014 & 2013 then net income would have been flat to just barely increased after we filter out all the junk I mentioned above.Expenses appear to be increasing in line with revenue if not slightly faster. FedEx new planes should bring those figures down some, but if jet fuel surges back up those costs might cancel each other out for next year.Share repurchasesThe company purchased $1.3 billion worth of shares in 2015, down from a massive $4.9 billion in 2014. The shares repurchased in 2015 added .14 to diluted EPS, which is not as high as it should have been because of the cost of the debt used to purchase part of the shares.If you have read any of my articles or looked at any company results in the past few years you will notice this is a pattern among many, many companies. I am not sure what the long term implications are of this massive borrowing of money to buyback shares, but it could hamper growth in the future or perhaps it is part of the cause for the slow growth now.If the free money central banks are handy out is not being used to, you know, grow the economy, which is their purposed intent, then should we be surprised that the economy around the globe is stuck in neutral?The TNT FedEx MergerIn late 2015 FedEx announced they planned to merger with TNT, one of the leading shipping companies in Europe. The interesting twist is that UPS already tried this maneuver a few years earlier and failed, but it appears FedEx may well succeed as they have already got approval from the U.S. and most importantly the EU.This transaction should put FedEx at 22% market share in Europe versus UPS' 25%. While Europe is not the most exciting or fast growing market in the world, it does seem like a good acquisition at first glance.I question how much costs will actually be able to be cut as FedEx will not get to keep TNT's airforce due to regulatory concerns and one of the reasons this merger even passes muster is because of FedEx's lackluster presence in Europe. The company touts synergies along carrying routes and with sorting facilities, but I think the real advantage will come in Asia and China were the combined company will have better scale to battle for share in the world's fastest growing economy.The one clear positive I see is that this does help FedEx use some of its overseas cash that they were not intent on bringing back to the U.S. That figure stood at just over $500 million according to the 2015 10k.At the end of the day, there is no way to know but to find out. As I mentioned above, keep an eye out of shareholder equity and future quarters for restructuring charges and other one time charges the company takes as it attempts to improve the cost structure after the acquisition closes in late 2016.Dividend GrowthFedEx currently yields a low .60% with a 5 year dividend growth rate of 15.81% and a payout ratio of 28%. UPS' payout ratio is 58% so it is not unreasonable that dividend growth can climb even if it means pushing this payout ratio higher, but many expect that the TNT acquisition will require more capex in the future as the company has under invested ever since the failed UPS buyout a few years ago.FDX Dividend data by YChartsI wouldn't expect huge increases going forward as it appears the company greatly prefers buybacks as their preferred method of capital allocation to shareholders.ValuationThe stock trades at ~15 times current year estimates and 13.5 times 2017 estimates, which at 12.15 EPS, look a bit ridiculous to me and will likely be revised downward.FDX data by YChartsPrice to Cash flow is 12.96 and PEG 3.58. Price to sales is .93 TTM.UPS is priced much higher on all these metrics and has a much higher yield.It is hard to price FedEx here other than to say it looks fairly price, given that most of the transports like airlines and railroads are priced below where it is and only UPS and a few others are above it.That being said these numbers are using the old projections after the major accounting change and it is likely that because of that they appear to low. 2016 numbers may soon reveal that FedEx is trading much closer to its American peer that it may seem from a cursory glance at Yahoo Finance.The growth profile appears lackluster depending upon the strength of the recent acquisitions which will take some time to play.Depending on your outlook and optimism for these and the global economic backdrop, FedEx may be priced just right below its 5 year average and many of its transport peers.ConclusionFedEx appears fairly valued but with the uncertainty of its large TNT acquisition looming. Debt has been increasing rapidly and will slightly hamper future growth unless a large amount of cost synergies are realized otherwise share buybacks of even greater portions will be needed to continue growing EPS at a similar rate to the past few years.I think given how similar the companies are, I might prefer UPS at the given moment simply due to the fact that less variables are involved in the company's story and therefore it is theoretically easier to predict and anticipate their results going forward."

The long-term appears bright.Let's take a closer look at some of the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamFedEx's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx (NYSE:FDX) provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. It was founded in 1971 and is based in Memphis.• We like the company's decision to acquire TNT Express, though the latter continues to struggle. FedEx will gain access to the firm's European distribution network, while TNT will be able to capitalize on FedEx's global one. Expected to close in the first half of 2016, it's a €4.4 billion deal.• An investment in FedEx is not without risks. The firm's operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities, and package-handling and sort equipment. Capital expenditures are generally 7%-9% of sales. FedEx ended the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 with ~$2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, however, a nice balance.• FedEx reported a solid third quarter in its fiscal 2016 thanks to volume growth in its Ground segment and operational improvements in its Express segment. Total revenue grew 8% on a year-over-year basis, while non-GAAP EPS jumped nearly 24% from the year-ago period. Legal matters tied to the Ground and Trade Networks weighed on GAAP results, however.• After the third quarter of fiscal 2016, management tightened its adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $10.70-$10.90 compared to the previous forecast of $10.40-$10.90. This guidance assumes moderate economic growth and ignores certain legal matters, as well as any costs or operating results related to the TNT merger. The new forecast range represents 20%-22% growth from fiscal 2015, and the positive financial momentum is expected to continue into fiscal 2017.• FedEx's long-term financial goals are as follows: 1) achieve 10% operating margin; 2) increase EPS 10%- 15% per year; 3) grow profitable revenue; 4) improve cash flows; 5) increase ROIC; 6) and increase the dividend. We like management's focus, especially on ROIC.• Global trade growth and e-commerce continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 15.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Companies that have strong economic profit spreads are often also solid free cash flow generators, which also lends itself to dividend strength. FedEx's Dividend Cushion ratio, a forward-looking measure that takes into account our projections for future free cash flows along with net cash on the balance sheet and dividends expected to be paid, is a tremendous 5.3 (anything above 1 is considered strong).Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 3.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At FedEx, cash flow from operations decreased about 7% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 12% over the same time period.Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, FedEx reported cash from operations of $3.8 billion and capital expenditures of just under $3.6 billion, resulting in free cash flow generation of more than $230 million. This is less than half of the free cash flow generated in the same period in fiscal 2015.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we package our valuation assumptions and ship them into a fair value estimate for shares.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx's shares are worth between $124-$186 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$163, in the upper half of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is more downside risk than upside potential associated with shares at this time.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $155 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 10.2%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $155 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $124 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $186 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $155 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $207 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $155 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpThere is plenty to like about FedEx. Global trade growth and e-commerce continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services, and we are encouraged by management's focus on long-term results, particularly in the area of ROIC. Recent financial momentum has been solid, and the firm is expecting it to continue into its fiscal 2017. The recent tightening of its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is a positive sign, but we would have liked to see better free cash flow performance thus far in the firm's fiscal year.We're big fans of FedEx's dividend safety based on its outstanding Dividend Cushion ratio of 5.3. The biggest restraint on the firm's dividend may very well be management's willingness to raise the quarterly payout. The looming merger with TNT does add a degree of uncertainty around this aspect of its business, but we like the deal, generally speaking.

3961367,26861,2016-03-28T11:59:06-04:00,"FedEx's valuation is below traditional levels, yet based on average analyst price targets, expectations look to remain near this level.The TNT Express deal may add moderate headwinds possibly reducing the company's margins and impacting earnings estimates.FedEx's results for the third quarter are a good indication that 2016 will continue to be a volume-growth year for package delivery and LTL freight markets.Based on today's price, long-term investors have an opportunity to buy into the company at a valuation below 16 times adjusted diluted EPS.FedEx is currently rated as a moderate buy/accumulate.","FedEx Corporation's (NYSE:FDX) stock price as of March 25, 2016 closed at $162.65/share. During 2016 and looking back, there were great opportunities to own the stock prior to the company's third-quarter earnings report. At around $144/share on the day of the earnings, investors still could have ended up making nearly 12 percent the next trading day.Source: Yahoo! FinanceBut this is now history and the important thing for investors to consider is FedEx's potential moving forward. Analysts are expecting the company to earn around $10.80/share on an adjusted basis. Additionally, analysts' forward stock price average targets are around $175/share. This means that based on today's price, investors could expect to earn around 7.5 percent over the next year; including the 1 percent dividend, this is an 8.5 percent return possibility, which is solid.FedEx has traditionally traded in the high teens to low 20s from a P/E ratio perspective over the past decade or so. But moving forward, I feel much more comfortable assuming a P/E in the 16-18 times earnings range. This matches current valuation expectations from analysts in the near term and gives some leeway in the event global economic conditions improve. But long term, I would not be expecting valuations much higher; if they do occur, these are signals to hold or trim positions due to competitive risks.Today's price does, however, provide an opportunity for solid gains, and investors could expect to see even greater gains during 2017 if the company continues on its path towards adjusted diluted earnings of $13/share. To this point, it is important for investors to consider the company's recent performance on a GAAP versus non-GAAP basis.Source: Company financials and personal databaseOver the past 19 quarters, FedEx has typically witnessed both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS performance to be fairly consistent. However, the previous five quarters have displayed the most substantial deviation between these two measures. This was most extreme during the 2015 fourth quarter; primarily a result from pension and aircraft impairment adjustments. The recent third quarter of 2016's deviation was primarily a result of legal matters and to a lesser extent, TNT Express (OTC:TNTEF) expenses.Regardless, analysts are basing their expectations on non-GAAP diluted EPS, so investors need to consider this measure as their primary focus. The other primary measure investors should consider is the company's EV/EBITDA. This measure has increased of late and trades significantly higher than the company's traditional levels. This is a result of slower growing EBITDA over the past 5-7 years.Once the TNT Express deal is finalized, investors should expect a continued deviation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures to occur more frequently in the near term. Investors need to have a comfort level with this type of situation. Additionally, TNT Express' margins for the most part have performed lower than FedEx recently. This will weigh on FedEx's margins post integration, which may lead the company to miss analyst targets.The third-quarter earnings report was highly positive due to FedEx's strong volume performance. The company's third quarter period includes December, January and February so FedEx is unique in that the company has two quarters back-to-back with exposure to holiday-shopping seasonality. But the majority of the third quarter includes most of the winter season so the volume growth is a good indication moving forward for the year.All package-based parts of the business witnessed volume growth led by the ground services segment. Growth in this segment continues to be driven strongly by both volume and yield. Domestic package delivery similarly witnessed moderate volume and yield growth, while international package delivery witnessed moderate volume growth, but declining yields due to continued foreign currency headwinds.Source: Company filings and personal database (shipments in thousands)For FedEx's freight segments, express tonnage declined nearly 3 percent while less-than-truckload, or LTL tonnage improved by over 4 percent. Express freight declines are indicative of air and truckload, or TL shipments and volumes have been much more flat over the past few years. The LTL segment's growth is good for FedEx as the company is the market leader by tonnage. It also bodes well for the industry as a whole which witnessed declining volume rates through the back-half of 2015.Source: Company financials and personal database (tonnage in thousands)The biggest discussion surrounding FedEx has been e-commerce and Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) foray into air freight through its new contract with Air Transport Services (NASDAQ:ATSG). While this is an interesting new business venture, it does not change anything at the moment. Amazon also relies upon Progistics and many other smaller last-mile delivery transportation companies in addition to FedEx and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).Amazon may end up buying out Air Transport and/or Progistics over time if these models meet Amazon's delivery and service expectations. This, of course, would possibly eliminate cost, while at the same time add new revenue and earnings based on these companies' business models. Air Transport is profitable with major customers including Deutsche Post AG (OTCPK:DPSGY) and the U.S. military. Progistics has large customers including Ryder System (NYSE:R), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW), and YRC Worldwide (NASDAQ:YRCW), just to name a few.Other speculative suggestions are that companies, including Uship, Uber (NYSE:UBER), etc., may be able to use marketplace platforms to match shippers with customers. This is the most unclear possible threat over the long term and least impactful threat over the near term.For these reasons, it is good for investors to consider FedEx's valuation in the 16-18 times earnings range. FedEx is in a good position to meet the company's fiscal year 2016 year-end estimate of $10.80/share. Based on this, investors could expect to see a return of 8.5 percent over the next 12 months (including the dividend payout), and as such is rated as a moderate buy/accumulate."
3959309,22148,2016-03-17T14:11:14-04:00,FedEx smashed FQ3 estimates on solid volumes and higher margins.The stock sold off on unwarranted expectations that Amazon could somehow disrupt the delivery sector so quickly.The stock is a bargain at the current valuation based on historical prices.,"Despite ongoing worries about a future entrant into the delivery sector, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) continues to produce solid results that aren't impacted by competitive threats. The stock price though suggests a big impact is on the way from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Based on updated FY16 guidance along with strong FQ3 numbers, FedEx bounced 5% after hours to nearly $152. The stock though trades far below the highs of last year at $185 for a company that generated EPS growth of over 20%. One has to wonder if FedEx isn't now a bargain.FedEx easily smashed Q4 estimates that were somewhat of a surprise considering a pattern of missing estimates lately. The question though will persist on whether the company can match growth expectations for FY17 and beyond.Regardless of what the company says, the biggest lurking concern is Amazon. FedEx tried to brush off the online retailer's purchase of 20 airplanes as more of a move to manage inventory levels between distribution hubs and facilities. But either way Amazon shows an increasing interest of delivering packages directly to customers via drones or other methods.FedEx is correct in that Amazon can't match the delivery facilities and route/stop density of the top delivery services of FedEx, UPS (NYSE:UPS) and the U.S. Postal Service. What the company misses is that history is littered with companies stuck with the costs of a vast network providing access to all while an upstart competitor is able to cherry pick the most profitable routes, customers and service options.For now, the statement by Chairman Fred Smith during the earnings call stands as the logical takeaway:Due to the fact that fears of an Amazon disruption are misguided for now, FedEx offers an extreme value in comparison to the last five years. Over the course of that extended period, the stock was worth snapping up when the forward PE ratio dipped to current levels.FDX data by YChartsThe prime reason that FedEx smashed FQ3 results were strong operating margins that surged from only 8.3% last year to 9.2% this year. The higher margins follow a pattern of the last couple of years and might provide a hint as to why Amazon continues to making moves toward delivering packages directly to customers.Source: FedEx presentationWith a target of achieving operating margins in excess of 10%, investors will want to keep an eye on this number going forward. Weaker margins could provide the first indication of an impact from Amazon. Though at this point the company suggests it doesn't have any customer including Amazon that accounts for more than 3% of business.The key takeaway is that any fears over Amazon disrupting the delivery business are fantastical at this point. Buying any dips remains a smart move until a sign emerges that Amazon is indeed disrupting the sector."
3959147,24103,2016-03-17T05:16:55-04:00,,"On yesterday's earnings call, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) executive Mike Glenn dismissed rumors that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) might be preparing to create a serious competitor to the ""big three"" shippers, saying that doing so would simply take too long and cost too much.Money quote below:In a note Tuesday, RBC discussed Amazon's attempts to build its own distribution network:The key challenge here is the disparity between Amazon's net sales growth and shipping expense growth, as witnessed in the chart below:Amazon has also experienced delivery delays during peak season, which appears to be the focus of FedEx's comments above that ""peak days are becoming a thing of the past.""Still, RBC agrees that given the costly and lengthy nature of building its own delivery chain, it's more likely Amazon will take a slower approach:"
3958763,32001,2016-03-15T23:35:21-04:00,"I am seeing more and more cars with Amazon two-hour delivery in the neighborhood.TNT Express is a big plus for FedEx in Europe, and puts its market share on par with that of UPS.What if the overnight small package business goes entirely to the Uber/Lyft entrepreneur?The PIP and drop in crude oil could be priced into the stock already.In the short term, the stock looks to be trading at a 15% discount to fair value.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports fiscal Q3 '16 financial results after the bell on Wednesday. Analyst consensus is looking for $2.34 in earnings per share on $12.4 billion in revenue, for expected year-over-year (y/y) growth of 25% and 6%, respectively, which isn't too shabby given the rest of the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).For fiscal '16 (ending May '16), Wall Street consensus is looking for $10.56 on $49.9 billion in revenue, for expected growth of 18% and 5%, respectively, while fiscal '17 is also expecting 13% and 5% growth, respectively.I don't know about you, but 5-6% revenue growth and 15-18% EPS growth over the next 15 months doesn't seem too bad to me.FDX (the stock) is down from $180 to $144 on what seems to be China worries, US economic growth worries, crude oil worries (which should be a big benefit to margins, assuming the surcharge was lowered or eliminated altogether), and yet, the numbers don't support the price action.So what gives?Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) January '16 announcement detailing the company's entry into the freight-forwarding market might have something to do with it, as this article details. I had to re-read it a couple of times to understand it, but the article also addresses what I am seeing anecdotally more and more: like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), more and more passenger cars are showing up around the neighborhood with Amazon delivery placards on the driver's door.The point of the article is that with the freight forwarding business, Amazon could control the customer delivery process from end to end.FedEx Ground has been a huge winner for FedEx since launching in 2000, with Ground revenue as a percentage of the company's revenue rising from very little to 33% as of the last quarter reported by FedEx, or November 2015.How do all these personal delivery cars NOT put a dent in the company's overnight delivery business eventually, particularly as Amazon now sells groceries? Granted, it could be a small concern right now, but so were PCs in the late 1970s and iPods in early 2000.Since the start of the year, the European Commission approved (supposedly unconditionally) the acquisition of TNT Express (a European freight company) by FedEx. I considered this a big positive for a capital-intensive business like FedEx, as it will own roughly a 25% market share (along with UPS) of the European delivery business. Scale is everything to capital-intensive businesses.That being said, FedEx has driven a recovery in FedEx Express, FDX's largest segment by revenue at over 50% of the company's total revenue. More importantly, thanks to the downsizing and offering early retirement to employees, the company has improved Express's margins, the best in nine quarters, per one Wall Street source.ValuationTrading at 14(x) earnings for expected 14% ""average"" EPS growth in the next 3 years, and 5% revenue growth on a PEG or GARP basis, FDX is relatively cheap.That being said, the big share repurchase announcement, along with the PIP (productivity improvement plan, or profit improvement plan, take your pick) and lower crude prices are huge catalysts that have run their course and, in my opinion, are embedded in the stock.FedEx's one worry is that free cash flow has been barely positive the last six quarters, which isn't a big concern, but I'd like to see the freight giant return to the free cash flow generation of $500 million to $1 billion it generated for years.ConclusionBoth Morningstar's fair value estimate and my own fair value model say FDX is trading at about a 15-18% discount to fair value, which is closer to $175-180.True, it is likely early in the game, but do you factor in Amazon as a China freight forwarder and as a two-hour delivery service for smaller packages?If and when FDX is played from the long side, I will likely do it using the iShares Transportation Average ETF (BATS:IYT), of which FDX is the largest component.The fact is that you can extrapolate the logic of an Amazon doing to ground freight what it did to the Cloud, but the logic can flow faster through the gray matter than the reality of Amazon putting a dent in the actual freight business.Technically, FDX is oversold on a weekly basis and is due for a bigger bounce than what we have probably seen since late February '16.A higher volume trade through $130-131, and the stock is likely broken."
3960299,46261,2016-03-22T15:51:06-04:00,"FedEx CEO is in a state of denial.Amazon's aim is not to take over the entire FedEx business.More likely, Amazon and others just want the most lucrative routes and FedEx's customers just want to lower their costs by destroying FedEx's margins.Given these threats and other factors mentioned in the article, FedEx's valuation is stretched.","Investment thesisFedEx's (NYSE:FDX) CEO is in a dangerous state of denial and is missing the point.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber (Private:UBER), Lyft (Private:LYFT) and other customers and competitors may not be able to chip away much of FedEx's sales this year. But that's not the point at all. The point is that they will slowly but surely and with increasing speed and effect keep stealing FedEx's most-lucrative routes and segments and aim at lowering delivery prices in order to negotiate better fees with FedEx. This will hurt FedEx's sales only a bit but it will absolutely destroy FedEx's margins.FedEx's CEO probably thinks Amazon wants to take over FedEx's entire business whereas in reality Amazon most likely just wants to destroy FedEx's margins to save money and take the most lucrative business (including its internal delivery business). Naturally, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) will be impacted as well.But new competition and margin pressure is not the only issue for FedEx. The current valuation of 15x forward non-GAAP adjusted earnings (that still ignores net debt) is a problem as well, especially in connection with the following factors:FedEx operates in an oligopoly with UPS and USPS in the U.S. and with DHL internationally. After the pending TNT Express (OTCPK:TNTEF) acquisition, its external growth opportunities will be very limited due to further mergers having a slim chance of being approved by antitrust regulators. So, the top-line growth is most probably peaking and there are very few new organic growth opportunities at the high ROI that FedEx's current business generates.Margins are most probably peaking as well. Profits have been rising much faster than top-line growth partly due to cost cutting. This margin expansion trend is clearly unsustainable. FedEx currently operates very close to the highest margins of the past decade and we are arguably, significantly closer to the top of the business cycle than to its bottom.FedEx is a very capital-intensive business with high-fixed costs. It even touts this as their major advantage. I see it as a weakness if the industry starts changing. FedEx's CEO correctly argues that no customer accounts for more than 3% of its sales, and it will take time and money for competitors to make a major dent in sales. But what the CEO is missing to mention is that even a small drop in sales will have an outsized impact on operating profits, due to the high operating leverage that works both ways as well as because of the negative product margin mix when the company loses the most lucrative business first.Given the cyclicality, strong operational leverage and at least some financial leverage - FedEx also is an excellent hedge of a long U.S. stock portfolio against a potential U.S. and global slowdown. In short, FedEx is a good short candidate in the long run, but may see some strength for one or two more quarters.High margins attract new entrants and FedEx's customers such as Amazon (planes, drones, driverless trucks), Uber/Lyft (cars)Even FedEx's CEO boasts of the high margins and advertises them to the entire world in case some competitor or customer missed the fact:This boasting about high margins is bound to keep motivating Amazon and other FedEx customers to build small, flexible networks of their own to service their most lucrative deliveries and put pressure on FedEx to negotiate better rates.Here is why I think FedEx's CEO is in a state of denialHistory is littered with lessons of CEOs underestimating competitors and the industry's potential fast-paced change. FedEx's CEO sees his industry in the narrow definition of competitors, considering only the big three that control 95% of the U.S. shipments, failing to see new entrants and, most importantly, to see its own customers as its competitors. So, while I agree with FedEx's CEO that it would take time and money to seriously take on FedEx, I believe the negative effects on FedEx will be stronger than what the CEO and the markets expect, and they also will happen sooner.I will debunk FedEx CEO's statement that it would take ""way too much time and money"" to take on FedEx. Time and money are totally irrelevant for some customers/competitors, such as Amazon. Here is why.The ""too much money"" argumentFirst, money is not an issue. We live (whether I like it or not) in an era of ZIRP and NIRP, where strong companies are flush with cash and are able to borrow even more - at almost no cost or issue - new shares at high valuations. In this ""funny money"" era, a startup like Uber can grow from nothing to a $62B valuation in five years.Moreover, it is not without interest that Amazon's Jeff Bezos participated in one of the earliest Uber funding rounds through his Bezos Expeditions. I see a clear connection there with the current Amazon's ventures into FedEx's territory via planes and drones.As a side note, Uber's current valuation is 30% higher than FedEx's. When Uber's valuation grows to $100B and Uber takes over FedEx with its stock, I believe that will be a clear sign of the peak of this bubble cycle, similar to AOL's takeover by Time Warner 15 years ago, at the dot.com bubble peak.The ""too much time"" argumentHow much time would it take, really, to hurt FedEx? If you have the money and use a leasing business model instead of building or owning the infrastructure and the fleet, the time drastically contracts. Plus, markets are always forward-looking. Even if competitors start chipping away at FedEx's most lucrative business very slowly, the markets will discount some of the erosion forward and this could mean weakness for FedEx's stock as soon as the current earnings euphoria fizzles and as soon as the TNT revenues are reflected in the numbers in several quarters from now.Amazon has always been focused on the long picture, so time does not matter for the company, as long as the investment makes sense in the very long run.The A-bomb scenario that would be absolutely toxic to FedExAmazon is known for taking a long-term view and not caring about margins at all in the short run. When Amazon just masters to take care of a majority of its own deliveries, this would hurt FedEx only to the tune of roughly 3% of sales and a bit more in margins. This sounds benign. However, what if Amazon drops the A-bomb and runs their delivery network at zero margins or even at a loss, significantly undercutting FedEx's margins - either with the goal of attracting new clients at the beginning, or simply because their goal may not be to take over FedEx's business, but to depress their margins to save on delivery costs paid to them? Something akin to what Google is doing with its Fiber business. Pushing existing providers to innovate and offer better and cheaper services. A similar move could push down FedEx and UPS margins on a majority of their business, not just Amazon's ~3% business with FedEx.Has Amazon ever not destroyed margins in a business it entered?Think about it. Is there a business that Amazon entered where margins have not dropped? Amazon is a poster example of zero-cost capital, a zero-margin model. This is going to destroy FedEx's (and UPS') high-margin, high-ROI model. While FedEx owns most of its fleet, Amazon is renting, making it much more flexible to scale up and down as needed. This is in line with the low-margin, low-risk, high scalability approach of Amazon. Unlike FedEx's fat margins, Amazon operates practically close to breakeven, so they don't provide such a strong incentive by competitors to take Amazon's share.My takeawayI believe FedEx's CEO is downplaying the threats facing the company. Amazon and other competitors will chip away at FedEx's attractive high-margin business, naturally attacking the most lucrative routes and segments first and aiming to lower FedEx's margins and their own costs. The capital-intensive FedEx will slowly, but surely, underperform. I'm bearish on FedEx in the long run, though I see one or two more quarters of strong results which will likely drive the stock price higher. I'm also bullish on Amazon in the long run, but the price is stretched."
3959297,33291,2016-03-17T13:41:47-04:00,I am initiating coverage on FedEx.A big statement from the company regarding competition from Amazon has reassured many.Fiscal Q3 earnings are out and I discuss the key metrics.There are many strengths but a few key soft spots to be aware of.,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) is a name I have yet to cover but after catching my eye following its statement that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) would not be a realistic competitor. You may recall that Amazon was potentially do have its own fleet of planes to up shipping and of course there was the idea of drones to make deliveries. But I agree with FedEx that it is not realistic that Amazon could develop this. It is not however impossible. That said, FedEx is holding its own and the stock has recovered all its losses in 2016. So I decided to take a look at the company's performance.The stock is a little pricey on a current p/e basis of 33 but I will say the growth is there. The company has just reported solid earnings. So how good are we talking? Well, revenue was $12.7 billion, rising 8.5% and beating estimates by $320 million. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $1.84 for the third quarter compared to $2.18 per diluted share last year. Of course we need to consider adjustments when comparing year-over-year and adjusted operating income rose 19% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings were $2.51 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share a year ago. This also beat expectations by $0.17.Why so good? The company has been watching expenses and has seen continued positive impacts from these profit improvement program initiatives. Let us not forget oil prices are a huge expense and the net impact of fuel was mitigated compared to last year helping to improve results. Of course with all of the international business currency exchange rates are an issue, but they helped improved results.Now, despite the overwhelming blowout of expectations there was some softness. There were weaker operating results at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. FedEx Freight Segment. The Freight segment reported revenue of $1.45 billion, up just 1% from last year's $1.43 billion. Operating income was $56 million, down 16% from $67 million a year ago and operating margin was pressured, coming in at 3.9%, down from 4.7% last year. Revenue was up thanks to higher average daily shipments but higher salaries and benefits weighed.Turning to the Ground segment revenues were way up, coming in at $4.41 billion, up 30% from last year's $3.39 billion. However, light the Freight segment operating income and margins were pressured. Operating income was $557 million, down from $559 million a year ago while operating margin was 12.6%, down from 16.5% the previous year. Revenues did rise on higher volume and pricing but operating results were negatively impacted by higher costs. Costs were driven significantly by network expansion and by demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations. This weighed heavily as did higher insurance costs.Interestingly the revenues in the Express segment declined, but operating income and margins were stronger than last year. Revenue was $6.56 billion, down 1% from last year's $6.66 billion. However thanks to strong expense management as well as fuel and currency exchange positive impacts, operating income rose 51% to $595 million from $393 million a year ago. Further, operating margin jumped to 9.1%, up from 5.9% last year.These results are strong. But it doesn't matter where the company has been it matters where it is going. In that regard, there should be continued benefits to earnings per share as during the present quarter, the company bought back 7.3 million shares of FedEx common stock. Share repurchases benefited the quarter's results by $0.07 per share this quarter. The more shares repurchased the higher earnings will be, which stands to reason. Looking ahead for the rest of the 2016 fiscal year FedEx narrowed its adjusted earnings forecast to $10.70 to $10.90 per share compared to the previous forecast of $10.40 to $10.90 per diluted share. This is a strong modification as the company believes it will come in at the highest end of the range.I like the results here and am impressed. I think the stock is a touch pricey and would wait for a pullback to do some buying. I also would like to see a higher dividend out of the company. That said, the company has pricing power, should see continued benefits of lower oil prices and the demand for shipping services continues to rise. I like the name long-term.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

3890956,100036,2016-02-12T03:10:23-05:00,Both companies performed in their most recent quarterly earnings call.UPS has wider margins and has executed during peak season.FedEx looking to expand to Europe and grow the business - but at what costs?,"Ford (NYSE:F) versus General Motors (NYSE:GM), Boeing (NYSE:BA) versus Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) versus Chevron (NYSE:CVX), there are many companies out there who go head-to-head in their respective industries leaving investors sometimes to wonder which stock is a better investment. With both FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service UPS both reporting respectable earnings in their most recent quarters and each growing year-over-year revenues, let's take a more detailed look at the two companies and see who should deliver better over the next year.First - a look at the past 12 months:UPSIn the brown corner we have (NYSE:UPS). Currently paying a 3.04% yield with a PE ratio of 18x, and an EPS of $5.35 this stock is about 10% off it's 52 week high of $107.32. Most recently UPS reported Q4 earnings with an EPS of $1.57, beating estimates by $0.15 with revenues of $16.05 billion which were a 0.9% year-over-year increase, but short $230 million of estimates. They issued FY2016 guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, a 5% to 9% increase (7% if you exclude tax credits).RiskWhile there were mixed reactions to the earnings call there is the looming concern that Amazon may (will) eventually take shipping into its own hands to some unknown degree as in Q3 of 2015 it spent over 11%, almost $3 billion, to get its products to customers. UPS's reliance on Amazon is not exactly known at this time, but there was an article in the Wall Street Journal in 2013 where analysts estimated approximately 30% of Amazon's packages were shipped by UPS. All of these packages create efficiencies as it allows for more cost-effective distribution since there are more packages likely going to similar places on similar paths. If Amazon reduces its volume with UPS, we could see a challenge to make that business up elsewhere.OpportunitiesUPS demonstrated it's able to handle and deliver favorable performance during peak shipping periods, which have proved troublesome in the past. Cutting operating expenses by 7.5% in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 was a welcome change compared to the increases experienced in both the fourth quarters of 2014 (9.4%) and 2015 (7.5%). The company made several moves including the acquisition of Coyote Logistics and the usual hiring of seasonal labor. Most importantly though, UPS is doing a better job of selecting more favorable types of additional volume by pricing packages by size and weight, implementing pricing initiatives to smooth peak demand, and increasing its efforts on shipping rates with customers which all are contributing to its superior margins. While there is concern that this may limit growth, the growth lost may not be they type UPS is seeking.UPS experienced positives in other areas of operation as well with all three segments reporting operating income growth in the double digits.Source: UPSFedExIn the Orange (and purple) corner we have FedEx. Currently paying a dividend of 0.78% yield with a PE of 29.8x, and an EPS of $4.28 this stock is about 33% off its 52 week high of $185.19. Most recently FedEx reported Q4 earnings with an EPS of $2.58, beating estimates by $0.06 with revenues of $12.5 billion which were a 4.7% year-over-year increase, beating estimates by $50 million. They maintained FY2016 guidance of $10.40 to $10.90.RiskShare buybacks - that's right - share buybacks. Share repurchase programs have been a significant component of the company's history, returning nearly $8 billion to shareholders since fiscal year 2014 by repurchasing more than 57 million shares and significantly reducing its share count (inflating EPS).Shares are priced well below the 52 week high due in part to looming fears on the horizon of a slowing global economy and has dragged shares down to a 12x forward earnings multiple, a buyback does not seem like the worst idea in the world, we should ask how this buyback be funded?Another important distinction that must be made is the amount of cash FedEx had in 2013 compared to what it has now. At end of fiscal year 2013 the company had $4.9 billion in cash and equivalents, in contrast to less than $3 billion in debt. Fast forward to the end of November 2015, the company had just $3.6 billion in cash and a debt level that had increased more than double to $8.5 billion. Keep in mind that the purchase of TNT becomes official in the coming months, in which FedEx will pay $4.8 billion in cash.The total bill of the TNT purchase and the share repurchase program totals approximately $8 billion. This would not be as alarming to me if not for FedEx's limited FCF; which is growing, but so is there Capex.OpportunityGrowth. With the purchase of TNT FedEx may finally surpass UPS in sales and furthermore it would kick UPS out of its #2 slot in Europe with only DHL to surpass. This could set FedEx up as a growth stock with a much higher ceiling for expansion. With the acquisition FedEx will hold approximately 22% of the European express delivery market, while UPS currently has 25%. The combination of FedEx's large fleet of aircraft and strong presence in both the United States and Asia will be nicely complimented by TNT in Europe and allow for more efficiencies and cost cutting practices by eliminating duplicate positions and consolidating shipments.ConclusionUPS has proved it can perform when it counts while FedEx is expanding where it counts, but this match is won by UPS. With UPS paying a more generous dividend (3.04% vs 0.78%), enjoying fatter margins, and showing its ability to execute on strategy; I would feel better at the end of the day holding UPS share rather than FedEx. While I would not rule out FedEx entirely as they certainly have the potential for growth with their move into Europe via TNT, I would closely monitor their debt levels and margins while they are expanding the growing business which will require growing levels of capital expenditures. Perhaps repurchasing shares is not the best move right now as the company is in more of a growth phase at the moment, which would return more value to shareholders rather than buybacks at this time."

What does a successful outcome for FedEx mean for UPS?In what areas will FedEx benefit, and what do they need to do to compete seriously with UPS?","Mergers and acquisitions are never easy, especially when the two parties involved are listed and operate in a highly competitive environment. The problem is even more complex when both parties already have significant market share in that country. That's when antitrust laws come into play.What are Antitrust Laws, and How Do They Keep the Economy Healthy?Essentially, these laws protect consumers by preventing mergers and acquisitions that would allow the resulting entity to gain a monopoly in that market (or even a significant enough majority) - thereby stifling competition and giving them full control over their pricing. There are several other considerations, but this is the simplest way to explain a complex law with numerous implications.The first antitrust law in the United States - the Sherman Act - was passed way back in 1890, as a ""comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade.""In 1914, the Federal Trade Commission was set up to keep an eye on businesses that were attempting to monopolize the market. The idea, as I explained above, was to protect consumers, keep the competition healthy and prevent any sort of cartelization that would negatively impact the economy.The Challenge for Large CompaniesThere is a lot of merit in doing it this way but, the problem is, when you have elected governments involved in the process you never know which way the dice is going to roll. Though in most countries trade regulatory bodies are supposedly independent entities, the governments do tend to have enormous influence on their decisions - and there is no guarantee of a result until the decision has been made.This is what happened with UPS (NYSE:UPS) when they tried to buy TNT Express (OTC:TNTEF) three years ago in Europe. The European Commission, which regulates antitrust laws across the EU, felt that if both companies were to operate as a single unit, it would, in effect, create a monopolistic scenario that would kill competition from smaller companies.Another problem is when multinational corporations acquire each other. The acquiring company needs to get approval from each of the countries that both companies operate in.How FedEx Slipped Into the GapNow UPS, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and DHL pretty much rule the roost in North America and Europe. The former two are the largest in the United States, while DHL is the king of European parcel delivery service.So the question now is: how did FedEx get the approval that was denied to UPS three years ago? Have the laws changed? Did FedEx do something UPS failed to?Not at all.The European Commission clearly stated last November that it does not intend to block the deal, even though the formal approval only came in January this year.Looking at market shares for all four players in Europe, it makes sense why they would say that:Source: The Motley Fool.FedEx is big in the United States, but not so much in Europe. Against UPS's market share of 25% there, FedEx only has a little over 10%. Combined, FedEx and TNT would still have a 22% market share that is smaller than UPS alone. Of course, DHL would still be the leader with 41%.Now, TNT alone has a market share in Europe of about 12-14%, so even at the higher end of that estimate, the FedEx-TNT entity will still control less than 25% of the market.On the other hand, if UPS had gotten approval, that would have meant a majority market share of about 53-55% - and that's why the European Commission rejected that deal. In fact, the company even tried to convince the commission that they would offer several concessions to even out the deal, but the EC didn't bite.As for FedEx, all they need to do is divest TNT's airline division because of laws regarding foreign ownership of airlines. Incidentally (and not by any means, coincidentally), FedEx's main lure for acquiring TNT was its ground capabilities - aka road delivery network - and not international shipping.But there's more. Despite UPS's every attempt to thwart the deal in Europe, it went through. In the United States, the FTC gave their nod to the deal towards the end of last year. Not surprising, though, because TNT doesn't have a significant enough presence in the States to pose any sort of antitrust threat.The issue at the moment, however, is Brazil. Although the Brazilian regulatory authority has approved the deal, there's one provision that UPS is taking full advantage of. In Brazil, other companies can dispute acquisitions by requesting a more detailed review of the deal. You can bet your bottom dollar UPS is not going to miss this opportunity - and they haven't. However, what this means is a mere delay in the proceedings. I don't expect anything to come out of UPS's claim to dig deeper.China poses another problem now because their antitrust laws go beyond just competition. Their entire antitrust system is a relatively new set up with far fewer people reviewing the various elements of the deal. In addition, they intend to look much deeper than mere competition and monopoly: they'll be looking at how the deal could impact the local economy and other factors. We all know that China protects its own, and this could mean an inordinate delay for FedEx - something that will have UPS celebrating, for sure. In fact, I'm willing to bet that they'll be actively exploring ways to further delay the acquisition using the China situation as well.Why Does UPS Want to Block FedEx's Acquisition of TNT?When the acquisition goes through and FedEx starts reporting combined financials, there will be a significant shift in the global power balance between the two companies. So far, UPS has maintained a significant lead over FedEx in terms of revenues, but FedEx along with TNT will close that gap to a great degree.UPS reported $16.05 billion in revenues for the last quarter, while FedEx reported $12.45 billion - a gap of $4.4 billion. With TNT's $2.039 billion (Euro 1.861 billion) thrown in, that gap will get smaller by 45%, putting FedEx at a stone's throw away from UPS in terms of revenues.Source: WSJIn addition, it will shift the market share equation significantly in favor of FedEx, as we've already seen. Globally, it will move FedEx from the 14% level to 18% - with UPS still holding the lead but at a sliver-thin advantage of only 2% or so.So you can see why UPS would want to block this deal in any way they possibly can.FedEx's Real ProblemWith this deal, FedEx may get the closest they've ever been to UPS in terms of global revenues, but they still have a major problem to solve that has little to do with the acquisition - their profitability.FedEx's operating margin is far lower than that of UPS, as you can see above. Since logistics itself is a capital-intensive business, scale means everything - and can make all the difference between profitability and loss-making.If TNT were more profitable, it might help FedEx close in on UPS on this front as well. However, TNT's profitability is even worse than FedEx's, with a reported operating income margin of 3.1% for the fourth quarter of 2015. In fact, during the same quarter in 2014, that same figure was at -3%.The reason I mention scale here is because the acquisition will now give FedEx the scale advantage to compete with UPS. I'm certain that several cost cuts are on the cards once the acquisition goes through, and TNT's employees and assets are likely to be the first ones to go. At this point, that's one of the low-hanging fruits to achieve higher profitability.This deal will allow FedEx to become a serious competitor to UPS; no more a distant second. That means UPS has to be on its toes and find niche markets like healthcare logistics to get into and dominate - something I covered in my previous article, ""The Real Threat To UPS Is UPS.""If they don't move quickly - as quickly as they can, considering their lumbering size - they may well have FedEx slowly overtaking them in the next two to three years.Did you enjoy this article? I encourage you to follow me as I track and report on the battle between America's logistics giants - and other insightful analysis from the worlds of technology, retail, automobiles, and more."
3863856,98056,2016-02-04T06:50:25-05:00,"Fedex's approved acquisition of European company TNT will bring it closer to UPS than ever before.
        Aggressive share buybacks have done nothing to boost stock performance.
        The real problems are the gaping hole in their operational efficiency and mounting debt on the back of conservative free cash flow.","To say that FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is in a slump would be antithetical: they have an aggressive share buy back program; they will gain significant market share in Europe with the acquisition of TNT; and, very soon, they will be earning as much as their arch rival UPS (NYSE:UPS). The company has been churning out good news after good news but the stock has barely moved up; in fact, it's been actually moving down steadily since June 2014.What's Going Well at FedEx?FedEx's acquisition of the Dutch parcel company is a game-changing move that will not only significantly increase the company's penetration in Europe, but also put it almost alongside UPS in terms of market share. After investigating antitrust concerns for nearly six months, European regulators recently approved the deal.The acquisition will see FedEx controlling 22% of EU market share against UPS's 25% and DHL's 41%. It will also narrow the gap with its main home ground competitor, UPS.The acquisition will also help FedEx narrow the gap with UPS on the revenue front: FedEx reported $ 47.4 billion against $58.23 billion by UPS last year. In 2014, TNT reported 6.68 billion Euros in revenues, with a loss of 190 million Euros for the year.Additionally, FedEx will be looking to eliminate any excess resulting from the combined operations in Europe, and exploit as much synergy as possible, thus reducing overall costs and increasing efficiency in the region.Source: Wall Street JournalRevenue Gap Narrows while Market Capitalization WidensWith FedEx poised to earn almost the same as UPS in the near future, it's very surprising to note that UPS market capitalization of $83.8 million is almost 2.5 times that of FedEx's market capitalization of $36.5 billion.UPS is trading at 15 times forward earnings while FedEx is languishing at 10 times. Let's dig a bit deeper to find why the market is not happy with FedEx. The stock price definitely looks like a bargain, but is there something that lies beneath the surface that's putting pressure on it to stay this low?FedEX has been a Poor ManagerAt the very first glance at operating margins for both companies, it's clear where the bulk of the problem lies.In the last ten years, UPS has resoundingly proclaimed that it can manage its costs far better than FedEx can.Source: FedExIn a recent presentation, FedEx set itself a goal to achieve 10% operating margins. That's not going to be an easy task with the industry already struggling to match the needs of explosive growth thrown at it by e-commerce companies - and UPS is not going to make it any easier for them.Case in point: FedEx possibly lost most of Amazon's business to UPS as the company wasn't in a position to part with the sky-high discounts the online retailer was looking for. UPS, on the other hand, was able to do it because it had better margins to begin with - and room to accommodate the needs of a large and growing client. FedEx simply couldn't match up because its margins are already sliver-thin.Debt is Rising while Free Cash Flow is DecliningFedEx's long-term debt has been steadily growing since 2012, and nearly doubled in the last year alone - thanks to their share repurchase program and the steady decline of free cash flow.FedEx Press Release:""Since FY14, we have returned nearly $8 billion to shareowners through the repurchase of over 57 million shares, and we remain committed to delivering long-term value for shareowners,"" said Frederick W. Smith, chairman, president and chief executive officer of FedEx Corp. ""Our profit and cash flow performance is strong, and we will continue to fund substantial investments in the business.""To be honest, I'm completely lost as to what strong ""cash flow performance"" they're referring to. For the sake of perspective, UPS currently has nearly nine times the free cash flow of FedEx, and the divide has significantly widened since 2012.Furthermore, FedEx has used up almost $8 billion in share repurchase since 2014 and, according to their recent press release, the company plans to buy back 25 million shares.FDX has significantly dropped in 2015 and, if the stock hovers around the 120-140 range, a 25 million share buyback can easily hit the balance sheet by $3 to $4 billion.With free cash flow staying below the billion dollar mark, the acquisition of TNT, a capital expenditure in the range of $4 to $5 billion and a stock repurchase program to the tune of another $3 to $4 billion will significantly increase the debt load of the company - possibly forcing it above the $10 billion long-term debt levels of UPS - very soon.Where's All that Money Going?Transportation and logistics is a capital-intensive business to begin with. FedEx expects capital expenditure to reach $4.6 billion in 2016 to fuel the expansion of FedEx Ground network and also to buy additional aircraft. A quick look at the last three years of capex clearly shows that the company needs to re-invest $3 to $5 billion a year just to keep its competitive advantage intact.If the transportation market keeps growing - as it will, on the back of ecommerce growth across the globe - then FedEx has no choice but to keep accelerating its investments.Investor-speak: Not Everything is Bad about FedExFor all that's going wrong, not everything is working against FedEx. For one, the company is gaining ground on UPS in terms of market share as well as revenue; significantly, in the United States.Source: FedExAnother is the TNT acquisition, which will turn the tide in FedEx's favor to a significant degree.In addition, the company has lots of opportunity to improve its margins, but the fruits of that tree will take time to ripen.While these things bode well for the company, there are several opportunities that they cannot continue to ignore.Their operational efficiency is the first of these that comes into question. With operating margins hovering around the 4% level, they have to at least double their performance to be anywhere near UPS.Though the acquisition of TNT is a brilliant move, the biggest spanner in the works right now, in my opinion, is the way they're piling on debt to fund their share buyback program. This is the time when industry growth is strong and companies need to focus on acquiring larger chunks of market share. It's not the time to be creating artificial floors for stock prices by ""returning nearly $8 billion to shareowners.""I believe that's the real reason why the market - despite hearing the good news about the TNT acquisition - failed to respond positively.If they want to command the kind of respect that UPS gets from its investors, FedEx needs to look long and hard at its share repurchase policies and start focusing on margins and growth instead."
3804086,92206,2016-01-12T02:46:53-05:00,"On the backside of a recent market slide, UPS and FedEx are trading near 52-week lows despite the strongest e-commerce holiday season in history.FedEx and UPS are struggling to grow at the rate of the e-commerce sector in the near term, potentially setting up market price volatility that can be exploited by patient investors.Several purchasing strategies are outlined.","In Part I of this series, I discussed the rapidly changing landscape of the retail sector and the rapid growth of e-commerce at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers. My conclusion was that investments in United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) were ways to capture the growth in e-commerce with less risk than investing in online retailers directly, as the two shipping behemoths would be direct beneficiaries of the trend.In Part II of this series, I used several metrics to place valuations on both UPS and FedEx in an attempt to determine which company is a better value for investors. The results came back mixed; both companies had their pros and cons, and both appeared to be undervalued with an edge to FedEx Corporation.The 2015 Christmas season is over, and as I predicted in my first article, it was a whopper for online retailers, smashing e-commerce records. Cyber Monday revenues eclipsed the $3B mark, setting a new all-time record, up 16% from last year. Over the five-day period beginning on Thanksgiving, total revenues were $11.11B, up 17% from a year ago. Data from trackers ShopperTrak and RetailNext, on the other hand, estimated in-store purchases were down an estimated 10.4% and 4.7%, respectively, over the Black Friday weekend.It comes as little shock that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the big winner this holiday season, adding over 3 million Prime members in the third week of December alone, doubling last year's record-setting shopping season for Amazon devices, seeing over 200 million more items shipped for free with Prime this holiday than last, and Prime members doubling their viewing hours of Prime Video YoY.As a result, UPS and FedEx could hardly keep up, with plenty of complaints coming in from angry patrons claiming their packages did not arrive on time. While both shippers had their issues, UPS outperformed FedEx during the holidays - something I expected considering it is a more mature company with superior fleet integration, as highlighted in Part II of this series. Both shippers began the holiday season strong, but bad weather conditions in parts of the US slowed delivery through the networks two days before Christmas.For FedEx, only 77% of overnight service packages were delivered on time December 23rd, compared with 95.2% on December 21st. For UPS, only 79.5% of overnight packages made it on time on December 23rd, compared with 94% on December 21st. By Christmas Eve, both carriers had recovered, with on-time performance rates of 96.2% for FedEx and 97.7% percent for UPS.Perhaps these on-time delivery rates seem low, but let's put the numbers into context. Approximately 60 million packages were delivered on Christmas Eve alone between UPS, FedEx and the USPS - that's a 70% increase over average daily volume. Even with a 99% on-time delivery rate, that would leave about 600,000 packages delivered late. It is clear that e-commerce is growing at such a rapid rate, shippers cannot grow as quickly.The growth rate is so explosive that one can argue UPS and FedEx are transcending being competitors - there is so much available growth within the industry that UPS and FedEx can each have ever-increasing pieces of the pie without stepping on each other's toes, because neither of them are threatening the other's market share. They no longer need to compete directly.Given this alarming change in the marketplace, considering both companies appear to be undervalued based on prior research, it begs the question: ""Why not own both?""Sustainability Of GrowthThere has been much talk recently about Amazon attempting to start up its own fleet for deliveries. This does not concern me for the following reasons:Ownership Strategies - Direct Stock Purchase PlanFor those of you who have read my articles before, you're likely aware I am a huge fan of Direct Stock Purchase Plans [DSPPs] and Dividend Re-investment Plans [DRIPs], which use the strategy of dollar-cost averaging via automated monthly buy-ins to accumulate a position over time. Both UPS and FedEx offer Direct Stock Purchase Plans through Computershare, which means you do not need to be a prior shareholder of record to open an account with either company.The fee schedules are below:The fee schedules are about average for what you can expect from a Direct Stock Purchase Plan - they are far from free, but I have also seen much worse.In order to keep plan costs at 1% or less, a person would have to commit at least $205/month with FedEx and $230/month with UPS with share prices being what they are currently. If a person were to enroll in both plans at these contribution rates, and market prices stayed flat over the year, that person would wind up committing total capital of $5,220 over the course of the year, while paying about $52/year in fees, excluding the one-time initial setup fee. Market price appreciation would reduce fees, since a per-share charge is present on these plans, while a drop in market price would increase total fee costs. Overall, this is less than most of us spend in one month for a mobile phone.Disclaimer: DSPPs and DRIPs do not allow the immediate purchase or sale of stock. Placing a market order can take several days, sometimes more than a week, to execute. These plans have low liquidity and are meant to be long-term holdings, preferably generational holdings. Open these plans only if you intend to be a long-term shareholder, preferably a lifetime shareholder.I feel the DSPP strategy affords the investor the best way to minimize risk. FedEx and UPS are going through big changes to accommodate the growing marketplace, and growing pains - i.e. stock price volatility - can be expected moving forward until the market stabilizes. I expect earnings to be erratic for both companies in this environment, with both huge wins and big misses in the future, and dollar-cost averaging is the best tool I know to help mitigate these risks.Ownership Strategies - Cash-Covered PutsAnother potentially great option for purchasing stock in these two companies is through the Cash-Covered Put Option strategy. This strategy is not as forgiving as a DSPP, because it will require the individual investor to assign a valuation to the company that they are comfortable with. These are the basic steps of the Covered Put strategy via example:WARNING: I am not an options trader. I have never traded options, and this is the system as I understand it. For detailed knowledge of options trading, I suggest you read this article and memorize its contents as written by the esteemed Mr. Richard Berger. I am an electrical engineer by trade, not an investment advisor.Ownership Strategies - Market and Limit OrdersThere's no rocket science here. UPS and FedEx are both down at their 52-week lows. Think that's a great price? Place a market order.Think it's a little too high? Commit some capital to your portfolio and set a limit order at a lower price. If it hits, it hits.ConclusionI firmly believe UPS and FedEx are poised to capitalize big time from the rapidly accelerating growth in e-commerce, but the road to riches will have many bumps along the way. These companies will need to carefully manage their growth moving forward, and scaling two already big companies into even bigger companies is no small task.I hope you have enjoyed this three-part series. As always, happy investing."

Earnings have mostly been a bloodbath, as I highlighted in my recent article, 5 Stocks That Indicate A Rough Christmas Ahead. In my article, I laid out the disappointing 3Q2015 earnings of several key retailers and extrapolated that the pain will continue into the foreseeable future. I blamed most of the results on my generation, The Millennials. We are less interested in retail shopping than the generations before us. We hate navigating through traffic, we hate waiting in lines, we hate paying high prices and we hate using our bodies as mobile billboards for brand logos. We have allowed Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to become a behemoth because of one burning question:""Why would I want to fight traffic and hoards of patrons, bouncing from store-to-store in some mall, unable to locate the product I want on the shelves through all the clutter and mess, when I can sift through an online marketplace that has practically every notable product on Earth and have it shipped to my door for less money?""I can get all my shopping done online before I can even drive to the shopping mall, and most of the time, the prices online are lower because online retailers don't have to deal with the massive overhead costs associated with real estate and sales representatives. And I don't even need to put on pants to do it!Recently, one of Seeking Alpha's most notable contributors, Regarded Solutions, wrote a similarly scathing article about the retail sector as a whole. His outlook appears to be bleak, and I think it would be prudent for anyone thinking about investing in retail to give his article a read. However, my outlook may be even bleaker for a very specific reason.Currently, there is still a large population of Americans who do not use the internet. These Americans grew up without it, and when it became popularized, they simply never adopted the technology. When I visit people's homes ages 65 and older, there is a very good chance they do not own a computer. This segment of the American population - a huge portion of grandmothers and grandfathers that spend a lot of money on gifts for grandchildren around the holidays - still shop exclusively at brick-and-mortar retailers. Eventually, there will come a time where the current generation of 65-and-older's are replaced by my generation and younger. At that point, there will no longer exist a generation of Americans that grew up without the internet. While there will always be a place for brick-and-mortar retail stores, the sector in general will likely face massive consolidation and negative growth in the oncoming years, and as the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boomers continue to age and disappear with time, this activity is likely to accelerate at a rapid pace.Capitalizing On Online ShoppingThe chart above shows the rapid expansion of online shopping versus traditional brick-and-mortar retail shopping. I have found myself at a crossroads. I want to find a way to capitalize on this inevitable mass online expansion, but online retailers are risky endeavors - they come and go with the vigor that match the restaurant space. Remember eToys? Kozmo? Pets.com? The chances of finding the next Amazon.com amongst an ocean of failure are slim. I believe the better question is to ask: ""Who benefits from the rise of online retailing in all aspects?""The answer may be the shipping companies. Specifically, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Federal Express (NYSE:FDX).United Parcel ServiceUPS is the US's largest package delivery company by a wide margin. A few amazing statistics from UPS:Delivery Fleet: 99,892 motor vehiclesUPS Jet Aircraft Fleet: 237Chartered Aircraft: 302Daily Flight Segments: 940 Domestic; 1,015 InternationalAirports Served: 382 Domestic; 346 International2014 Delivery Volume: 4.6 billion packages and documentsDaily Average Delivery Volume: 18.0 million packages and documentsEmployees: 435,000 Worldwide - 354,000 U.S.; 81,000 InternationalIn addition to the United State's largest package delivery footprint, UPS's international marketshare is growing.When added together, UPS saw total 2014 Revenues of $58.2 billion.Federal ExpressFedEx is the US's second largest package delivery company, also by a wide margin.Delivery Fleet: Over 100,000 motorized vehiclesFedEx Jet Aircraft Fleet: 652Airports Served: 375Daily Average Package Volume: 10.744 million packages and documentsEmployees: 325,000 WorldwideSimilar to UPS, FedEx's international marketshare is also growing.When added together, FedEx saw total 2014 Revenues of $45.6 billion.Future Revenues Set To SkyrocketAccording to the US Commerce Department, e-commerce has grown by leaps and bounds year-over-year, with 2014 being the strongest showing in history.

(NYSE:FDX) reported $2.58 adjusted EPS versus our estimate of $2.59, as we wrote in our last piece, and versus the street's estimate of $2.51.The reason we had higher numbers than the street for Q2 was that we somewhat added back the one-time 50bp drag that hit the company in the previous quarter. This gave us higher margins than the street.Quick Take On The QuarterVersus our expectations, revenues came in solid and above the average trend over the last few years. Even with foreign exchange and global weakness, revenues held up, which is a clear outperformer versus other industrials that use these factors as excuses for overall weak performance.The margin improvement was solid, driven by pricing (the company calls pricing ""base rate"").Interest was worse than expected by $.08, which, to investors, is good quality. FedEx beat earnings through operations, not through financing. That said, the lower share count drove some upside ($.03). Non-operating line items net dragged earnings versus our expectations by $.05, which shows a strong quality quarter.The Upcoming Quarter Has The Real Upside PotentialThe real upside, though, comes in this next quarter (FQ3, the holiday quarter). As we wrote previously, the Ground business is the key driver to the overall company. Ground made up 35% of revenues in the recent quarter, but 44% of profits. Ground, within FedEx, holds the biggest exposure to e-commerce.We pointed out in our last note that Ground, last year, made up 46% of overall company profits in FQ2, but jumped to 58% of overall profits in FQ3. We think that 44% of overall profits, this year in FQ2 can jump to 60-70% of overall profits in FQ3, giving us upside.The company told us on last night's call how well that business was doing in this (yet to be reported) FQ3.When building a model and thinking about how it may report for FQ3, the company is telling you here about the most important piece of the business. Keep in mind, holiday orders don't come on December 25th. Holiday shopping online needs to allow time to ship, so the company is seeing it now. This is the time it happens for FedEx. This is not the scenario where even though a company tells you about current business on a quarter, it still has a peak period of two months thereafter where we are in the dark. FedEx is telling us about current peak periods here, which is important.Important Facts On GroundThe company pointed out, as we expressed in our last piece, that Ground pricing and overall pricing was moving up. FedEx said multiple times on last night's call how it is adjusting pricing based on packaging size. That means the company is raising prices for customers to have them migrate to normal package sizes.Ground volumes were up 9% last quarter. Revenues per pack were up 10%. Ex-ing out foreign exchange and oil price pass-throughs, you see the underlying and powerful top line dynamics at Ground of up 19%.The company said, ""Operating income was up 13% due to higher base rates and volume. This is the financial metrics that we are most focused on at Ground."" (Again, base rate means pricing.)Impressive Express Even With Weak InternationalIn the meantime, while we think Ground is going to be the longer-term and shorter-term earnings darling, we think Express, the company's currently largest business, showed impressive results despite down revenues led by FX and global macro issues. Even with that, FedEx said, ""Express is in a sweet spot,"" because it is squeezing out more margin.It said, ""we had nine year high of our margins at Express and those will continue to grow as well with our profits.""Overall, most of the company is running on ""all cylinders""So, we have the company's biggest business, Express, driving earnings. We have its next-biggest business, Ground, accelerating on top line and becoming the most important profit generator of FedEx.That makes up 85% of its revenues doing well. But the stock has traded off with the rest of the industrial sector.Guidance And Street Continue To Appear ConservativeThe company kept its guidance for the year at $10.40-10.90, or the midpoint of $10.65. The street's guidance is at $10.63. Our model has $10.83 by running through current reported trends along with some logic into a spreadsheet.Last year, from FQ2 to FQ3, the year-over-year margin improvements jumped. A peak quarter with an accelerating business can do that. We don't think this story is over, especially given the company's commentary on the business just last night. We are assuming a similar jump in FQ3 from the just-reported FQ2 as we saw last year.The company said, ""Year-over-year, adjusted earnings growth is expected to be stronger in Q4 versus Q3 due to the significant net benefit from fuel in Q3 of last year and the growing benefits from our profit improvement initiatives.""We think if Q4 growth is better than Q3, the annual numbers will beat the company's guidance. We think FedEx is staying conservative. We think the jump in Q3 last year was core business-related, with some benefit from oil.If you look at last year's revenue growth, the comparisons come down last year Q2 through Q4. That makes the top line this year easier each quarter, and may be part of what the company is referring to as Q4 should be better.See the progression here in last year's Q2 to Q3 margin jump and the revenue progression last year from Q2 to Q4 for how it gets easier.For these reasons, we think management appears conservative. They have every reason to be conservative given the global macro climate. That said, they told us on last night's call that current business is very strong in the company's most important driver, Ground, in FQ3.Overall Strong QuarterGiven the quantity of global pressures, FedEx put up a good quarter. We think by taking this quarter and flowing that through to the next couple of quarters, the company is conservative, respectfully so. The street is taking the company's cue despite the clues underlying in the verbal messaging from FedEx. We prefer to plug in our own numbers, which gives us further earnings upside.Chaim specializes in earnings and predicts, analyzes and reacts to earnings and earnings events as well as developing current company and macro stories with a hedge fund perspective.If you want his analysis on Seeking Alpha, scroll to the top of the article and hit ""Follow.""

3753816,32001,2015-12-14T12:30:05-05:00,"Express improves as Ground starts to stumble .Subdued global growth has been offset by lower fuel costs - time for a reversal ? .Technically, a retest and hold of the $140 level would be a good place to add .Since 2008, capex has consumed 87% of FDX's operating cash-flow - that is a big number.","FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), reports their fiscal Q2 '16 after the bell on Wednesday night, December 16, 2015.While most of the attention will be focused on the FOMC meeting announcement and the market response after what is expected to be the first fed funds rate increase in 9.5 years, FDX's quarterly earnings report and conference call is always a good read into many different sectors and global geographies, since management usually gives insightful commentary on the state of the transportation world.Analyst consensus coming into Wednesday's call is expecting $2.52 in earnings per share (EPS) on $12.45 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 18% and 4% respectively.The fiscal 3rd quarter as it stands presently is expecting $2.41 and $12.48 billion in revenue for y/y growth of 20% and 7%. (FDX management usually guide cautiously so it will be interesting to see if those numbers hold up.)Full-year '16 consensus is expecting EPS and revenue growth of 18% and 5% respectively.From a bigger-picture perspective, FDX Express, the freight giant's primary segment at 54% of revenue and 48% of operating income has seen a sharp improvement in margins and operating income the last few quarters as the $1.6 billion ""profit improvement"" plan which was initiated in late 2014, seemed to really be a cost and headcount reduction plan at Express, which was badly needed given that Express volumes had been flat-to-lower for years.However, just as Express's results started to improve, FDX Ground margins have started to deteriorate: in fiscal Q1 '16, Ground saw a 400 bp margin squeeze on ""higher operating costs"" in the segment. Ground is 31% of FDX's total revenue, but half of its operating income as of last quarter. Per FDX management Ground capex will peak in mid-2016.What I worry about with Ground is the spreading popularity of ""2-hour same-day delivery"" which is already starting to pop up in places like Lincoln Park just north of downtown Chicago. The ""Uber/Lyft"" economy, where drivers can get in their car and be livery's from 5 to 9 am and then switch over and be delivery services for maybe Whole Foods, retail grocery or even Amazon, and then convert back to taxi / livery services at 3 pm, you would think could be a potentially disrupting service for FedEx, since an envelope or small package can be just as easily delivered by car as by truck.Or maybe this is an opportunity for Ground to become more ""asset-light"" and use other fuel efficient vehicles for easier package deliveries for urban areas like major cities ?No question I am seeing more cars with the ""Amazon 2-hour delivery"" sign hung or painted on the driver's residential vehicle and I wonder how many of these packages were delivered by FedEx Ground previously.Historically FedEx has been the interplay between volumes and fuel cost, so while FDX has benefited greatly from the drop in fuel cost the last year, the fact that Express volumes have been soft and some of the airplane freight business has seen customers substitute to other lower-cost options, volumes have been so-so, while pricing has remained firm.Valuation: FDX is trading around 8(x) cash-flow, with an expected 3-year average P.E of 12(x) and an average 3-year expected growth rate of EPS of 15%.Coming into the earnings report and after the drop in the stock last week, FDX looks to be about 15% undervalued, and should probably be trading closer to $175 than $145.However the share repurchase program which retired about 10% of FDX's outstanding shares is now complete, and with the rather punk global economic recovery, the lack of global growth has been offset by lower fuel costs.You would think the next catalyst will be better global growth, but that could have been said 5 years ago.Conclusion: All but one long-term position of FDX was sold from client accounts near $150 a while, thus the run to $185 was missed, and even with today's price, the 15% discount to intrinsic or fair value may not be enough enticement to own the stock.FDX has been modeled since the late 1990's and the one metric that has bothered me is that since late 2008, ""capex"" has consumed 87% of FDX's operating cash flow - that is a big hurdle.It takes really robust economic and volume growth to drive operating leverage with that kind of capex."
3781276,64283,2015-12-29T13:06:03-05:00,"FedEx had another Christmas delivery problem this year.In the short-term, there seems to be a pattern of its stock price every January regardless of Christmas hiccups.This pattern might be something to consider as we enter January of 2016 and when evaluating FedEx's long-term prospects.","Case IntroductionFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) failed to deliver packages on time this Christmas, again! Unlike the last two-years, FedEx does not seem to have the same problem as United Parcel Services, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) this holiday season. Some UPS packages seemed to have been delayed as well but the company seems to be less impacted by the storms than its rival. Hence, the focus on FedEx.The FedEx hiccup raises questions of whether or not the company is failing to adapt to the times or if shipping, in general, is not growing at a faster enough pace to keep-up with the growth in e-commerce.A lot of people took their anger to social media to voice out their frustration with many people calling FedEx the ""Christmas Grinch.""However, this is not the first time it has happened and over a long-time, news like this do not seem to affect sales or the stock price in the long-term. But after looking at FedEx's stock patterns in the last 10-years between December 20th to January 20th, I noticed a few patterns. The explanations behind these patterns was reaffirmed by looking at news relating to FedEx surrounding these dates. Patterns that might be crucial as we enter January of 2016.FedEx's Two Year-Christmas Problems(Nasdaq,FedEx stock price, 12/20/2015-12/29/2015)In the last 6 days, FedEx's stock price had started to slightly decline only to make a comeback on December 29 on the back of higher than expected orders. This pattern, in isolation, might seem like a start of a rally to FedEx's 52-week highs of $185.19 but it might not be the case. Not only does the stock seem to decline in January after a Christmas hiccup, but it also declines regardless. Furthermore, the failed Christmas delivery might have broader implications for the company moving forward.The next two graphs shows news surrounding FedEx's December stock declines in the last two years and the company's explanations for the delays.(Nasdaq,FedEx stock price, 12/20/2013-01/20/2014)December of 2013(Nasdaq,FedEx stock price, 12/20/2014-01/20/2015)December 23rd, 2014December 26, 2014Observation IGenerally, exceeding expected orders would, on the surface, seem like a positive attribute, but for more than two years the market has been reacting differently in the short-term. There has been a decline in FedEx's stock price whenever it fails to deliver on Christmas. When I looked at FedEx's stock price to as far as 2006 (with the exception of 2008), the stock tends to go down in January. Maybe this eight-year recurrent pattern might be different this 2016, but it is a risk going into January especially after FedEx experienced Christmas delivery hiccups when its closest rival seemed to have done better. This might create some negative market sentiments as people would have expected better.(Nasdaq, FedEx stock price 2010 - 2013)=Observation IIThe failure to deliver on time because of ""increased orders"" might not be reflective of increasing revenues.You would assume that since FedEx's orders were higher than expected in December of 2014, FedEx's quarterly revenues should have grown faster between December 2013 - December 2014 than between December 2012 - December 2013 but this was not the case. Revenue growth actually declined 0.51% between the same period as shown in the bullet points and graphs below.Looking forward, FedEx might stop being a shipment of choice for big companies and this might start shrinking their revenue growth over-time.(FedEx's 10-Q, period ended 02/28/2013)(FedEx's 10-Q, period ended 02/28/2014)(FedEx's 10-Q, period ended 02/28/2015)ImplicationsThere is a major cause of this delay that is beyond the shipping companies - consumer procrastination. The only reason shipments tend to skyrocket before Christmas is that people wait for the very last minute to place orders (other consumers have claimed they placed orders earlier, but I did not gather any evidence to substantiate the claims). In retrospect, this might not be such a bad thing. Most late shoppers might be willing to pay a premium to compensate for their last-minute decisions.Apart from hiring extra staff and charging procrastinators fees, they can also lease out extra planes to ensure faster and efficient deliveries. I am not certain, however, whether this is profitable for them.However, blaming shipping companies is not a complete story. Shipping companies only get overwhelmed if deliveries exceeds the agreed upon limits. Incentives such as the two-free day shipping or one-day shipping (paying an extra $3.99 or so) for prime members on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), helps drive volume. With Amazon prime members at 3 million and e-commerce sales exceeding brick-and-mortar sales, the demand for faster shipping will only rise over-time.In addition, to make-up for this hiccup, an article paraphrased FedEx saying that some of its employees had ""volunteered"" to work on Christmas to deliver packages to customers. If true, this reflects well on FedEx drivers but not on the company in terms of employee morale. They should be an incentive structure for employees whose Christmas is disturbed to fix a problem they never caused in the first place.Lastly, for the fact that retailers like Amazon are considering alternative shipping methods, is not a good thing. Such a move would be detrimental to the revenue growth of major shipping companies. Because it means that future revenues from large clients like Amazon will be lost especially if Amazon can scale its shipping to a level where it becomes a competitor to both FedEx and UPS. Nonetheless, Amazon's move signals a gap in the market that large shipping companies like FedEx and UPS are not able to cater. This gap will only grow bigger as more people shop online."
3755696,31441,2015-12-15T03:52:34-05:00,"FedEx reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday.The company has enjoyed lower fuel costs, yet FDX has underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.Investors may have priced in a decline in corporate earnings into Fedex's share price.Avoid FDX.","Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect the company to deliver revenue of $12.46 billion and eps of $2.53. The revenue estimate implies growth of 1.4% Q/Q. Investors should sell FDX into earnings for the following reasons:FDX Has Lanquished, Despite Low Fuel CostsIn addition to growth in transportation services, one of the key drivers for FedEx is fuel costs. The lower its fuel costs, the higher the company's earnings should be. For most of this year oil prices have been about 50% below their Q2 2014 peak; prices fell to about $38 last week -- the lowest since 2008. Lower fuel costs have also positively impacted FedEx's earnings:In the quarter ended August 31, 2015 (""FQ1 2016"") revenue of $12.3 billion was up 5% Y/Y, while operating income grew 8%. One of the biggest drivers of the bottom line was lower fuel costs, which fell 36% Y/Y. Said another way, fuel costs fell from 10% of revenue in FQ1 2015 to 6% in FQ1 2016. The company may have squandered some of those gains as salaries, transportation costs and other costs as a percentage of revenue all ticked up.In a terrific environment for fuel costs, FDX has languished. The stock is off about 15% over the past year versus flat results for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).According to management, lower fuel surcharges also negatively impacted revenue last quarter. The index used to adjust the fuel surcharge is updated weekly for FedEx Freight revenue; it is adjusted every six to eight weeks for the other business segments. Nonetheless, the fact that the stock languished in a favorable environment for fuel costs is foreboding.Does A Declining Business Environment Loom?One explanation for FedEx's dismal stock performance is that investors could have priced in lower corporate earnings going forward. In the one-year stock chart above, FDX took a sharp dive at the end of November as the Fed rate hike has neared. If the U.S. economy slows after the Fed removes the punch bowl, FedEx's top line could get hit.Secondly, Q3 2015 S&P 500 eps was on track to record back-to-back quarterly declines for the first time since the financial crisis. If business earnings are expected to decline going forward, it could negatively impact FedEx's earnings. The energy sector has hurt the S&P 500; the decline in energy and the commodities segments are not expected to abate any time soon. For corporate earnings to grow, non-energy segments need to have outsized growth in earnings, which may be challenging.The company's top line seems to support a the thesis that business earnings are declining. FQ1 revenue for FedEx Express (55% of total revenue) was off 4% Y/Y. This segment was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable exchange rates.FedEx Ground (32% of revenue) was up 29% Y/Y. This segment benefited from acquisitions and the recognition of FedEx SmartPost (low rate residential shipping) revenue on a gross basis. Otherwise, FedEx Ground revenue would have increased only 9% Y/Y and total revenue growth would have been flat.That said, some of the volume that used to go for express service may be soaked up by ground transportation. If Express Ground revenue flattens out amid a declining business environment, FDX could fall further.ConclusionFDX has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past year by a wide margin. Investors could have priced the impact of a declining business environment into the share price. I expect corporate earnings to continue to decline, which will eventually materialize into lower revenue for FedEx. Avoid the stock."
3696296,96246,2015-11-19T14:45:03-05:00,About to clear peak investment.Highest margin business growing the fastest and accelerating the overall pie.E-commerce exposure a benefit in the holiday season.Return ratios to accelerate over the next 12 months.,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has been given credit for its exposure to e-commerce but we believe that reported numbers are going to start more clearly exposing the faster growth rates associated with the e-commerce industry. Faster growth rates should lead to earnings acceleration and a pickup in returns ratios offering FedEx a higher earnings multiple and higher stock price.Overall, top line revenues were up about 6% last quarter, which was faster than any time in the last few years, but we think it can continue to accelerate.Add to that, the bottom line and returns ratios, as we pass a major expense push this year, should also see accelerating numbers.What we like to see in companies is that a strong secular dynamic actually shows up to make a difference to a company's operations.We spoke with the investor relations team who told us that 40-50% of their business now is exposed to e-commerce, which is growing at 9-11%, faster than the overall company.So, you may ask, why is that not showing up in their numbers? First of all, it is but we believe it will show up more clearly soon (as we will explain below). In the meantime, there are several factors that have been non-operationally ('artificially') holding back top line revenues*Oil Prices: Because the prices get passed on to the customer, lower oil prices make revenues appear lower with minimal impact to profits. Oil price change is passed on to the customer both up and down so the impact to FDX is minimized but the 'optics' of revenues appear to be slower than they are for this reason.*Foreign Currency: Because their foreign sales get reported in dollars, we don't see the organic growth.If both oil and FX manage to stay flat from here, we will begin to lap the peak and the declines from earlier this year as we flip into the next calendar year. This, by itself, will allow the underlying faster top line to shine through removing the drag from these factors. We don't need FX and oil to stop going down for FedEx to work, but it will help to see the 'real' numbers shine through.More importantly though we have operational reasons for top line to show acceleration.Their Main Business, Ground Should Drive AccelerationTheir ""Ground"" business is now 30% of the overall revenues but now 50% of overall profits up from 30% of company profits just a year or two ago. This business is the biggest beneficiary of the e-commerce trends and where you can pinpoint the benefit to FedEx.The fixed assets in this 'old stodgy' company are getting levered by the faster internet growth rates, which is why the profits are accelerating in the Ground business.Inflection Point At GroundNow that Ground is 50% of profits and growing faster than the mix, the entire company's profits should begin to be more influenced by Ground and e-commerce than any other business or end market in its portfolio. That is the simple formula of what can accelerate (or decelerate a company's business).When we look for a company to benefit from a trend, we look to see what percentage of revenues and profits are exposed to that trend. In FedEx's case, Ground is becoming an important enough size and is about to move the pie and move the needle.Inflection Near Term With Holiday Benefit One Quarter AwayOne item holding back FedEx last quarter was international weakness causing them to hold back their expectations this year. We think this could continue to hold them back this quarter (Fiscal Q2). In fact, this would probably be the biggest risk. Last quarter, the stock went down after earnings because of company comments that international was not picking up as they had planned. We think their reset estimates account for this but this could still be a risk in this quarter. Thereafter, one quarter out, is when we have a purer play to see the full effect of e-commerce in the holiday season.The holiday season is of course the biggest beneficiary to their largest business driver, Ground. We think Ground instead of being 30% of revenues can make up closer to 35% of revenues in that quarter and give more of a nearer-term impact to show investors the impact of this important business.Last year, as an example, Ground jumped from Q2 to Q3 as a percent of overall profits from 46% to 58%. This year, we think Ground can make up 60-70% or more of the Q3 profits. That is shorter-term thinking, but we think it will be a clear catalyst to remind investors how the overall mix of this company's revenues and profits are evolving to something more of a higher return, faster growing company.As the top line accelerates in their seasonal holiday quarter (Fiscal Q3), their fixed cost growth, which doesn't accelerate with holidays, should allow margins to also accelerate.Last quarter, the company reported one-time hits affecting margins by about 50bp and the overall operating margins were still moving up because of revenue growth and cost initiatives. We think as the one-time hits fade and peak quarters' revenues take precedence, an elevated capex should get better levered allowing margins to pick-up, driving upside.Two Horse Race For NowUPS (NYSE:UPS) has been having issues and has been forced to raise prices to meet profit targets. FedEx has been consistently raising prices for several years now. Prices drop straight through to profits. Now that UPS is raising prices, this is another driver to overall profit growth and non-capital using ('free') profit drivers.UPS revenues have been running down which de-levers expenses hurting margins. Their strategy of raising prices is saving them from losing more money and helping FedEx and the market raise prices. UPS is the largest player in the space, so getting price hikes from them helps the entire group.FedEx calls these price hikes base rate increases. They are also masked by the oil price drop but if you were to segment out the oil drop from revenues, you would see underlying pricing is being captured by FedEx flowing through to earnings. Base rate pricing has been up low-mid single digits (excluding out oil), which again, falls straight to the bottom line.Expect Shopping To Shift Online For Holiday Supporting Growth For FedExWe think that the disturbing geopolitical news has a chance to slow people from going out to the malls, but not keep people from shopping altogether. Often times, news can keep people watching TV pushing out shopping trips. Instead, we think shoppers will shift dollars online this holiday benefiting the sector and FedEx.Capex Peak This Year, Return On Equity To Accelerate Next YearOn the last earnings call, the CEO of Ground, Henry Maier said that he expected this fiscal year to be ""pig in the python"" with regards to Capex. Capex, overall, jumped for the overall company last year to $4.3B up from $3.5B the year before and is expected to be around $4.6B this year, also another jump. That said, Maier said his expectations for capex for next year are to be down.Just as the company slows capex next year is exactly the time when we think the largest profit driver is going to drive the overall company's profit mix to a faster pace. Thus, return metrics for the overall company should pick up.Leverage Of Fixed Assets To ImproveWith industrial companies, one of the main criteria to catch a developing story is to see how the revenue growth compares to expenses. In this case, we expect the overall expense structure to grow in the 2-4% range as it has been growing. If the top line accelerates as the mix of revenues leans more and more to online growth rates, with expenses steady, more drops through to earnings.FedEx also is driving down their costs by increasing the amount of automated hubs, new aircraft and generally finding cost opportunities. All this will help the accelerated top line potential flow through to the bottom line.PE/Multiple ExpansionWe expect ROE and top line to expand in unison, which will help FedEx afford higher valuations.Our Earnings Targets Higher Than The StreetFor Q2 (This quarter) we are $2.59 versus the Street of $2.54. Next quarter is where we show more upside. We are at $2.75 for FQ3 (the holiday quarter) versus the Street of $2.45. Last year, FQ3 saw 250 basis points of EBIT margin improvement because of the peak period levering expenses. We are using 200bp on top of that in this year's FQ3, which is likely the key to get us above the Street. We think there could even be upside to our number if things go right.For the fiscal year, we are expecting $10.90 versus the Street of $10.68. We see the real upside coming next year. We have $13.30 for Fiscal '17 versus the Street of $12.21 as cost growth slows and top line picks up.Price Target Looking For Upside of 25-50% In The Next 12 MonthsIf we use a 15-18 P/E on next year's numbers versus the 12-15 P/E that exists, we get a target of $200-240 12 months out or a 25-50% upside from current levels, based on our earnings numbers.All in, we think FedEx is a quality company with strong management and a leading market position in an important sector, which they are capitalizing on. We think investors will see the main piece of that performance show through in Holiday and thereafter. We also think that FedEx will begin to get even more credit for their Ground business as it increases in importance within the overall company's metrics.Chaim Siegel has been working for hedge funds and mutual funds as an analyst and PM his entire career.

3670726,51022,2015-11-10T07:16:46-05:00,"FedEx's shares have lost over 5% over the last 52 weeks. Historically, the company's shares have traded in tandem with the market.I think that mean reversion and seasonal tailwinds may cause the stock to appreciate significantly in the short term.My valuation model makes me think that FedEx is somewhat undervalued in the present time. Its shares offer a substantial margin of safety.I set a target price range north of $210 per share for the next 12-24 months. Keep in mind that the stock has never reached this level before.","As the holiday season approaches, I decided to look at a few transportation companies (i.e. mail & post). I think that a few of them may face seasonal tailwinds in the short term, especially given the fact that their shares are still recovering after the August beating:(Source: Bloomberg)Note: the stock's price returns are compared to the S&P 500 Index's performance and returns of United Parcel Service, Inc., (NYSE:UPS) Deutsche Post AG (OTCPK:DPSGY), and Royal Mail Plc (OTCPK:ROYMY). I chose these companies because they either operate in the same market and/or have similar market capitalizations.FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) caught my attention for two reasons. First, its shares have lost the most in the peer group. Secondly, it is the second biggest publicly traded transportation company measured by its total enterprise value. The company's shares have mostly moved in tandem with the broader market, as the five-year historical data shows:(Source: Bloomberg)Over the same time frame, FedEx has increased revenues by 11% to $47.5B as of May 2015, EBITDA by ~33%, and dividends by over 50%. More importantly, the company's management effectiveness ratios, such as ROA and ROCE, also increased: from 6.1% to 8.3% and from 9.7% to 13.6%, respectively. On the other hand, the company's return on equity has decreased from low teens to high-single digits over the past five fiscal years. Overall, there have been both positive and negative developments in the company's financial and operating performance.What I like to look at the most is the company's ability to generate free cash.The free cash flow analysis shows that the company has not been consistently generating sufficient cash to cover both dividends and buybacks over the last five years:(Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author)If we look at the above table closely, we can see that FedEx's dividends, on average, present a fairly small portion of total free cash flows. Relatively large share buybacks have forced the company to take on additional debt ($6.2B+ over the last three fiscal years). In short, FedEx does generate positive free cash flows, although erratically, and its dividends are sustainable, as far as the historical data show.DCF AnalysisFedEx's DCF model has three scenarios built-in: a Base Scenario (4.0% CAGR in revenues in the next five years, a growing EBITDA margin to ~20.5% in fiscal 2020, and a 10% discount rate), a Bull Case (5.8% CAGR in the top line, an increasing EBITDA margin to 21.5% in fiscal 2020, and a 10% discount rate), and a Stress Case (2.6% CAGR in revenues, a stable 15.0% EBITDA margin through fiscal 2020, and a 10% discount rate). The model's Base Scenario's output is provided below (see the rest in the model):(Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author)The above calculations translate into the following target price per share matrix (for the next twelve months):(Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author)The above tables show that shares of FedEx offer a good potential, given the current price of about $160 per share. However, the DCF analysis alone is not sufficient to conclude on the company's true value.Comparative AnalysisLet us compare FedEx to its immediate peers to see how the company grows relative to the market and how efficient it is compared to them. The following table has been compiled with data from Capital IQ:(Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author)The relatively good operating performance is not immediately translated into above-average valuation multiples:(Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author)I think that the main reason why FedEx's relative efficiency is not reflected in the price multiples is its below-average growth rates: both in revenues and EBITDA. I therefore think that the current multiple of ~7.0x adequately value the company.Debt SituationDebt is an important concern for companies, especially in the current environment when the future of interest rates is uncertain. I have built the following debt maturity table so that you can see how FedEx's financial liabilities are structured (pension fund liabilities are excluded):(Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author)As you can see, most of the company's debt (about 54%) is due in at least a decade from now. All of the company's debt is comprised of fixed-rate securities that yield about 4.4% annually (pre-tax). The after-tax cost of debt is about 3%. What readers should conclude from the above analysis is that the company is not going to be directly or substantially affected by an interest rate hike. Moreover, the company is unlikely to face liquidity issues in the near future, as its debt portfolio is optimized for the long term.A comparative credit analysis performed by S&P Capital IQ shows that FedEx Corporation is ranked the highest among its peers:(Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author)The bottom line is FedEx Corporation has the least credit risk in the peer group. The interest coverage ratio has stayed in the high teens over the last two years, despite the growing debt balance. The company's cash conversion cycle has remained dead at 25 to 26 days. The Net Debt/EBITDA ratio has stayed at 0.5x over the last two days. To me, this is convincing evidence that the company has been managing its debt very well.Historical EBITDA Multiple AnalysisThe chart below shows a drastic recent downtrend in the company's EBITDA multiple:(Source: Capital IQ. Infographics by author)FedEx's EBITDA multiple fluctuated within a range of ~7.0x and 8.5x until August 2015, when it broke below the resistance level. It then dropped to a minimum of ~6.0x and then bounced back to the resistance level. The 7.0x EBITDA multiple I used in the model to calculate the company's terminal value is at the lower end of the historical range. Hence, readers may expect a moderate multiple expansion in the future (a mean reversion), all other things being equal.Before we move on, I would like to analyze the historical values of the EBITDA multiple a little further. There are a few reasons why the multiple declined. The biggest factor contributing to the decline in the multiple is the 12% decline in the market value of the company's shares. Most of it took place in August 2015. The stock has not recovered since then.Secondly, EBITDA has increased by over 10% since the beginning of 2014 (i.e. downward pressure coming from the increase in the denominator). The added debt during 2014-2015 somewhat offset the decline in the multiple by increasing the ratio's numerator (Enterprise Value). However, this ~$4.5B increase in EV was partially eroded by an increase in cash: from $2.9B at the end of fiscal 2014 to $3.7B as of May 31, 2015. Overall, one can conclude that the EBITDA multiple has decreased mainly for two reasons: (1) a decline in the market capitalization (a neutral factor) and (2) a growth in EBITDA (a positive factor). Further, I can say that the multiple has a good chance to rise back to the 7.5x-8.0x levels in the short term.OpinionI issue a BUY recommendation on the shares of FedEx Corporation with a target price range of $210-$235 per share, which translates into an upside opportunity of 30%-45% over the next 12-24 months. I think the upside opportunity can compensate for the exceedingly low dividend yield the stock currently offers. Keep in mind that the upcoming holiday season may give the stock (as well as the entire transportation sector) a short-term boost. This is very probable given that the entire sector is still recovering after August's mayhem."
3749126,92206,2015-12-10T23:03:14-05:00,Logistics present an opportunity to profit indirectly from skyrocketing online retail sales growth.Both UPS and FedEx dominate the marketplace and are ideal candidates for investors to consider.I attempt to place a valuation on each stock to determine which is the superior long-term investment.,"In Part I of the series, I presented the argument that shifting market conditions will continue to cause online retail sales to skyrocket, mostly at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailing. My hypothesis is that investors can reap the benefits of online retail sales growth without investing in failure-prone online retailers by investing in the shipping and logistics space, most notably United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Federal Express (NYSE:FDX). Both companies stand to see big growth in their future if properly managed throughout this transition.In Part II, I will attempt to evaluate both UPS and FedEx stock to see if either - or both, or neither - stock is attractive at current market prices and poised for growth. I will attempt to do this through the use of multiple models for a more detailed analysis.Dividend Discount ModelThe Dividend Discount Model [DDM] attempts to value the price of a stock by using predicted dividends and discounting them back to present value. Below are detailed charts of both UPS's and FedEx's dividend growth since 2009.*projected*projectedWe will assign a value to each stock using the following equation:Value = (Dividend Per Share)/(Discount Rate - Dividend Growth Rate)UPS has seen average dividend growth of 8.4% per year.FedEx has seen average dividend growth of 13.82% per year.My Discount Rate will be 10%, because if I can get 8% averaging into the S&P 500, I need a premium for my added risk. Using these figures, we yield the following results.UPS Value = (2.92)/(0.10-0.084) = $182.50/shareFedEx Value = (1)/(0.10-.1382) = incalculableBecause FedEx's dividend yield is small with rapid growth and a low payout ratio, this method is effective only at evaluating UPS, which is more of a matured dividend stock. The methods below will attempt to close the gap between the two companies.Benjamin Graham FormulaValue = EPS X (8.5+2g) X 4.4 / Y, whereEPS: Diluted trailing 12-month EPS8.5: P/E ratio of a 0% growth stockg: Growth Rate for the next 7-10 yearsY: 20-yr corporate AAA bond rateThe Benjamin Graham intrinsic value formula is one of the best known ways of calculating the intrinsic value of a stock. In our case, we will assume the growth rates of each company is the current dividend growth rate minus 100 basis points - 7.4% for UPS and 12.82% for FedEx. The current 20-year AAA corporate bond rate is 3.83% at the time of writing this according to Yahoo Finance.UPS Value = [(4.36)*[8.5+(2)*(7.4)]*(4.4)]/(3.83) = $116.71/shareFedEx Value = [(3.80)*[8.5+(2)*(12.82)]*(4.4)]/(3.83) = $149.04/shareComparable MethodsFree Cash Flow StatisticsWhile free cash flow for each company varies widely, the slope was applied to each chart in an attempt to linearize the data. This shows UPS's free cash flows increasing twice as fast as FedEx's, but with more volatility.Closing ThoughtsUPS is a bit easier to place a valuation because it is a more mature company than FedEx and has a history of higher yielding, more stable dividend growth. By all accounts, UPS seems to be undervalued, with share values being somewhere in the range of $116-182. While that is a gigantic spread, it goes to show that the successes of a logistics company depend heavily on management. With excellent management, the potential is sky high, but if management makes mistakes, profits can be eroded rapidly.Models have more difficulty valuing FedEx. Sporting a high ttm P/E, Graham's model, which admittedly is more appropriate for very large blue chip companies, places the stock at fair value. However, when evaluating FedEx's explosive dividend growth and super low payout ratio, setting the stage for more rapid dividend growth in the future, the potential for overall growth is so high that it cannot be calculated using traditional means for blue chip stocks.However, when it comes to more basic valuation metrics, the tides turn. UPS's forward P/E implies the market is placing a fair-somewhat-undervalued price on UPS (given its potential future growth), but FedEx appears to be very undervalued. While I'm not one to bet heavily on forward P/E since it's just a guess, FedEx shines like the sun with Price/Book, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow and Debt/Equity ratios.There are risks associated with investing in logistics - fleet costs and maintenance, higher rates of injury from vehicle accidents and lots of lifting of packages (and therefore lawsuits and workman's comp claims), fuel price fluctuations, etc. Much of the success boils down to planning and efficiency. However, given the shift in industry dynamics, there will likely be high rates of growth in this sector. Both FedEx and UPS have their advantages and disadvantages, and the better investment may depend on the individual needs of the investor. FedEx has much lower debt and a much higher potential for future growth from its low payout ratio, rapidly expanding dividend, lower cost of labor and smaller footprint. UPS has a larger market share, a larger, more predictable dividend, superior integration and more free cash flow. As a young person of 29, I have a preference for FedEx because I have a longer investment timeframe than most to absorb volatility, expect higher growth rates due to its smaller footprint, prefer its balance sheet due to the much lower debt and (hopefully) will see the trend of rapid dividend expansion continue."
3686006,96476,2015-11-15T12:32:38-05:00,"FedEx's share price is down 17% from its 52-week high.I will discuss several indicators, including a major potential acquisition and the strong performance at FedEx Ground and Express segments, that FedEx's stock price should trend upward in 2016.Accordingly, now may be a great time to invest in FedEx.","As we enter the holiday season with FedEx's (NYSE: FDX) shares currently trading at $158.19, 27 points off its 52-week high of $185.19, the question arises: is this a good time to buy? Will the price continue to dip or is a rebound around the corner? Here are 4 reasons the author believes the latter to be the case.1. Pending Acquisition of TNT ExpressAccording to its most recent 10-K, as of April 6th, 2015, FedEx entered into a conditional agreement to acquire TNT Express N.V. (OTC:TNTEF) (OTCPK:TNTEY) for approximately $5 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2016 and should be watched closely. This planned acquisition is part of FedEx's drive to grow its operations in Europe. TNT has one of the most robust delivery networks in continental Europe and its acquisition should lead to steadily increasing market share for FedEx in that area. While the deal is by no means finalized, should it be approved, FedEx's share price should experience a significant uptick. While the cost of integration should offset any increased revenue in the short term, the long-term impact of the acquisition should drive down operating costs in Europe while revenue rolls in from the increased market share. The timing of the deal could prove particularly fortunate as a weak Euro continues to drive demand for European exports and intracontinental trade in Europe remains strong.2. Lower Fuel CostsFuel costs have plummeted over the past 12 months. According to FedEx's most recent 10-Q, Q1 2016 average fuel cost per gallon is down to $2.55 for vehicle and $1.88 for jet fuel compared to Q1 2015 costs of $3.69 and $3.08. Somewhat counter-intuitively, this has had a slightly negative overall impact on consolidated operating income for Q1 2016. This is due to reductions in fuel expenses being offset by reductions in fuel surcharge revenue collected. However, lower fuel surcharges lead to lower prices paid by consumers and may lead to increased demand for shipping services. Should fuel costs increase, expect surcharges to follow suit and revenue to grow slightly faster than fuel expenses. In either eventuality, FedEx should do well.3. Strong performance at FedEx Express and solid growth at FedEx Ground segmentsAccording to FedEx's most recent 10-Q, FedEx Express continues to successfully implement the Profit Improvement Plan it began in 2013. This has helped reduce Express' formerly bloated cost structure and lead to increases in operating income in each year since its inception. Even in the face of a Q1 2016 4% decrease in revenue compared to Q1 2015, mostly attributable to the aforementioned decrease in fuel surcharges, Express' operating income increased by 45% due to a 7% reduction in operating expenses. Look for such performance to continue heading into the rest of 2016.FedEx Ground has been on a roll for over a decade now, having increased its market share in each of the last 16 years. Average daily package volume increased by 4% in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015 due mostly to growth in FedEx's Home Delivery service. Overall, revenue increased by 29% but was offset by a 36% increase in expenses, leading to an overall decrease of 1% in operating income. This was mostly due to higher self-insurance costs. The acquisition of GENCO Distribution Systems Inc., a leading North American third-party logistics provider, was a response to FedEx customers' request for a better method to manage e-commerce returns. Increased customer satisfaction with FedEx's handling of e-commerce shipping should help to continue FedEx Ground's yearly growth in market share.4. Record holiday volume projectedFedEx is projecting 317 million packages will be delivered between Black Friday and Christmas Eve this year, a 12.4% increase over prior year, according to an article published in the USA Today. Applying lessons learned from the disastrous 2013 holiday season, FedEx hired an additional 50,000 seasonal workers and invested heavily in improvements aimed at increasing efficiency and capacity which led to drastically increased delivery rates during the 2014 holiday season. While significant additional expenses were incurred in order to provide increased service, this was surely a better result than the bad press and huge amounts of refunds doled out in 2013. For the 2015 holiday season, FedEx expects to hire 55,000 seasonal workers. This is a 10% increase in hires to handle a 12.4% increase in volume. As the percentage increase in hiring in 2014 outstripped the percentage increase in shipping, some of these workers were precautionary hires that ended up not being necessary due in part to more favorable weather conditions, and therefore, unnecessary expenses were incurred. With a bit of cooperation from Mother Nature, FedEx should be able to deliver the same quality of service provided last year while keeping payroll expenses more manageable, leading to a better operating margin for the holiday season."
3656566,51302,2015-11-06T09:23:03-05:00,FDX has not had consistent growth in years.Management is compounding shareholder woes by mismanaging earnings use.Investors should stay away from FDX until the price comes down.,"Historical EarningsFederal Express (NYSE:FDX) has not been too successful in growing earnings. For 10 years revenue has been growing steadily, but slowly. However, operating cash flows minus CAPEX (net operating cash flows) have been volatile and on average, flat:This lack of growth comes in spite of numerous acquisitions and about 15 - 20% of annual earnings retained each year. Given the trouble management has had with growing cash flows in the past, one would be justified in being skeptical about its ability to increase them in the future. However, FDX's profits are largely driven by fuel costs and volumes shipped. Fuel prices have been falling in 2015 and will probably remain low for some time. Shipped volumes have been increasing and as long as the US economy continues to show growth, FDX will have revenue growth as well. For revenue growth to translate into profit growth, however, capital expenditures will need to be stabilized; they have been growing for years and are eating into operating cash flow gains. Still, even if management can get profits to grow, the way they used past profits should concern investors.Share RepurchasesSince 2012, management has been repurchasing a large amount of shares. In fact, they have spent the equivalent of over 100% of net operating cash flows to repurchase shares in the last 4 years:Among other reasons, FDX has been issuing debt to help buy back its shares - usually not a good use of debt. After spending all that money, share count has decreased by 11%. Given the amount spent, one should expect a bigger decrease in share count, however, a large portion of the shares repurchased are not retired, but are used as employee compensation. In the most recent 10-K (page 103), management admits that earnings will be used for future share repurchases mostly to offset employee compensation. The recent amounts spent on share repurchases should remind investors that a large portion of their ""profits"" are actually not really profits.The DividendThe good news for FDX's dividend is that it is steady and growing. The bad news is that, at the current share price, the dividend yield is around .6%. The dividend has been growing at about 10% a year, but at its current level, it would take nearly 20 years for it to grow to where it yields 3%. It is good that management is returning some earnings directly to shareholders, but the dividend is too low.In SummaryFor years now, FDX has been using retained earnings and issuing debt to finance acquisitions and re-invest in the company. The results have been little to no growth. FDX has also been spending large amounts of cash, both from earnings and debt, to repurchase shares. But these efforts have been to largely offset dilution from employee compensation, with only mediocre reductions original share count. Shareholders deserve better use of their profits and the best way to better that use would be an increase in the percentage of earnings used for dividend payments. Yes, FDX could improve both its earnings growth and the efficiency of its share reductions; however, until it demonstrates the ability to do so, FDX is not a buy at its current price.You can find the data used in this article can be found here."
3560286,86456,2015-10-08T14:50:37-04:00,"FedEx announced a new fuel surcharge which will be added to shipping costs, despite the 24% drop in diesel fuel over the past year.With shipping costs higher heading into the holiday season, retailers will likely pass higher costs on to customers who in turn will have less purchasing power.While both FedEx and UPS are trading at valuations below recent peaks, we're passing on an investment as the fuel surcharges could cause public backlash against these companies.","It's going to be a bit more expensive for retailers to ship packages this holiday season. That's because both United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) have announced fuel surcharges to their shipping rates, increasing the cost merchants must pay to ship goods to their customers.The most recent increase was announced this week by FedEx, marking the company's second ""fuel surcharge"" increase this year.With the new surcharge that takes effect November 2nd, retailers will pay about $170 more than the standard rate for shipping 100 shoeboxes overnight from New York to Atlanta (according to the Wall Street Journal). UPS has a similar charge that adds about $200 to the same shipping example above.Ironically, at the same time that these shippers have been increasing their fuel surcharges, the cost of fuel has actually been declining. Below is a 1-year chart of the retail price of diesel fuel, which has fallen roughly 26% over the last 12 months.(source: YCharts)One would think that FedEx and UPS would at least try to get a little more creative with how they classify their price increase. Blaming higher shipping rates on a ""fuel surcharge"" during a period in which everyone knows that fuel prices are falling seems like a very good way to ostracize key merchant customers.Three Scenarios For Handling the SurchargesThe way we see it, UPS and FedEx are raising their prices in an effort to boost profit margins. This, by the way, is perfectly legal and we believe in these companies' right to set prices wherever they see fit.If prices are too high, competitors like DHL or another shipping upstart will come in and begin offering shipping services at a lower rate. It's not inconceivable for a company like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to start its own shipping company, given Amazon's logistical strength and close relationship with merchants.But with UPS and FedEx raising prices through ""surcharges"" they will be able to advertise certain ""base rates"" for merchants and then tack the surcharge on top of the advertised rate. As these higher rates go into effect, we see the market reacting in one of three ways:1) Retailers eat the costs. It's possible that retailers will keep their prices at the same levels and simply pay up to ship merchandise this holiday season. By keeping prices stable, these companies should see their top line revenue remain stable and in-line with consumer trends. But higher expenses will eat into profits causing the retailers to book smaller overall profits during the important holiday season.Under this scenario, the shippers win at the expense of retailers. But we don't believe this scenario is very likely.2) Retailers pass costs to consumers, who willingly pay. It's also possible that retailers will increase prices (or shipping fees) on items in an effort to offset their higher costs. If consumers do not adjust their purchasing habits and continue to buy the same merchandise that they would have otherwise purchased, retailers will be able to maintain their profits.Under this scenario, the shippers win again, this time at the expense of consumers. But the laws of supply and demand tell us that this is unlikely. Consumers will likely buy less if prices are higher. Especially in today's market where job growth is showing signs of weakening.3) Retailers pass costs to consumers, who decide to buy less. The most likely scenario is that higher shipping costs will result in higher merchandise prices. And with only so much discretionary spending capital available, the higher shipping costs will ultimately lead to fewer items purchased and lower volumes for shippers.This scenario hurts everyone... the shippers, the retailers, and the consumers. And unfortunately, this is likely to be the end result for FedEx and UPS because the current employment market is not strong enough to drive discretionary spending higher.Reasonable Valuations, But Possible BacklashBoth FedEx and UPS currently trade at a price/earnings ratio below recent highs, which means that investors can buy shares at a relatively cheap price compared to previous valuations.(Source: YCharts)Wall Street analysts expect FedEx to grow earnings by 14.5% over the next fiscal year (FedEx has a fiscal year end of May 31). Consensus estimates for UPS call for 10.6% growth over the next calendar year. This is interesting because although FedEx is expected to grow profits more quickly, FedEx is actually trading at a discount to UPS.Investors appear to favor UPS because of the higher dividend yield. UPS currently pays a 73-cent quarterly dividend which nets out to an attractive 2.9% yield. FedEx on the other hand pays a 25-cent quarterly dividend which only represents a yield of 0.7%.If UPS and FedEx are successful in implementing their higher fuel surcharge (while paying 26% less for diesel fuel), we believe the stocks could trade higher.But based on the slow global economic growth, the potential backlash from retailers and the likelihood that the companies will need to roll back their surcharges, we would be inclined to avoid both shippers ahead of this holiday shopping season."
3771616,88266,2015-12-22T12:30:17-05:00,"Amazon is making a big push into order fulfillment, ground transport, last mile delivery and now air transport, all threatening FedEx.There are many vulnerabilities that exist at FedEx that a disruptor such as Amazon could take advantage of.There is still time for FedEx to get things in order and become a much stronger competitor if it gets moving now.","Img 1: A FedEx Express AircraftWith many signs pointing to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launching a service to compete with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS), compromising sort centers, a ground trucking fleet, home delivery fleet and now a fleet of Boeing 767 aircraft there are many implications ahead for FedEx. Amazon will not be able to launch an operation to compete with FedEx and UPS overnight but it starts the timer, leaving FedEx with a limited time now to get itself into shape to compete with a potentially disruptive offering or possibly follow the paths of many other companies who failed to innovate and compete.Strengths For FedExBefore going into all the doom and gloom that COULD result from an Amazon transport and logistics service, I go into the areas of strength for FedEx and areas it will likely continue to excel in for years to come.International services are something FedEx is well known for. The breadth of the FedEx network through FedEx itself and an extensive array of partnerships allows a parcel to be sent between virtually any two points in the world. Any service from Amazon will have a very difficult time replicating this world class network and at least initially will have no need to as the Amazon service will focus on domestic U.S service. In addition, limited use of Amazon outside the USA will also likely hinder its growth in many foreign markets unless Amazon can build a service that is used extensively by third parties, rather than mostly for itself.FedEx Office and the thousands of retail locations worldwide that have partnerships with FedEx are a huge asset for the company. These provide reliable global shipping to many customers looking to make shipments worldwide. This retail network is something that any competitor will have a hard time replicating.FedEx Same Day City is the company's answer to the increasing demand for same day deliveries. The service is currently being launched across the USA and could easily be expanded internationally in the future. The service will compete with many couriers, along with Uber (NYSE:UBER) in some cases. It will likely be a big area of growth for ecommerce as customers living in large metro areas begin to expect such a service more and more. Something FedEx could do to make this service more compelling would be to open fulfillment centers in cities nationwide and store inventory for ecommerce customers there. It could then deliver these products same day in many markets. A failure to do this will likely see Amazon move into this space big time and become much more successful as it can offer fulfilment along with speedy delivery for many ecommerce companies in most major areas.Areas Under ThreatDespite many strengths at FedEx there are many areas of the company that are under threat from any disruptor such as Amazon.Img 2: FedEx fleet utilizationFedEx Express is a large part of the business potentially under threat from Amazon. The Express division mainly operates a large fleet of aircraft that enable FedEx to offer speedy deliveries from many cities worldwide. The business was built however with deliveries of medical supplies, critical documents, high value consumer products and such in mind as opposed to what it has grown into with ecommerce and delivering pasta, diapers, books and everything else Amazon has sent its way. As a result I see the business not positioned optimally to succeed in this area. The business is built to consolidate shipments at the end of the day, move them onto plane one that goes to one of their hubs, arrive at the hub around midnight, and then transition onto another plane for the final leg of the journey to the end destination, arriving in the early morning. This model works for delivering many shipments that arrive to the company at the end of the work day from hospitals, corporations, etc. However with a constant stream of online orders through ecommerce it might make more sense for FedEx to fly multiple flights back and forth throughout the day on certain city pairs, dealing with these parcels as they arrive rather than consolidating them until the end of the day. This current operation leads to average aircraft utilization of 3.3 hours at FedEx, something a disruptor could easily take advantage of and something that leads to high costs.Despite the threat from Amazon it is worth noting the threat from them is only likely to occur in the USA in the near term. Amazon will have a much harder time launching such an operation in markets such as Europe where Amazon is not as popular and FedEx is very strong and Asia where Amazon has little presence. In addition Amazon would be required to negotiate with many countries and would be unlikely to receive permission from authorities to operate domestic flights as a foreign company. The Amazon operation however could inspire other logistics companies and possibly ecommerce companies such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to set up similar operations in other countries if the Amazon venture is a success.FedEx Supply Chain is another area that could see disruption from Amazon and an area Amazon has already moved into in a big way. Amazon will now take third party sellers' products, store them in their warehouse and handle fulfillment and shipping of them. The catch however is that the products need to be items sold on Amazon.com. With 92 U.S fulfillment centers Amazon could be a compelling competitor if it offered its fulfillment center services to third parties without requiring them to be sold on Amazon.com. While Amazon can be compelling for supply chain solutions within the USA it will take a long time before it can become a true global competitor to FedEx in this regard. FedEx supply chain solutions at their world port in Memphis gives customers access to almost every market on the planet while Amazon fulfillment is generally domestic.FedEx Smartpost is another part of the company under threat from Amazon. Amazon recently purchased ""thousands"" of truck trailers to shuttle its products between post offices and its warehouses. In addition its last mile Amazon Flex delivery service combined with its trucking network could become a threat to FedEx ground over time if Amazon opens its services up to third parties.ConclusionThe fact Amazon managed to capture 1/3 of Black Friday sales this year shows its dominance in the ecommerce space and it certainly has the resources and investor base tolerant to take on incumbents such as FedEx and UPS in transportation and logistics. Losing 1/3 of ecommerce shipping could quickly turn into a much larger loss for FedEx and UPS (UPS) if Amazon is able to create a compelling transportation and logistics product that it offers to third parties. One big problem at FedEx is inefficiency in some areas and the lack of collaboration amongst the many divisions that exist at the company is a good example of this. FedEx Ground, Express and Smartpost all operate separate warehouses, fleets and have separate management. FedEx should seriously consider merging operations of these companies together much more if it wants to remove a critical vulnerability that a disruptor such as Amazon could take advantage of. While it is possible Amazon may never open its transportation and logistics services up to third parties, FedEx should start planning as if it will. The sort of operation FedEx has is not something that can be replicated overnight. Such an operation will take years to build up and if FedEx wants to stay on top of the game it will need to start taking a hard look at its operation pretty soon as failure to do so could see the company miss the boat and react too late to a potential disruptor."

The shipping industry is going through several enormous changes, the most important of which is the disintegration of United States Postal Service. In addition, the amount of consumer orders placed through online venues that require shipping has skyrocketed and will continue to do so.There is always going to be a need for shipping. We do not buy into the argument that the Internet is going to kill off the retail shipping sector as a whole because at the end of the day, there are always going to be physical objects that need to be transported from one place to another. As a nonscientific example, even in the show Futurama, in the year 3000, the main characters work for a shipping company that's called ""Planet Express.""We have said over and over that Federal Express is our favorite out of the shipping companies due to its name being synonymous with shipping, the professional job that the company undertakes, the roots that the company has in the corporate world, and a decent management team.We had talked in the past about the company's merger with TNT and why we thought this was a great move for the long-term course of the company. This morning, the news broke that TNT's shareholders had adopted the takeover and that things are moving ahead according to plan.This is another step in the right direction for the company, especially after last quarter's ""poor"" earnings, according to the Street. Here's what a buying opportunity looks like.FDX data by YChartsWe thought that the selloff from last quarter's earnings represented a longer-term buying opportunity for those that are looking to get exposure to the shipping industry and are looking for a company with a yield, even though Federal Express' yield is on the smaller side of most dividend stocks.One of the main reasons that the company had such trouble in its current quarter was that express shipping was down year over year as the company saw its ground offering gain more traction. We don't necessarily see this as a negative, as part of what FedEx has been trying to do is expose itself to shipping that is a product of online shopping. Ground shipping is the best way to do this. In that respect, we're not overly disappointed.The company remains focused and growing out its ground segment which is where it can make up the most room on competitors. By expanding globally through acquisitions like TNT and opening the company up to lower tiers of shipping, FedEx is doing a great job saturating all of the markets that it can.This helps reiterate our long-term view on the company.The company continues to have generally positive free cash flow between $50 to $500 million per quarter, despite generally having one negative quarter due to the cyclical nature of the industry. The company generated $5.3 billion in operating cash flow in the last 12-month period.FDX Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe next innovation where we're going to see a race to meet the status quo is going to be in drone deliveries that are administered by shipping companies and retail sellers. One item to watch for in the next five years or so is how Federal Express is going to get themselves onto this landscape and how they are going to compete against others.From a valuation standpoint, the company remains cheap. FDX is currently now only trading at 11x next year's estimates and 0.85x sales. The company has about $3.5 billion in cash with about $7.26 billion in debt. Despite this, FDX has a book value of about $54.12. With an EV/revenue of 0.93x and a price/book of 2.6x and a balance sheet that's in decent shape, we still think there's value in FDX.Federal Express has carved out its own small section of the shipping industry to have as its own. While your Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchases may arrive from UPS and the US Postal Service, FedEx is starting to gain ground.With the TNT merger closing, we remain bullish on Federal Express."
3535846,32711,2015-09-27T06:04:33-04:00,"FedEx surprised analysts with a guidance cut.At the same time, volume growth is looking sluggish in most segments.With tempered expectations for global growth possibly hitting revenue growth, FedEx doesn't look very attractive to me at the moment.","Given the explosive growth in e-commerce sales, one would imagine that shipping companies would be growing revenue at a good clip. To some degree, this is the case. However, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) seems to be battling rather sluggish volume growth at the moment. Freight especially is problematic, as global growth seems to be settling into a slower 'new normal'. Although Ground is still holding up well, I would not be a buyer of FedEx at current levels, given the lowered guidance and weak volume growth.Segment overviewFedEx, due to its size, is generally regarded as a bellwether for global demand. Judging by the company's latest earnings report, things seem to be slowing down. Revenue was basically flat in the Freight segment compared to last year, as volume came in lower than expected. Meanwhile, operating income fell 21% mainly due to higher employee compensation.Although Freight only accounts for around 13% of the company's overall revenue, the stagnant performance in the segment bodes poorly for both the company's future growth prospects and global growth, as demand for Freight generally signals economic expansion.Freight wasn't the only segment that saw weakness in demand. More worryingly, Express, which is good for more than half of the company's overall top line, posted a 4% decline in revenue, as US domestic volume was essentially stagnant with a 1% increase. While International Economy volume was up 4%, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences towards cheaper shipping, the same trend led to a 5% decline in International Priority.As usual, Ground was the star performer with a 29% increase in revenue, aided by the inclusion of GENCO. Volume was up a less than stellar 4% however, and operating income and operating margin both saw declines partly as a result of higher than expected costs and higher self-insurance reserves.Judging by these numbers, and looking at volume especially, we can see that FedEx isn't exactly firing on all cylinders. Indeed, despite the fact that the holiday season is around the corner, and planned rate hikes averaging at 4.9%, the shipping giant lowered its full-year guidance.Looking aheadVersus a previous range of $10.60 to $11.10 per share, the company now expects to make between $10.40 and $10.90 for the full-year, coming in at the lower end of the $10.82 analyst consensus. At the midpoint, this would still imply fairly impressive EPS growth.However, the lowered guidance is somewhat surprising for several reasons. First of all, the number of extra holiday workers FedEx plans to take only about 5,000 more than last year, which shouldn't cause too much of a surge in costs. Secondly, the rate hike combined with the higher surcharge on large ground shipping items should boost the company's earnings potential, which doesn't seem to be reflected in this guidance cut. As such, it seems volume is expected to remain pressured for the rest of the year, which is a bad sign.ConclusionRegarded as a bellwether for global economic growth, FedEx' results are generally closely watched. Although the company is still posting solid earnings growth, even with lowered guidance, I am worried about the stagnation in volume FedEx is seeing in several of its operating segments. The weakness in Express is especially worrying, given the size of its contribution to the overall top line, and the company's guidance for the year implies that this weakness will continue. At the moment, I am not a buyer of FedEx for these reasons."
3516826,70965,2015-09-17T09:08:19-04:00,"FedEx missed earnings yesterday and lowered its full year outlook.
        We think the ensuing dip in shares represents attractive entry spots, and we'll consider adding FDX on the way down.
        We continue to believe FedEx will eventually find itself above $200, and we're long term bulls.","By Parke ShallDo we think that Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) is starting to make fools of us? It has been two earnings reports that have gone by where we have recommended the stock into the report, and the report has failed to impress the street. Believe it or not, we don't see this as a bad thing, as our bullishness on Federal Express is for the long term, and short-term pullbacks in the share price appear to us as buying opportunities.We see this as just a small bump in the road for FDX, which should eventually continue its move upward.FDX data by YChartsFederal Express reported earnings yesterday that came in under analysts expectations, and the company subsequently saw its stock decline over 3% in normal trading yesterday. In addition to missing current quarter estimates, the company provided outlook for the full year that did not impress the street. Here's a look at the company's report from yesterday, as CNBC reported,The company's estimates had been calling for $2.45 in EPS this quarter, compared to $2.10 one year ago. The company was expected to post $12.3 billion in revenue, versus $11.68 billion in revenue the year prior. The company was on track, up until this week, to hit it's guidance of $10.83 per share this year, and estimates that were calling for $12.44 per share next fiscal year have already come down to about $12.39. This still gives the company an extremely attractive valuation.Ultimately, we think that this selloff represents a longer-term buying opportunity for those that are looking to get exposure to the shipping industry and are looking for a company with a yield, even though Federal Express' yield is on the smaller side of most dividend stocks.One of the main reasons that the company had such trouble in its current quarter was that express shipping was down year over year as the company saw it its ground offering gain more traction. We don't necessarily see this as a negative, as part of what FedEx has been trying to do is expose itself to shipping that is a product of online shopping. Ground shipping is the best way to do this. In that respect, we're not overly disappointed.The industry as a whole, we believe, should continue to have nominal growth as the US Postal Service continues to struggle meeting it's targets and utilizing its budget appropriately. As the Postal Service continues to languish, we expect nominal ticks up in shippers like Federal Express and UPS.From a valuation standpoint, Federal Express continues to look attractive even though its share price has dipped slightly here. The Dow and S&P average heading into last months turmoil was that companies were sitting near 18 times earnings estimates for the coming year. This chart shows FDX at 16.7x forward earnings; based on our calculations of next year's earnings, we show it closer to 12x.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsEven with Federal Express' lowered guidance, the company is now sitting around 12 times next year's earnings. If you are a long-term investor like us, and you see the long-term outlook for FDX and the shipping industry as positive, getting the stock at 12 times next year's earnings should seem relatively attractive.The company continues to have generally positive free cash flow between $50 to $500 million per quarter, despite generally having one negative quarter due to the cyclical nature of the industry. The company generated $5.3 billion in operating cash flow in the last 12 month period.FDX Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe next innovation where we're going to see a race to meet the status quo is going to be in drone deliveries that are administered by shipping companies and retail sellers.

While your Amazon purchases may arrive from UPS and the US Postal Service, Fed Ex is starting to gain ground.In addition, the corporate world utilizes Federal Express predominately due to the company's reputation for being on time with express packages when it counts. The company's small diversification internationally and into retail with their Fed Ex office stores give them another leg to stand on in addition to shipping.To conclude, at this valuation, in a market environment where stock pickers are going to be more skeptical about valuation with the Federal Reserve in focus, we think yesterday selloff is a fine long term entry point, and will watch for any subsequent larger market selloffs that may continue to bring FedEx is priced lower to add."
3524126,24663,2015-09-21T11:43:20-04:00,FDX's recent stock loss may look like an entry point but it's misleading.FDX lacks the dividend yield needed to substitute for decelerated growth.FDX cannot afford to up its dividend due to high CapEx and a lack of FCF.FDX's price-to-FCF leaves a little to be desired.,"FedEx Corporation's (NYSE:FDX) stock is off 12% the last month, much of which came last week after the company's disappointing fiscal first quarter. While FedEx Ground continues to thrive, currency exchange and ongoing demand issues have weighed on its Express segment. The end result was less-than-stellar growth and conservative guidance. Albeit, FedEx did announce an increase in rates across all businesses in North America of 4.9%. While some might see this increase as an under-the-radar catalyst that can spark revenue and margin growth, it will unfortunately be of little relevance.FedEx has grown its business at an incredibly rapid and consistent pace, increasing 45% on a trailing 12-month basis since 2010. For a company that's large and well established, such growth is very impressive. However, like all large companies, eventually that growth begins to slow, and nowadays, FedEx's growth rate is becoming much more aligned with that of the global GDP. With $50 billion in revenue expected this year, FedEx's days of volume growth will likely continue to track that of economic growth.Nevertheless, FedEx's one wild card is price hikes, as it can increase its year-over-year growth by increasing the price to ship. Looking ahead, if FedEx can continue to implement such rate hikes while keeping volume growth intact, investors might be gravitated to the stock. However, after taking a closer look, many of those same investors are likely to invest elsewhere.First and foremost, FedEx might as well not pay a dividend. For a company that has $4.6 billion in operating income the last four quarters, you'd think its dividend yield would be higher than 0.66%. As companies grow more mature, dividends become imperative as a way to return capital to shareholders. FedEx has apparently missed this very important concept, and because so, many investors will avoid FDX as it continues to grow larger and become a more mature business.Lastly, and perhaps the most important reason not to own FDX, the stock is just too expensive and lacks real upside. Specifically, FedEx may have high operating margins but the fundamental problem for FedEx is that it also has huge capital expenditures that are not figured into its operating margin. CapEx is an important metric to assess in any company as it is an essential cost, thereby making free cash flow the most meaningful metric of profitability.FDX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsFedEx has free cash flow of just $789 million over the last 12 months, meaning that FDX trades at more than 50 times FCF. In comparison to other transportation leaders as seen above, FDX trades at a huge premium to its peers.In other words, FDX is too expensive and its price-to-FCF suggests that it'll be pricey for quite some time. In retrospect, FDX's limited FCF likely explains why the company does not pay a higher dividend, as it simply cannot afford to after capital expenditures. This is a trend that I don't think will change anytime soon. In essence, the expectations for faster shipping options continue to rise, with same-day delivery now becoming an option in some areas. Looking ahead to the next five years, it is possible that same-day shipping expands throughout the U.S. Meanwhile, FedEx must continue to invest in infrastructure to improve shipping times globally. Lastly, FedEx must continue to invest in new technology, perhaps even explore the idea of drones and other expensive alternatives that seem to be building momentum within the industry.Nonetheless, there are a lot of long-term questions surrounding FedEx's business, whereas the need for increased capital expenditures remains high. This removes all hope of FedEx becoming a high-yield investment at any point in the near future, and with growth decelerating significantly, it is hard to imagine FDX carrying a 50 times multiple to FCF long term. Hence, the bottom line is that there are far better places to invest than FDX, both in its own industry and throughout the market."
3450616,78265,2015-08-20T05:37:19-04:00,"FedEx generates a very low level of operating profit.In spite of this, the shares are priced for perfection. We see no catalyst on the horizon to drive operating profits higher, so we recommend avoiding these shares.We believe shares have much more downside potential than upside potential from these levels.","Shares of FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) have outperformed rival UPS since the beginning of the year. While the latter is down about 7% since January 1st, FedEx is down only about 4%. Is this a sign of relative quality? Should investors continue to expect outperformance from FedEx? We think not. We recommend investors avoid FedEx at these levels as the shares have greater downside than upside from here in our view. We go through our logic by reviewing the level of operating profit at the company. We'll also review the level of optimism embedded in price and we'll conclude by doing a more full peer comparison. We recommend investors avoid FedEx. We review our logic below.Operating YieldFor the four quarters ending May 31, 2015, FedEx managed to generate an operating yield of about 6.7%. This is well below what we consider to be a reasonable level of profitability, given all of the risks we know about (and the many we're sure we don't know about). For that reason, we believe it prudent to disqualify FedEx from further consideration.Source: FedEx 10-K, 2015A critic may complain that this is a backward looking analysis and that investors buy a future stream of cash flows and not a past series of cash flows. That's a reasonable critique as far as it goes, but it misses the point. The point of this exercise isn't to provide a history lesson about the recent profitability of a company. The point is to see how near (or far) a given company is from an acceptable level of profitability. For instance, we require a 15% operating yield from companies like FedEx, given the risks we're aware of (and many we can't be aware of). In order to be considered investment worthy, FedEx would need to massively increase operating profitability. We feel that by having a benchmark and reviewing where a given company is relative to that, we quantify our investment process and add some discipline to it.Although we've disqualified FedEx, we thought we'd continue our analysis. No one ever accused us of not being ponderous and tiresome about making similar points repeatedly in ways that bring new flavour and meaning to the word redundant. It may be hard to imagine, but the more Irish side of our partnership has been accused of ""droning on"" occasionally (often). With that out of the way, allow us to continue and talk about a few more reasons why you might want to avoid these shares.Optimism Embedded in PriceUnfortunately, investing involves more than simply examining a company. We're required to think about the behaviour of the stock that supposedly represents the fortunes of the underlying business. The trouble is that the stock can behave according to rules that don't seem immediately intuitive. We therefore need to spill some virtual ink talking about the stock as well as the business.When we think about investing in a stock, we specifically want to avoid overly optimistic assessments reflected in prices. If the market has great expectations for a company, they will bid the shares up in anticipation of great things from the company. This represents the worst possible payoff to shareholders. If management achieves the goals imposed on them by a hopeful audience, shares will likely move very little as expectations are already ""baked in."" If, as is more likely, a combination of competition, slow economic growth, government action and regulation and a host of other issues conspire to dash hopeful expectations, expectations won't be met. When that happens, the market will switch polarity quite quickly and go from being irrationally optimistic to irrationally pessimistic.One of the ways we judge the level of optimism surrounding an investment is to compare the current and the forward P/E multiples. If the forward multiple is too low, that's one sign to us that the market is too optimistic. At the moment, the P/E for FedEx is an eye watering 45.1 and the forward P/E is about 13.3. Holding all else constant, that means that the market is forecasting a growth rate in profits in the order of ~239%. We don't believe it reasonable to assume anything close to this level of growth. In fact, we believe the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour (+/- 8%). Since FedEx has generated CAGR earnings growth of (a very volatile) 9.77%, our highest expectations should be about 18%. The disconnect between the current and forward P/E is forecasting more than ten times that amount!Relativistic Nature of InvestingAlthough we think it silly to automatically compare FedEx to UPS and UPS only, we do acknowledge that investing is at heart a relativistic process. Everyone is always looking for the ""best"" possible investment. For us, best represents that combination of low price and high levels of operating profit. On that basis, we need to see how FedEx compares to its peers. When we do that, we find that FedEx is even more overpriced than UPS and generates an operating yield that is very much lower. For a more full comparison, we decided to compare FedEx with UPS, Kuehne & Nagel (OTCPK:KHNGY), and Deutsche Post (OTCPK:DPSGY).We discovered the following:Source: GurufocusConclusionIn our view, there's very little reason to invest in FedEx at these prices. The company generates a very low level of operating profit and is priced much higher than the overall market. The company appears worse than its peers on almost every measure of valuation and quality. Additionally, the shares are priced for perfection. We recommend that investors avoid shares of FedEx because they represent more downside than upside in our view."
3415446,36431,2015-08-07T14:58:37-04:00,"FedEx has outperformed UPS so far this year.I'd argue that UPS is a superior company, looking at efficiency and profitability ratios.UPS's earnings are of higher quality than FedEx's.UPS should see better free cash flow numbers for fiscal 2015.Investors should favor UPS going forward.","Companies like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are essential in keeping business moving every day with their vital transportation services. The two competitors are similar in nature, but their share price performance has diverged year-to-date.UPS data by YChartsI'd like to move past just stock price performance, and instead examine business performance in order to determine which company would make a better investment for the long-term.Efficiency and profitability ratiosTo start things off, I pulled some numbers from Morningstar to construct the below tables.Note: FedEx's fiscal 2015 has already ended, while UPS is only half-way through it's FY2015, which explains the difference in yearly comparisons in the above chart.We can see that UPS has far superior metrics compared to FedEx, especially when looking at return on assets and return on invested capital. It should be noted, however, that UPS' return on equity numbers, while far superior to FedEx's, are also highly magnified by financial leverage (assets/equity).FedEx utilizes way less financial leverage than UPS, but I still give the upper hand to UPS when taking into account ROIC and ROA figures. I'd also like to examine UPS' unusual spike in leverage in 2014 by looking at its balance sheet a little closer.Pulling up its 2014 annual report, we can get a glimpse of UPS' shareholder's equity on the balance sheet.Due to an unusually large accumulated other comprehensive loss, we can see that equity was drained for 2014, which helps explain the large pop in financial leverage for FY2014.This reduction in equity was largely due to more short-term pension costs, and to a lesser extent, negative currency translations. Therefore, it appears that the firm isn't as leveraged financially as it initially appears to be, but it should also be noted that retained earnings did decrease year-over-year by about 17%.Evaluating earningsNext I'd like to evaluate and compare earnings quality for both UPS and FedEx.Data from Morningstar, compiled by Joseph HarryIt's evident that UPS consistently generates higher quality earnings than FedEx does, with free cash flow exceeding net income on a regular basis, despite the big drop in FCF for FY2014.Higher operating expenses in 2014 were the leading cause for the drop in UPS' EBIT and net income. Pulling up the top part of the cash flow statement from the company's 2014 annual report, we can also take a closer look at why FCF dropped as well.We can see that pension-related events were largely responsible for the ding in operating cash (along with slightly higher capex for the year), which led to the significant drop in FCF.This was likely a one-time event (or at least short-term in nature), however, and the firm has already generated almost as much free cash flow just in the first half of this year than it did in all of 2014. Net cash from operations as of June 30th sat at $4,239 (in millions).Operating income for the first half of this year is at $3,633 (in millions) and net income is at $2,256 (in millions). That's an improvement of roughly 61% for the former and 65% for the latter.Fundamentals and valuationsLooking at capital structures, we can already conclude that UPS' big spike in its debt to equity ratio probably isn't as scary as it looks at first glance, largely because of the effect of the accumulated other comprehensive loss causing a big drop in equity during 2014.UPS Debt to Equity Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsFedEx has traditionally incorporated less debt into its capital structure, however, even when we go back five years.UPS Current Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsBoth firms have ample liquidity, but UPS' current ratio has dipped recently. This appears to have been largely driven by a decrease in the company's cash pile y-o-y, along with an increase in current liabilities, but nothing too troubling.Looking at valuations, both firms have some temporary issues/one-time events that have skewed trailing EPS, so I'll look at forward earnings. Despite its share price outperformance in relation to UPS, FedEX is cheaper, trading at 15.8 times forward earnings. UPS trades at about 17.7 times forward earnings. FDX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWe can see that UPS appears cheaper than FedEx when looking at price in relation to FCF, however. Despite higher cash from operations in FY2015, FedEx also had higher CapEX, which negatively impacted FCF. Overall, free cash flow was also higher than the previous year though, and it almost matched net income for the first time in five years.UPS on the other hand had a one-time affect disrupt its CFO, and I think its free cash flow will be materially higher this year than it was for FY2014. Even with the hit it took on CFO for FY2014, we can see that FCF still exceeded net income for the year, just like it had for the previous three years.ConclusionI think UPS is a superior business compared to FedEx for a number of reasons. First of all, it's much more efficient at allocating the capital it's given by investors, judging by its superior returns on invested capital, equity, and assets. It also spins off more free cash flow, and accomplishes this by generating higher cash from operations and utilizing significantly lower Capex than its competitor, FedEx. Throw in a dividend yielding close to 3% and it's icing on the cake, considering FedEx shares yield less than 1%. For all of these reasons, I think that investors should favor UPS over FedEx going forward."
3274865,69675,2015-06-23T12:43:22-04:00,"Shares of FedEx dropped after the company missed the mark on revenue and earnings.
        While it makes sense for investors to be a bit upset, I don't believe it warrants a decline in market value for the logistics giant.
        Rather, given the company's relatively cheap share price, its strong commitment to growth, and its operating history, I believe that shares may be undervalued compared to UPS.","Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell roughly 3% on June 17th after the company broke news that both revenue and adjusted earnings failed to meet expectations. While the news certainly doesn't look positive for the logistics giant, I believe that Mr. Market is overreacting to news that is, otherwise, quite positive for the company and its current shareholders. For this reason, I'm echoing a previous article I wrote about the business, illustrating that, while the business may be growing slower than analysts have been hoping, the long-term outlook for the company, as well as rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is quite positive.A missed quarter but positive performanceFor the quarter, FedEx reported revenue of $12.1 billion. Although this represents a 2.5% increase over the $11.8 billion management reported the same quarter last year, the company's top line came in below the roughly $12.3 billion Mr. Market expected. Despite strong growth in its FedEx Ground segment, which saw sales rise 18.6% from $3.01 billion to $3.57 billion thanks not only to its purchase of GENCO, a ""reverse logistics"" firm, but also due to a 5% improvement in average daily shipping volume, the business was held back largely because of lower fuel surcharges related to a decline in oil prices.While the top line is pretty straight forward, the bottom line is a bit trickier. Technically, FedEx actually lost $895 million during the quarter compared to a gain of $780 million a year earlier. However, if you remove impairment and legal charges, as well as a $1.38 billion mark-to-market pension accounting adjustment, the business's bottom line would have come in at $753 million, which implies an adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, falling short of the $2.68 Mr. Market anticipated. This, in turn, caused the company's net income for its 2015 fiscal year to come in at $1.05 billion, handily missing the $2.32 billion reported for the company's 2014 fiscal year.FedEx looks more appealing to meFor some companies, a missed quarter can warrant a share price decline but, in the case of FedEx, I believe investors may be getting a bit trigger-happy when it comes to selling. You see, while the company did not have an ideal quarter, there are plenty of things that investors should look forward to. For starters, in spite of an earnings shortfall, the business's cash flows from operating activities came in really strong at $5.37 billion. This represents a 26.1% increase over the $4.26 billion FedEx reported in 2014 and is higher still than the $4.04 billion seen just four years earlier.Add to this the fact that revenue over the past five years is up 20.9% from $39.30 billion to $47.50 billion and it's hard to be pessimistic about the company. This is especially true when you consider that rival UPS hasn't done anywhere near as well on the top line. Over a similar (not identical since both businesses have different reporting periods) timeframe, UPS's revenue rose a more modest 17.5% from $49.55 billion to $58.23 billion. Next year, FedEx hopes to continue this fast-paced growth by investing $4.6 billion in capital expenditures, which is higher than the $4.3 billion spent during fiscal 2015 and is well above the $3.5 billion spent during the company's 2014 fiscal year.FDX Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsOn top of being a good growth story despite its bulky size, FedEx still appears cheaper than UPS as of the time of this writing. Right now, investors buying into FedEx are paying a pretty high price for the business (given that it's in a low-margin industry) but, relative to UPS, it's meaningfully cheaper, with shares going for just 1.08 times revenue. In comparison, UPS is trading at a 49.3% premium to this with a price/sales ratio of 1.61.FDX PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsAn alternative way to view this is through the lens of profitability. As you can see in the graph below, shares of FedEx are going for approximately 9.52 times cash flows from operating activities, which is well below the 15.01 times operating cash flows that investors have to cough up for a share of UPS. While some investors may prefer to use a price/earnings ratio, I believe that, given the one-time expenses FedEx incurred, this would be misrepresentative of the company's true value.FDX Price to CFO Per Share (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsTakeawayThere's no doubt that Mr. Market isn't terribly pleased with FedEx but I'm having a hard time figuring out why. Yes, the business's shares are pricey on an absolute basis and it did miss forecasts but its results were pretty good, especially in terms of cash flow. Furthermore, with management dedicated to growing the business even more next year by allocating a great deal of cash into capital expenditures and with shares of the business trading lower than UPS, it's hard to see how investors couldn't be drawn more toward it than toward its rival."
3447686,76305,2015-08-18T06:51:58-04:00,We believe shares are worth at least $83 per share.FedEx enjoys numerous competitive advantages in its market.Shares appear to be overvalued at current levels.,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. They officially began operations on April 17, 1973. That night, with 389 team members and 14 small aircraft, they took off from Memphis and delivered 186 packages to 25 cities. And the rest as they say it, is history. Here is a breakdown of their current revenues:One of my favorite stories of FedEx was from Poor Charlie's Almanac, in which Charlie Munger describes it as one of his favorite case studies on incentives. Although this occurred years ago, it gives you an idea of the foundational culture of FedEx. Personally, it's one of my favorite mental models on incentives. Charlie tells the story here:In ascertaining the potential for any investment, we focus intently on price relative to value. We believe this will ultimately determine an investor's respective returns over time.So, is FedEx attractive at current levels?CONCERNSRegulatory Issues:The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) continues to be a nightmare for the US government as it continues to lose money. The government could impose added regulations in a desperate attempt to rein in competition with the USPS.Capital Intensive Business:FedEx has more than 47,500 vehicles and trailers and 647 aircraft (593 owned). Major capital investments are needed to maintain and grow sorting equipment, vehicles, aircrafts, packaging, handling, technology, and facilities. $1.6B in investments is expected for the future delivery of aircraft alone.Exposure to Inflation from Commodity Prices:The lower commodity price cycle has been beneficial to FedEx over the short term. Inflation is likely to increase in the future. This will have an impact on earnings as a result. FedEx has done a fairly good job in the past and has shown the potential for pricing power when it adds fuel surcharges because of increased input prices or a decrease in demand.Shipping Drones are a Disruptive Technology that FedEx Should Continue to Develop:During our competitive analysis research, we try to pinpoint potential disruptive technologies to a company's competitive advantage. Although it appears to be years away, drones would certainly fit that description. Drone technology is still in its infancy, and we acknowledge that FedEx is investing R&D into this disruptive technology (which is a good sign, long term).We expect FedEx will be able to acquire or develop such technologies as they become accepted and/or functional in the shipping industry. Albeit controversial, FedEx's brand name can play a pivotal role in the transition to drone technology in the future. See an interesting article here on the topic.INVESTMENT OVERVIEWLargest Express Transportation Company in the World Provides Significant Brand Recognition, Pricing Power, and Scale:FedEx's transportation infrastructure with worldwide brand recognition provides a significant competitive advantage. It serves markets that comprise of more than 90% of the world's GDP and their Express product is a popular feature and gives certain deliveries within 1-3 days. In addition, the US Ground segment has a stranglehold on ground transport, which is a main profit driver.Continued e-commerce and global trade growth should give FedEx a long wave of demand growth for shipping. UPS and DHL are their main competitors, but, as we can see based on margins and revenue, they have a difficult time competing with FedEx. They were recently recognized again as one of the world's 10 most admired companies and No. 1 in the delivery industry by Fortune magazine.See growing market shares below.Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) is an essential component of the supply chain. The industry continues to grow to record highs since the 2009 Great Recession. FedEx continues to gain market share in the LTL industry. See below.Growth Projections from Management Seem Attainable:Management seems intent on hitting 10%+ operating margins, 10%+ EPS, greater cash flow, and increases in ROIC and dividends well into the foreseeable future. Operating margins have grown from 7.8% in 2013 to 9.0% in 2015. Management expects to attain 10% margin on an ongoing basis. It seems they will be able to hit their target in 2016 and beyond.We know FedEx is in a very capital intensive industry. While the gap between cost of capital and return on invested capital is relatively small, they've continued to deliver value to shareholders. See figure below.International Expansion Should Be a Major Driver of Future Growth:FedEx's main motivation for opening the most advanced FedEx distribution center in Mexico City is to provide a blueprint and driving force for the acquisition of companies in other key markets, such as the UK, India, Hungary, Poland, France, Brazil, Southern Africa, and China. International growth has more than doubled from $653M in 2011 to $1.4B in 2014. This continued growth should be a major driver of growth in the future for FedEx.Management is Highly Capable and Shareholder Friendly:Co-founder and CEO, Fred Smith continues to lead this $45B global transportation, business services, and logistics company since its founding in 1971. He is plenty capable and owns 5.45% of the shares outstanding. Overall, management has returned $6.5B to shareholders since 2014. Dividends have increased every year since 2005.VALUATIONOn the valuation front, FedEx sports a P/FCF of 46.17 (FCF yield of 2.17%), EV/EBIT of 27.56, forward P/E of 15.02, P/S of 1.00, and a dividend yield of 0.52%.The future is inherently unknown and unpredictable (to any high degree of probability). Because we weren't blessed with a crystal ball, we believe a margin of safety is ESSENTIAL in every investment.A larger margin of safety is recommended for lower quality investments (larger discount between current prices and the Intrinsic Value of the Business). A higher quality business or investment doesn't necessary require a large discount to intrinsic value if you expect (with a high degree of probability) that returns will be realized shortly or returns of the business will compound over time.In regards to valuation, margin of safety can be accomplished in one of two ways (or both for that matter):1) Purchasing the conservative estimate of future free cash flows of the business at a discount2) Purchasing a business below its liquidation value with favorable earnings power in 3-5 years.In the case of FedEx, we will be valuing the business based on its discounted future free cash flows to determine if there is a margin of safety.In valuing any business, it's important to focus on free cash flow (as well as the durability of its competitive position).In valuing FedEx, let's start with the FCF number.FedEx had cash flow from operations of $5.37B in fiscal year 2015. Capital expenditures for the year were $4.35B. The ""back of the envelope"" net free cash flow was about $1.02B.From 2007 to 2012, FCF grew on average 4.2%. And from 2010 to 2015, FCF grew on average of 25.9%. And in the process, FedEx has usually grown earnings while achieving high-single digit to mid-teen returns in ROE and ROIC over the last 10 years.It appears Capex is increasing slightly, because of recent investments in FedEx Ground and purchasing of aircraft. However, we expect this to come down over time and in-line with a percentage of revenue.FedEx operates in a cyclical industry. Although the company has a much larger moat compared to other business competitors, it's still subject to the wide vagaries of market cycles at times. As a result, we will use a shorter-term average of free cash flow (3 year). However, we expect this number to be much higher over time. We will use a conservative discount rate of 9% given the high quality nature of the business.And even after all the DCF projections, the business is still worth something at the end of the day (all else being equal). So we assume that the business is sold at the end of year 10 at a conservative 10x FCF plus any excess capital in the business. FedEx has $3.8B in cash according to TTM figures, so we'll use this as a conservative number of excess capital.We assume the company will continue to repurchase shares at these levels, but in staying conservative with our assumptions, we'll use current shares outstanding of 284M in our calculation.Based on these numbers, and to be very conservative, I will come up with 3 growth scenarios for FedEx over the next 10 years. We'll also give a probability weight based on the likelihood of each scenario. Let's look at the three scenarios below using these various assumptions, and see how we were able to arrive at a fairly conservative estimate of intrinsic value using a range of values and probability of the scenarios playing out:Low-Range Scenario #1: 5% growth in FCF for years 1-10Mid-Range Scenario #2: 5% growth in FCF for years 1-5, 10% growth in FCF for years 6-10High-Range Scenario #3: 10% growth in FCF for years 1-10The intrinsic values of FedEx range from $64.84 to $83.44. The stock is trading ~$163 per share which gives very little margin of safety to our high-line assumptions. However, we do believe the most likely scenario is 10%+ growth in FCF in the foreseeable future, which is why we weighted scenario #2 and #3 at 40% probability each. So the true intrinsic value is likely much higher than our estimates.This gives us a weighted intrinsic value of $75.50 per share. With shares trading at more than $163 per share, it seems like there could be better opportunities.BOTTOM LINEExpress, Ground, and Freight segments all saw increases in operating margins over the year and executed on profit improvement goals. The company repurchased almost 10% of its shares and continued to further grow market share in the growing Ground segment, which should provide for future value in shares. The expansion of CapEx and the acquisition of Genco weighed on cash flow over the last few quarters, but it should provide future benefits with a growing US economy and lower fuel prices.Overall, FedEx has a very wide moat in the transportation industry and it's an extremely high quality company. However, even the greatest business in the world can be a bad investment if purchased at too high a price.Shares appear to be overvalued at current levels, but the competitive position FedEx holds should allow the company to compound returns well into the future. In our humble opinion, this is a buy on pullbacks and/or exogenous events.Notable Shareholders:CEO Fred Smith | Southeastern | PRIMECAP | GreenhavenSource of above figures: Company Presentation, 2014 Annual Report"
3510436,32001,2015-09-15T04:32:40-04:00,"FedEx looks cheap on a PEG basis, expecting mid-double digit growth and trading at 13-14(x) earnings.The company's valuation is at a discount to intrinsic value, just not a large discount.The GENCO and TNT acquisitions are critical for the company's operating leverage: FedEx's capex as a percentage of cash flow is 80%, which is pretty steep.An industrial with such operating leverage means that small changes in revenue can mean big changes to EPS. A China update on the call could weigh greatly.The stock was oversold on Monday, Sept 15, down from $185 to the mid-$140s, as it was in 2011.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX), the iconic overnight delivery business, reports its fiscal Q1 '16 financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday morning, September 16, 2015.The stock is down from its June high near $185, trading near the mid-$140s on Monday (as this is being written), having taken a beat-down with the S&P 500's correction and the Transport worries, not to mention cautious guidance for Q1 '16 with the May '15, fiscal Q4 '15 report.Consensus analyst expectations for Q1 '16 are for $2.45 in earnings per share (EPS) on $12.23 billion in revenue, for expected year-over-year growth of 17% and 5%, respectively.FDX management guided weakly for fiscal Q1 '16, which it typically does anyway.Fiscal 2016 full-year expectations are looking for 21% EPS growth on 6% revenue growth, which isn't too shabby relative to the rest of the S&P 500. You have to look in the tech and healthcare sectors to find anything close to 21% expected EPS growth this year.So, why is the stock down $40 per share since the June '15 peak near $185?Nirvana for FDX is a declining jet fuel price, with improving stock volumes across Express, Ground and Freight. Its margins have benefitted from the rapid fall in crude oil prices over the last year (FDX's fuel expense has fallen from 10% of revenue two years ago to just 6% today, which might not sound like much, but in dollars is a savings of roughly $300-400 million per quarter, or $1.00 to $1.40 in EPS accretion), but the stock price could be discounting softer US, European and Chinese volumes.That discounting could be overdone.Bigger-picture perspectiveVolume growth at FedEx Express, the transport giant's biggest segment at 55% of revenues and about half of FDX's 10% operating margin, has been slowly declining for years. Ground has been a stalwart since the early 2000s, when it launched. Freight had some issues the last few years, but the operating margin and profitability have been restored.The company went through a headcount reduction the last few years, and also issued debt to repurchase stock, so like the best of the tech universe, even staid ol' FDX did a little financial engineering to benefit shareholders.Europe's TNT acquisition, which hasn't closed yet and will cost US $4.4 billion, was brilliantly timed, since the acquisition was announced near the peak of the 6-month, 22% ramp in the US dollar which culminated in Spring '15.The TNT and last year's GENCO acquisition will likely be ""synergistic deals"" from an expense standpoint.The plunge in the price of crude oil in the last 12 months makes for big savings for FedEx, as articulated above. The company's operating margin hit 10% in Q4 '15 for the first time since Q4 '14, and before that, it was in May '07.The business modelThe big issue with FedEx, in my opinion, is the degree to which ""capex"" consumes cash flow. At 80% of operating cash flow, the company doesn't have a lot of room for error; thus, I do suspect the TNT acquisition, which will give FDX the European footprint and scale it needs, will bring additional volume at the same fixed costs.The GENCO acquisition cost $1.4 billion, which was added to FedEx's capex, and the TNT acquisition will essentially cost the company a full extra year of capex spending.In the slow, ""global growth"" environment that the world's major economies has been locked in since 2008-2009, it has been a tougher world for FDX to drive revenue growth and volume growth. Hence, the headcount reductions and the drop in crude oil prices have helped immensely.Conclusion / SummaryAt 10(x) cash flow and expecting to grow 15-20% in fiscal '16, with a 13(x) P/E ratio, the stock was bought for clients in small quantities on Monday, after being out of the stock for a while.Here is the Q4 '15 earnings preview on FDX, which addresses many of the same issues, but at that time, the stock was the only Transport member showing any relative strength, and very little of FDX was held for clients.Here is the March '15 earnings preview, where we had exited the stock after deciding low oil prices and the share repo plan had been fully discounted in the stock price.There has been very little erosion in the forward EPS and revenue estimates for FDX for fiscal '16, '17 and '18.Something has it wrong: Either the stock down at $145 is too cheap, or we are closer to a global recession than is more widely suspected. Fred Smith usually comments on China and such on the call; thus, whatever FDX management says about China will likely have great import, given their visibility into the country.Technically, with the drop to the mid-$140s from June's $185 high, FDX is as oversold today as it was in August-September, 2011.Remember too, stocks that are trading at a 25% perceived discount to fair value or intrinsic value can drop to 40% (or more) too, particularly in these markets. FDX's 200-week moving average is all the way down at $125."
3500876,70965,2015-09-10T03:00:20-04:00,"We have a long term outlook on FedEx, which we think in the short term can head back over $200.
        The company reports next week on September 14th.
        The company’s estimates are calling for $2.45 in EPS this quarter.","By Parke ShallA longtime favorite of ours, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) will be reporting next week on September 14th. We think the stock is a buy into the report. We've been looking at the company's dip in shares over the last 3 month period as an opportunity to buy for those that are focused on the company's performance over the long term. We plan on adding FedEx at some point in the next 72 hours, depending on when funds are allocated.FDX data by YChartsThe company's estimates are calling for $2.45 in EPS this quarter, compared to $2.10 one year ago. The company is expected to post $12.3 billion in revenue, versus $11.68 billion in revenue the year prior. The company is on track to hit it's guidance of $10.83 per share this year, and estimates are calling for $12.44 per share next fiscal year.Applying a modest 15-18x P/E to next year's earnings says to us that shares will eventually wind up over $200. Those with a long-term focus, we believe, could DRIP shares from the company's nominal dividend and hold on for the ride.Again, let's compare UPS to FedEx in terms of multiple the market is assigning to each company. The market's recent turmoil has sent FDX down to a P/E of just 12-14 compared to competitor UPS at 18.FDX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIn addition Citi added FedEx (FDX) to its recommended list of stocks during the first week of September.We're going to be looking for several items this quarter. First, will the company's margins reflect e-commerce volumes and pricing shifts?We also want to know how much is left to be done with the TNT merger. How have the details of the TNT express merger panned out and what do the synergies mean for the bottom line? Can the company offer us further guidance into how this merger is going to be accretive and affect FDX holders.Finally, does the company have any plans to hedge against an oil market that looks like it may have bottomed? What will fuel costs rising mean for the company's expenses?Cash flow and operational performance of the company continues to look great.FDX Cash from Operations (Quarterly) data by YChartsGoing forward, the company now only trades at 12.32x its forward estimates and has a modest 0.91x price to sales and 2.8x price to book ratio. With a secure balance sheet, plenty of cash on hand to keep operating with, and $5.3 billion in operating cash flow from the trailing twelve-month period, FedEx stands to be in good shape moving forward.Considering that we believe FDX's growth prospects have never been more promising, we find that the multiple here has plenty of room to expand. For example, the S&P average of 15-18 times earnings would put FDX at about $200-225/share. We see no reason to discount the multiple here as we think the company's business and cash flow both remain very real.We think those with a long-term focus will look at today's pricing as an opportunity and we like FedEx into next week's earnings. We may buy FDX in the next 72 hours."
3460926,52212,2015-08-25T07:37:46-04:00,"In this article, I will review the stocks United Parcel Service and FedEx to determine which is currently the best long-term buy.I will examine each stock's value as a stable, growth, value, and defensive investment based on a wide number of metrics.The results of this analysis lead me to believe that United Parcel Service is currently the better long term investment option; however, I consider both stocks to currently be Holds.","OverviewIn this article, I will be taking a look at both United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to help determine which is the better long term investment for specific types of investors based on a variety of metrics. In doing so, I will be reviewing each stock based on the following characteristics:Since all investors are not the same, I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks. In my review, I will be comparing the two stocks on individual metrics, and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category.STABILITYThe purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position, possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value.Return on AssetsUPS currently has a significantly higher return on assets compared to FedEx based on trailing twelve months. UPS has a value of 10.85% while FedEx has a value of 3.06%.Return on Invested CapitalJust as with ROA, UPS holds a large advantage in terms of ROIC as well. Its value of 25.04% is far greater than the 4.97% value that FedEx currently holds.Earnings YieldUPS also holds the higher earnings yield between the two companies with a value of 4.32% compared to 2.29% for FedEx. Looking at the chart below, you can see that a significant recent drop in earnings yield for FedEx allowed UPS to gain the advantage for this metric.UPS Earnings Yield (TTM) data by YChartsBook ValueOver the past five years, UPS has seen a significant decline in its book value per share, while the book value for FedEx has remained fairly stable.UPS Book Value (Per Share) data by YChartsOutstanding SharesBoth companies have been able to reduce their number of outstanding shares over the past five years and both at nearly identical levels. UPS has seen a 9.38% decline in its outstanding shares, while FedEx has seen a 10.30% decline.SummaryWith far higher returns on assets and invested capital along with a higher earnings yield, I feel that UPS is the clear winner of the stability section.GROWTHThe purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future.Revenue GrowthWhile both companies have seen similar trends in revenue growth over the past ten years, FedEx has seen the stronger overall growth rate.UPS Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsEarnings GrowthThe earnings growth of both companies has been very sporadic over the past ten years, with FedEx seeing an overall decline in its earnings, while UPS has seen a rise in its earnings during this time period.UPS EPS Basic (TTM) data by YChartsProfit MarginUPS has a higher profit margin value of 6.73% compared to FedEx and its 2.21% profit margin. The profit margin of both companies has fallen significantly compared to ten years ago.Return On EquityUPS easily outperforms FedEx in this category with a ROE of 114.60% compared to 6.82%. Looking at the chart below, you can see that UPS has also done a better job of increasing its ROE over the past several years.UPS Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsStock Price GrowthFedEx has seen the higher growth in its stock price over the past ten years, gaining 84% compared to 39% for UPS. Looking at the chart below, you can see that FedEx outperformed the market in general (S&P 500), while UPS underperformed.UPS data by YChartsSummaryWhile FedEx did have the stronger revenue growth and higher stock price appreciation, I feel that UPS was still the winner in the growth category. The fact that it increased its earnings significantly, while FedEx actually saw a decline in earnings is a big factor. Stronger ROE and profit margin also adds to UPS' performance, but the deciding factor for me was that while FedEx strongly outperformed UPS in terms of stock price appreciation, when looking at overall returns, the difference was not nearly as significant.UPS Total Return Price data by YChartsVALUEThe purpose of this category is to judge each stock's current value to determine which one is more attractively priced.PE ratiosUPS has a lower trailing PE ratio of 23.14x compared to the high PE ratio of 43.64x for FedEx. When looking at forward PE ratios, it is UPS with the higher value of 18.81x compared to 14.41x for FedEx.PEG ratiosWhen looking at trailing PEG ratios, FedEx has a significantly lower value of 0.23x compared to 2.20x for UPS. FedEx continues to have the lower value when looking at forward PE ratios as well. FedEx's value of 0.07x is more attractive than UPS' 0.31x value.Price to Book ValueWhen looking at this measure, UPS appears greatly overvalued with a value of 45.56x while FedEx looks to be more attractively valued with a 2.94x price to book value.Price to Free Cash Flow ValueFor this metric, it is FedEx that appears overvalued with a value of 43.91x compared to 16.02x for UPS.SummaryWhile this category was a close call, I feel that FedEx slightly edged out a victory. While FedEx did have the higher price to free cash flow and trailing PE ratios, the fact that it had the lower forward PE and PEG ratios, along with its far lower price to book value, was enough for me to consider it slightly more attractive based on valuation compared to UPS.DEFENSEThe purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession. I will be looking at both dividends and past performance to score this.Dividend HistoryUPS has and continues to pay a significantly higher dividend yield than FedEx with a 2.88% yield compared to 0.54% for FedEx. However, FedEx has increased its dividend at a higher growth rate than UPS over the past ten years.UPS Dividend data by YChartsPrice Returns During Prior RecessionsDuring the 2007-09 recession, both companies saw a significant drop in its stock price, but UPS was able to outperform the market in general (S&P 500), while FedEx underperformed.UPS data by YChartsDuring the 2001 recession, both companies outperformed the S&P 500, but only FedEx saw its stock price increase during that stretch.UPS data by YChartsSummaryI wouldn't consider either of these stocks, strong defensive investment options. While FedEx was able to see its stock price increase during the 2001 recession, it underperformed the S&P 500 and UPS during the most recent one. FedEx has seen significant dividend growth over the past several years; however, its low dividend yield prevents the dividend from being much of a factor in terms of protecting against stock price loss.ConclusionI believe that both stocks should currently be considered holds. I don't believe that either company is performing at a level that would warrant a sell recommendation, but I also don't feel like either of these should be considered buys at the moment.In terms of stability and growth, UPS does have an edge, but the company appears overvalued, based on forward ratio comparison with FedEx as well as historical comparisons of its own valuation. The stock's price to book value is very high and close to a 10-year high.While FedEx does seem more attractively priced, down significantly from its 52 week high of $185.19, I feel that FedEx remains a sensitive stock with more downside risk than upside potential. I do feel that the company's merger with TNT Express will provide a significant pop to its stock, assuming it goes through as planned, but with a low profit margin and declining earnings over the past ten years, it remains a stock that I cannot recommend.If I already owned either stock, I probably wouldn't be selling at these prices, but I wouldn't be buying either. If I did have to choose between the two, I would give the edge to UPS due to its stronger earnings, cash flow, returns, and overall financial position. As always, I suggest individual investors perform their own research before making any investment decisions."
3266495,73185,2015-06-18T01:56:57-04:00,"We are seeing a consumer priority shift from speed to quality in the shipping market, and believe this shift could yield mixed results for FedEx.
        We believe increased fuel expenses, stagnated revenue, and increased competition should partially offset margin growth from Expense cost-cutting program expected to yield results in the back half of fiscal 2016.
        While new-age competitors like Amazon do not pose elimination threats to FedEx, they do present urban competition, which could adversely effect top and bottom line.
        We believe FedEx is a Hold and have a $179 price target on the stock, with speculative upside potential from successful European market transition with TNT Express acquisition.","We are initiating coverage on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) with a $179 1-year Price Target and a 'Hold' rating. We believe that while margins will benefit from FedEx's cost-cutting strategies and share buyback programs, this growth will be offset by a shifting consumer priority. Several threats are rising in the e-commerce business, including Amazon, which concern us about healthy topline growth.There has been a clear shift in consumer priority from speed to quality, as Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY. We believe this shift will accelerate given the existence of convenient speed-substitutes.While margins will improve due to an Express cost-savings plan to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, we feel these improvements will be mitigated by stagnated revenue and increased fuel costs.Furthermore, while we do not believe Amazon poses a risk to FedEx as a whole business, we do believe Amazon adds legitimate competition to FedEx is select urban areas.Based on our fair net present value calculation, FDX is currently trading at 9x EBITDA and 19x earnings, which we feel are fair multiples for a mature company with low-growth prospects and intense competition.Consumer Priority ShiftSales trends are illustrating a shift in FedEx's consumers' priority from speed to quality, and we believe this trend aligns appropriately with macro drivers. Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years, while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years.This trend makes sense to us, and we expect to see it continue in the foreseeable future. We believe the value of ""speed-mail"" lies in, as the name implies, the quickness with which something can be delivered. As far as letters and personal mail are concerned, the value offered by ""speed-mail"" can be offered via electronic messages. As far as packages and other deliveries are concerned, the value offered by ""speed-mail"" cannot be offered via electronic messages; however, we feel that a new dimension-based pricing model will continue to steer consumers to the cheaper Ground alternative.This trend was emphasized in Fiscal 2015, especially Q4, which saw Ground revenues and Freight revenues grow 19% and 10% YoY, while the faltering Express segment accelerated its downward YoY sales trend to -19% YoY.Mitigated Cost-CuttingWe can see that the Express cost-cutting plan is a necessary for the business moving forward, as Express operating margins lag noticeably behind Freight operating margins and lag dramatically behind Ground operating margins.We also feel, however, that this cost-cutting plan will only marginally widen margins, given the declining Express sales trend described above. We do, however, believe Express revenues will be helped FedEx's acquisition of TNT; this revenue boost is already accounted for in our model and in management guidance, which our forecast falls in.It is also important to note that margins in each quarter throughout Fiscal 2015 were skewed by low fuel prices. While oil prices may not rebound to 2013 highs, we believe oil prices will increase noticeably by the 2nd half of Oracle's Fiscal 2016, which should offset some of Express segment's margin gains.E-Commerce ThreatsIn attempts to cut operating costs and improve shipping times to customers, Amazon is investing heavily in their shipping and distribution processes. Amazon's ultimate goal is to provide same-day shipping to its customers (comparable to FedEx Express), with a focus on the ""last mile"" of a package's delivery. The company is hoping to begin drone deliveries by the end of 2017 at the latest and is exploring the development of an app that allows individuals to deliver packages, similar to Uber's business model.FedEx Vice President Mike Glenn expressed doubt towards the suggestion that Amazon poses a threat to established shipping businesses. When asked about tech companies trying to construct their own distribution networks, Glenn said: ""When you talk about the challenges of building a network, the scale, the input costs, the technology issues and the customer experience required to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors, it's a pretty tall hill to climb.""Glenn raises valid points. While Amazon could conceivably compete with FedEx in select urban settings, FedEx has significant advantages over Amazon in cities outside of Amazon's current experimental shipping operations and more suburban or rural areas. Amazon would have to invest significantly more money just to match FedEx's current shipping infrastructure, let alone FedEx's own efforts to offer wide-scale same-day shipping in the future. Furthermore, consumers are more trusting of receiving their packages from FedEx and other shipping companies, so it's probable that Amazon's proposed new shipping methods meet initial resistance in the market.On the whole, Amazon's investment in shipping and distribution should not threaten FedEx or its competitors in the shipping industry. We do feel, however, that Amazon, with its large e-commerce reach, does pose a risk to stealing market share in urban areas (city-to-city transactions).Fairly ValuedBased on our calculations, we believe FDX is currently trading at 9x NPV-future EBITDA and 18x NPV-future EPS. We like to use a multiple on the NPV of future EBITDA and earnings as we feel this appropriately accounts for the future growth prospects of the company. Important to note, though, that this subjects the model's accuracy to the accuracy of our revenue and margin forecasts.Financial ModelIn our Financial Model, we assume:Employing our 5-year FCFF Model, we arrive at a price target of $179."

Currency translation impacted revenue as did lower fuel surcharges.Reported GAAP earnings per share were at a loss of $3.16, mostly due to a previously announced change in the company's pension accounting, negatively impacting earnings $4.88 per diluted share. This is a non-cash item that will not affect employee benefits nor the company's pension plans and cash flows.Quarterly revenue rose 2.5% to $12.1 billion. Adjusted operating margin improved 0.2% to 10.5%.For the full fiscal 2015 year, total revenue was up 4.2% to $47.5 billion, and adjusted operating margin climbed more than one percentage higher, from 7.9% to 9.0%. Excluding the pension accounting change and other aircraft impairments, adjusted diluted EPS increased from $7.05 to $8.95 for the year.After earnings were released on Wednesday, the market sold FedEx shares down 3% to $176. 73. The stock is trading at 16 times fiscal 2016 forecast earnings.Earlier share price surgeAbout a week ago, FedEx Corp pushed through the $180 price level at set a new all-time high of $185.19 on June 11. The stock had tested that price level three times since last December, however each time previously the trading volume was not much higher than the 50-day average.This recent surge in share price was only slightly above average volume, so it didn't inspire me with a lot of confidence, especially just before earnings were due to come out. I'm not a momentum investor. I see volumes at peaks and troughs more as votes on whether enough investors think a stock will move into a new price range or not. In this case, it was relatively weak for crossing a previous price barrier, so I wasn't expecting much.As a value investor, I instead want to look at the assets and business to see if the company can maintain earnings growth. That is what will determine the future share price a number of years from now.FedEx is the number two company in the air delivery & freight industry by market cap, following United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Between fiscal years 2011 and 2014, the company has grown EPS about 14% annually on average.As the US economy has been improving, so has the outlook for the delivery service. Currently, FedEx operates 673 aircraft, of which 383 are jet aircraft, and its ground delivery fleet is made up of 47,900 vehicles. Since 2010, revenues have risen from a little under $35 billion to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2015. FedEx share price doubled in the last four years while its rival United Parcel Service is up only 45%. Fedex and UPS Stock Comparison ChartSource: Google FinanceAs a company, I think FedEx has three things going for it now.-- First, It has a solid plan of retiring older aircraft for new, more efficient ones will help the company reduce running costs. The company announced 15 aircraft and 21 related engines were retired in June, and will be replaced mostly by Boeing 767s. The new aircraft have improved reliability, a better fuel efficiency of about 30%, and decrease unit operating costs by at least 20%. Maintenance and fuel consumption are an air shipping business' two biggest running costs, so the savings can improve operating margins.-- Secondly, FedEx has moved decisively to increase its Europe business and establish itself as the number two player in the European delivery and transport industry by making a takeover offer for TNT Express, the third largest operator in Europe. TNT Express holds about 12% of the market and with FedEx's 5% share their combined 17% puts it just after market leader DHL (19%) and ahead of UPS (16%).I think FedEx's timing and choice were key to getting an economical deal over the line. TNT Express had slipped in earnings recently, bringing down its market value. FedEx was able to attain a cheaper takeover price than what may have been possible in the past. European economic weakness has given FedEx an acquisition discount. UPS attempted to buy TNT out for $6.8 billion several years ago, but it couldn't get regulatory approvals for the takeover.In contrast, combining FedEx's small market share with the second largest company would not greatly change the market dynamics, so regulators will have less reason to oppose the FedEx takeover on the grounds of reducing competition. That is what unseated UPS.-- The third advantage FedEx has right now is cheaper fuel costs thanks to much lower crude oil prices. Over the previous four quarters, jet fuel cost has come down considerably, creating quick cost savings. According to a company release, fuel expenses went from just under $900 million in Q3 2014 to as little $609 million in Q3 2015. It remains to be seen how long oil prices will stay comparatively low, yet the current excess crude supply continues to depress world prices.I believe these three factors can give FedEx earnings enough drive over the short term to support a higher share price. Analyst consensus projections are for EPS to rise about 21% in fiscal 2016, which seems to show good value compared to the 16 times fiscal 2016 forecast earnings multiple the stock is trading at. Based on that and the past earnings growth trends, I think FedEx would be a good stock to pick up and build a position in."
3271105,89326,2015-06-19T15:07:03-04:00,"FedEx has been performing extraordinary well in the last few years - particularly the company outperformed over the last 12 months.It has set some big operational and financial goals for the coming 5-10 years.However, FedEx's decision to acquire TNT Express appears contradictory to its own set targets.","Although FedEx (NYSE:FDX) slightly disappointed its investors with its fourth quarter fiscal 2015 (4QFY15) earnings, the stock has gained 26% in value over the last 12 months, and is definitely a top performer among its air freight and logistics peers. In the long run, the share price increased over 119% in comparison with the broader market, S&P 500 Index, performance of 92%, during the last five years. The company has set some big goals while operating in a highly competitive environment and in a mature industry.While my opinion pieces have nothing to do with the earnings release in particular, it is my interest to evaluate a company's long-term performance and its underlying operating metrics around the earnings season.FedEx Long-Term Goals:During its most recent analyst event, the Memphis-based air courier services company highlighted its two strategic decisions - to accelerate its aircraft fleet retirement to improve efficiency and to acquire TNT Express NV (ADR) (OTCPK:TNTEY) to advance its footprint in Europe. The company reiterated its long-term goals of achieving 10% plus operating margin, adding profitable revenues, targeting 10-15% annual earnings per share (EPS) growth, etc.Looking at the company's past seven years performing history, every single goal seems achievable. However, I was curious about how much value FedEx-TNT Express would add to the combined entity. The best way seemed to perform a valuation exercise of FedEx on a standalone basis, and then assess the benefits of the merger on the stock price post-fiscal 2016 (FY16). As announced in the near-past, both companies see the transaction to conclude by the first half of calendar 2016 (1HCY16).FedEx Standalone Valuation:The below table summarizes the key financial metrics of the company. Every figure is in billions of dollars, except the growth and operating margin presented in percentages, and the cash flow from operations to operating income ratio presented as a multiple.The revenue is mostly expanding in relation with the global economic growth rate, since it is rare to find global trade tracking behind the economic activity. Operating margin is advancing more than five percentage points a year, and it appears that the company will be able to meet its long-term goal of 10% plus. Net income is increasing between 10-15% ranges per annum. Effective tax rate comes in at 36.3% over the last five years, excluding the first outlier. Capital spending remains pretty much calculated with an average of 8.85% in relation with revenues. Lastly, free cash flow to firm (FCFF) has grown 12.27% per annum during the entire period.To make things simpler, I also derived a relation between cash flow from operations (CFO) and operating margin. The ratio is pretty stable between 1.17x and 1.84x with the exception of 2009 data.Source: FedEx Statistical HandbookCFO/OI ratio further declined to 1.17x during fiscal 2015. There is an explanation for this trend. Since the revenue and operating margin are continuously improving, it is difficult for the CFO to sustain its prior level. I believe that the ratio will further decline in the future. The revenues have incremented 4.24% - more than the level of global economic expansion this year.This amount of data was enough for me to go ahead with my investigation. I forecasted revenue to grow in line with IMF global economic growth projections until 2020. Operating margin is anticipated to improve at 3% per annum. The CFO/OI metric is projected to contract one hundred and fifty percentage points annually. Terminal growth for FCFF is believed to be 1.5% post-2020.A summary of key assumptions is presented here.Other relevant information regarding the weighted average cost of capital is presented as follows.The enterprise value comes in at $58.44 billion. After deducting $7.23 billion long-term debt (LTD), the equity value is $51.21 billion. With 283.76 million shares outstanding, the intrinsic value of FedEx stock is $180.47 at present. The stock, therefore, is currently trading at its fair value.The New FedEx - Post-TNT Express Acquisition:TNT Express has been facing operational and financial troubles for the past few years. Without going into deep details, I collected some basic financial data which should be helpful to value the new combined entity. The table below shows figures in billions of Euros, except for percentages and ratio.Source: Company annual reportsThe revenue is declining. However, I believe that following the merger, TNT segment also will be able to post revenue expansion in line with global economic growth. Operating margin is completely unrelated to FedEx's existing efficiency. I assume that the new company would lift this segment's operating margin to 4% - a hefty 31% advancement to TNT's operational efficiency. The CFO/OI ratio is considered as 1.34x - the average of CY11-13.FedEx will acquire TNT Express for €4.4 billion at the end of its FY16. Let's take a look at what happens to the stock price. TNT Express is considered one-seventh of the combined business, represented by its revenue share.The forward looking Euro exchange is determined by the CME traded futures for respective years.Again I have to compromise measures like interest expense stream, debt to equity ratio and WACC, which are assumed as if TNT amalgamation would have no effect on them. However, I assure readers that they are petty things in this post-merger calculation. The changes made in the ""stand alone model"" is the revenue stream addition and operating margin and CFO/IO proportionate inclusion, in FY17, whereas capital spending inclusion to acquire TNT Express in FY16. Following the merger, CapEx/Rev is adjusted proportionately.Moreover, operating cost synergies of $200 million are added in the anticipated operating income each year from FY17 and onwards. Terminal growth for FCFF is considered 1.75% in this case.The new stock value comes in at $188.32 - a gain of only $8 per share. I remind that the operational challenges at TNT Express might make it difficult for FedEx to run its operations smoothly, which could result in margin and ratio dissynergies, instead of some synergies considered here.Further, the new company might undertake accelerated capital spending to overcome the challenges, which is another factor negatively weighing on the stock. Lastly, the capital structure could also adversely change.Conclusion:Acquiring TNT Express is a bad decision on FedEx's behalf. The company said in its event meeting of May 2015 that it would go on adding profitable revenues in its fold. I consider that by undertaking the TNT Express acquisition, FedEx went against its own set goals. If the company really wanted to take over TNT, it should have bought the latter at some reasonable price, i.e. €7.5 instead of €8 per share would have made more sense. Wait for one more year, and the things will become clearer."
3245716,24491,2015-06-09T07:26:09-04:00,"FedEx plans to replace some of its legacy aircraft with Boeing 767s to improve fuel efficiency and reduce unit operating costs.With FedEx's plans to acquire TNT Express, improved margins will be increasingly beneficial as it leverages opportunities in Europe.Let's take a look at FedEx's recent investment decisions and how they affect the company's intrinsic value.","By Paul TaitFedEx (NYSE:FDX) continues to make an effort to achieve a 10% operating margin. Recently, FedEx Express has pushed to modernize its aircraft fleet to take advantage of increased fuel efficiency and lower unit operating cost in new airplanes.FedEx plans to retire many of their airplanes and accompanying engines earlier than anticipated as it continues to rationalize capacity. As of June 1, the company has permanently retired 15 aircraft and 21 engines, a move that came with a non-cash impairment charge of $246 million, recorded in May 2015. With plans to retire an additional 23 airplanes and 57 engines ahead of schedule, FedEx recorded an additional $30 million cash charge in the same month.FedEx has stated that every MD-10 airplane being replaced with a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 767 will contribute an additional ~$10 million in savings. The Boeing 767 can carry roughly the same amount of cargo as the MD-10, but it is ~30% more fuel efficient and will provide a minimum of 20% lower unit operating costs. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, FedEx Express spent ~$3.15 billion on jet fuel.Also moving the needle is FedEx's plans to acquire TNT Express (OTC:TNTEF) for €4.4 billion ($4.9 billion), a deal that is expected to close in 2016. The transaction will enable FedEx to take advantage of TNT's ground distribution in Europe while TNT will capitalize on FedEx's global network. Let's take an in-depth look at FedEx's recent performance and derive our fair value estimate.FedEx's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• For those that may not be as familiar with FedEx, the company provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. It was founded in 1971 and is based in Memphis.• We like the company's decision to acquire TNT Express, though the latter continues to struggle. FedEx will gain access to the firm's European distribution network, while TNT will be able to capitalize on FedEx's global one. Expected to close in 2016, it's a €4.4 billion deal.• An investment in FedEx is not without risks. The firm's operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities, and package-handling and sort equipment. Capital expenditures are generally 7%-9% of sales. FedEx ended fiscal 2014 with $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, however, a nice balance.• FedEx's long-term financial goals are as follows: 1) achieve 10% operating margin; 2) increase EPS 10%- 15% per year; 3) grow profitable revenue; 4) improve cash flows; 5) increase ROIC; 6) and increase the dividend. We like management's focus, especially on ROIC. Valuentum is not the only one that pays such close attention to this metric.• Global trade growth and e-commerce continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company.At FedEx, cash flow from operations decreased about 12% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 12% over the same time period. If margin improvements are realized, cash flow from operations should increase, benefiting free cash flow generation as a result.Valuation AnalysisHere we outline our valuation assumptions and arrive at our fair value estimate, the climax of our analysis. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx's shares are worth between $138-$206 each.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $172 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 25.6 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.3 times last year's EBITDA. FedEx's current stock price is ~$181 per share, slightly higher than our estimated fair value, but in-line with our fair value range.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 11.5%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $172 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $138 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $206 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $172 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $231 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $172 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.We like the direction FedEx is moving with its aircraft fleet and potential acquisition of TNT Express. Global trade growth and e-commerce will continue to drive revenue expansion at FedEx, so optimizing efficiency in the departments serving these demands when possible is ideal. The acquisition of TNT Express will give FedEx a greater hold in Europe, further extending its global network. All things considered, the firm is currently rated a 6 on the Valuentum Buying Index.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we reveal the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, in a case study of the ratings spanning September 2013 through September 2014. Higher-rated entities (6-10) have been shown to outperform lower-rated entities (1-5). Past results are not a guarantee of future performance.Relevant link"
3212286,69675,2015-05-27T15:42:33-04:00,"Currently, shares of FedEx appear to be meaningfully cheaper than UPS, its largest competitor.Common sense suggests that, when the price of shares diverge, the more expensive one should be able to justify it through operational performance.Due to FedEx's investments in capex and slim margin strategy, however, the opposite is true and it seems to come out on top of UPS in terms of growth.","When it comes to logistics companies, there really are no other meaningful plays except for United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX). As the two big fish in the industry, it's easy to arrive at these two companies for investors who want to bank on higher trade and e-commerce activity in the months and years to come, but which provider offers investors more attractive prospects moving forward?FedEx appears relatively cheaperAt this point in time, shares of FedEx look cheaper, for the most part, than shares of the company's larger rival UPS. As you can see in the graph below, FedEx is currently trading for 1.18 times revenue which means that, for every $1 in sales the company brings in, investors only have to dish out $1.18 for a slice of the pie. This is actually fairly low compared to most companies in most industries and is especially low compared to UPS, whose shares are going for 1.59 times sales, approximately 34.5% higher than what FedEx is trading for.An alternative way to view this is through the lens of earnings which, once again, reveals that FedEx offers investors a discount compared to UPS. Right now, shares of the logistics giant are trading for 25.77 times earnings. This is, in absolutely no way, cheap, but it does represent a discount compared to UPS, whose shares are trading for 30.56 times earnings. Put another way, Mr. Market is essentially saying that a dollar in earnings generated by UPS is worth about $0.19 more than it's worth for FedEx, which doesn't make much sense unless UPS can justify it through higher growth.This doesn't appear to be the caseCurrently, shares of FedEx look cheaper than shares of UPS on both the top and bottom line, which might lead some investors to say that, perhaps, UPS demands a higher premium for some reason. While the company is the larger of the two, however, that's about the only meaningful advantage it has over FedEx. As you can see in the graph below, for instance, revenue growth at FedEx has been much faster, growing by 31.2% from $34.73 billion in 2010 to $45.57 billion by the end of the company's 2014 fiscal year. UPS, on the other hand, has managed a sales increase of just 17.5% over this timeframe, rising from $49.55 billion to $58.23 billion.In addition to growing faster on the top line, FedEx has also been doing far better on the bottom line. Between 2010 and 2014, the business's net income soared a whopping 77.1% from $1.18 billion to $2.10 billion, easily surpassing UPS, whose profits actually declined by 9.2% from $3.34 billion to $3.03 billion. Interestingly, however, if you ignore net income and focus solely on operating cash flow, UPS has come in slightly ahead in recent years, with cash flows rising by 49.2% compared to FedEx's 35.7% improvement.The difference between these two entities boils down to two factors; growth initiatives and the willingness to accept lower margins. Sales of FedEx, for instance, have grown at nearly twice the rate than the sales of UPS because the management at the former believes in investing heavily in growing the corporation. In 2014 alone, FedEx spent $3.53 billion on capital expenditures, much of which has been dedicated to growing its market share at any and all costs. This compares to UPS which, while larger in overall presence, spent just $2.33 billion on capital expenditures last year. In fact, over the past five years, total capex spending at FedEx totaled $17.17 billion, easily surpassing the $9.95 billion allocated by UPS.While spending on growing your physical footprint is one part of the growth equation for a highly competitive market with slim margins, the second part is to be willing to accept lower margins now in exchange for a larger hold on the market in the future. This, too, is something that FedEx has resorted to in an attempt to grow its business. Last year, for instance, the company's net profit margin came out to just 4.6%, slightly lower than the 5.2% margin reported by UPS. Over the past five years, the average spread has been even greater, with FedEx's net profit margin coming in at just 4% compared to UPS's 5.7% margin.TakeawayCurrently, shares of FedEx appear to be cheaper than the shares of its rivals. While the company does suffer from lower margins than its peer, this has been done deliberately with the intention of using this approach to grow faster. Add to this the fact that both sales and profits have been rising at a quicker pace due, in part, to the company's hefty investment in growth, and it's clear to see that, while both businesses will likely fare well over the next couple decades, FedEx may make for the most attractive prospect for the long-term investor."
3072786,86036,2015-04-15T15:33:42-04:00,FedEx has agreed to acquire TNT Express for $4.8 billion.The acquisition will provide FedEx with solid infrastructure to grow in Europe.The timing of the deal is ideal.,"Earlier this month, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced that it has agreed to acquire Dutch parcel delivery company TNT Express (OTC:TNTEF) (OTCPK:TNTEY) in an all-cash deal, estimated at 4.4 billion euros or $4.8 billion.Now, the deal awaits a series of regulatory approvals, including antitrust clearance. Earlier in 2013, UPS (NYSE:UPS) had offered to acquire TNT for 5.2 billion euros, but the deal could not go through due to competition concerns raised by antitrust authorities. However, any hurdle is unlikely this time around as the combined market share of FedEx and TNT would be less than 30% in the European parcel delivery market.The offer, which represents a 33% premium over TNT's closing price as on April 2, 2014, might appear a bit high given the fact that TNT has been posting net losses for the last four years. Lately, TNT's financials have been weighed down by restructuring charges and sluggishness in the European economy.However, there are many positives. Firstly, TNT's vast ground and air network in Europe would offer FedEx a solid infrastructure to grow in the fast-growing e-commerce and ground parcel delivery market in Europe.TNT's European Road network will provide FedEx with more than 540 depots and 19 road hubs spread across more than 40 countries.Right now, FedEx controls only about 10% of the European Express delivery market. By acquiring TNT - which has a 12% market share - FedEx will have resources and capabilities to compete against German rival DHL. DHL has 41% market share in Europe, while UPS has a 25% market share.Likewise, TNT's ground delivery network will also help FedEx to gain a foothold in the fast-growing ground parcel delivery segment. Although FedEx has been operating 100 stations that span 11 European countries since 2011, its market share in the ground parcel delivery segment is only 2%.Integration of European Road network and Express segment should bolster FedEx's cross-border e-commerce business. Online purchases accounted for more than $1 trillion in sales in 2014 and sales are expected to double in the next four years, Forrester estimates.And of course, once the two businesses get fully integrated, it would also bring in cost synergies.But apart from FedEx's strategic move - which is to expand its foothold in Europe - what I really like is the timing of the acquisition.The U.S. dollar has been strengthening against euro. A stronger dollar helps FedEx save a lot of money as it is looking to fund the deal through its cash reserves and by utilizing existing and additional debt agreements. But more importantly, the European economy has been rebounding strongly. The European Union's (EU) composite PMI (both for service and non-service sectors) climbed to 54.1 in March - the best reading in the last four years.The marked improvement in the EU's economy comes at a time when the European Central Bank (ECB) is in the midst of a massive quantitative easing program.This development is very significant for TNT. Majority of TNT's shipments in Europe have been in the Business-to-Business (B2B) segment. The company has a customer base ranging from multinationals to small and medium scale enterprises (SME) that focus on high-tech products, industrial automotive and healthcare industries.With FedEx looking to strengthen TNT Express by increasing investment capacity and enhancing sector expertise, TNT's B2B segment will receive a boost at a time when business confidence is improving in Europe.As I noted earlier in the article, the acquisition will enable FedEx to grow its e-commerce and ground parcel delivery market in Europe. The company sees e-commerce growth as one of the facilitators of reaching its long-term financial goals of 10% operating margin and increasing earnings by 10%-15% per year. It was not surprising to see a positive reaction from FedEx's shareholders after the deal was announced. I think what makes the deal even better is a stronger dollar and an improving EU economy."

Here's what we're looking for this quarter.","By Parke ShallFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is set to report next week on Wednesday, June 17th before the market opens. We've been bullish on FedEx for years, and continue to think that the company represents a great buy and DRIP opportunity at nearly any price - with today's valuation and pricing still looking attractive, despite being aggressive. We have a long-term outlook (10 years+) for an investment in FedEx.FDX continues to perform well. It's traded up 6.1% in the last three months, 26.1% in the last 12 months, and has been up 4.7% since the beginning of 2015.FDX data by YChartsThe shipping company is expected to earn $2.68 on revenue of $12.32 billion. This compares to $2.46 in the year prior on revenue of $11.84 billion. For 2015, FDX is expected to earn $8.94 and it's expected to earn $10.87 in May 2016; estimates that we think continue to make FDX a buy at this price/valuation.Last quarter, the company narrowed its guidance but earnings improved by 53% due to FDX's continued restructuring and low fuel costs. It made for an ""easier winter"" for the company. This improvement was all on a top line that hardly grew for the company in the previous quarter. FDX had bought some employees out and continued the process of modernizing its air fleet, which it's still participating in.Here are some of the items that are in focus for us this quarter:As we continue to reiterate, FedEx has long been a favorite of ours. Our bullishness is a product of our investment horizon on FDX, which is an outlook of 15-years plus.In this article out earlier this year, we talked about why we had a $195 near-term price target on FedEx. We concluded,UPS P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsUPS continues to trade at a ttm P/E that's well above FDX. Moving forward, the gap between the two companies' forward P/E continues to close but UPS still trades at a forward multiple around 18x while FDX trades at about 16.6x estimates.Analyst consensus has also continued to support our bullishness,In addition, FDX has just increased their dividend by 25%. The company's dividend isn't anything to write home about, but is a kicker to owning the equity.FDX data by YChartsGoing forward, the company now only trades at 16.7x its forward estimates and has a modest 1.08x price to sales and 3.2x price to book ratio. With a secure balance sheet, plenty of cash on hand to keep operating with, and $4.8 billion in operating cash flow from the trailing twelve-month period, FedEx stands to be in good shape moving forward.The company has consistently grown its cash from operations in addition to its earnings.FDX Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YChartsConsidering its growth prospects have never been more promising, we find that the multiple here has plenty of room to expand. For example, the S&P average of 18 times earnings would put FDX at about $195/share. We see no reason to discount the multiple here as we think the company's business and cash flow both remain very real.Heading into earnings, we'll be looking for more color on margin and how the company could continue to improve operating efficiency to guarantee it's valued at the multiple it deserves. We remain bullish on FDX for the long term."
3228686,73645,2015-06-02T02:55:01-04:00,FedEx passes the Four Filters.It has major competitive advantages.It sells at a reasonable price.,"Introduction""I wrote a term paper for an economics class in which I simply observed that as society became more automated, companies like IBM and Xerox that sold early computer devices needed to make sure that their products were dependable. They had to be 100% reliable, or the efficacy of the device was in question."" In these words, Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO of FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) (""FedEx""), discusses the genesis of the company that has become part of our everyday lives. Let's examine FedEx using the Four Filters and determine if it is a good long-term investment (The Four Filters were discussed in my previous articles here, here, and here for reference).1. Deal in things you're capable of understandingFedEx is in the business of shipping and all things involved with the segment. FedEx deals in transportation, e-commerce, and business services. The company is organized in four segments.FedEx Express is the largest transportation express company and serves 220 countries. Its connected markets make up more than 90% of the world's GDP. This segment also deals in international trade services, customs brokerage, and freight forwarding for air and ocean. FedEx Ground provides delivery for small packages and delivers to anywhere in the U.S. and Canada. It serves nearly all residences. FedEx Freight provides large freight hauling services, either Priority-style (where speed of delivery is sacrificed for price) and Economy-style (where price is more important than speed). They deliver to Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. FedEx Services offers sales and marketing support. It also aids in customer billing and offers document and business services for package transportation through FedEx Office (which used to be Kinko's). The revenue breakdown is as follows:(Chart is made using Microsoft Excel)(FedEx has a calendar year of June-May instead of the traditional January-December, so the revenue breakdown is from June 2013-May 2014.)As described above, it is a simple business in that it deals with all aspects of transportation from delivery to freight forward to the back office and business services behind the package delivery.2. A business with characteristics that give it a durable competitive advantageFedEx has three major competitive advantages that are difficult to replicate for any new entrant. It has a huge cost barrier for entry, has a stronger network effect, and has ""mindshare"". Let's go through all of these characteristics.A network the size of FedEx has a high fixed cost structure with all its distribution centers, trucks, and planes, and it requires a lot of capital investment to continually grow. A new entrant would incur losses initially and would have to reach a large volume in order to start turning a profit. New entrants may not have the time or ability required to lose money continuously for years as the company is being built out. Additionally, as FedEx is built out, it can offer lower prices to its customers relative to new entrants that would have to charge higher rates in order to cover costs.It also has a network effect that is difficult to replicate. As the company becomes larger and can transport goods to more places, it offers the users more options and also increases the number of users who can send/receive packages. As FedEx is already in many places, a new entrant would have to catch up dramatically, which in turn would require significant capital investment. FedEx is also growing its network through its recent acquisition of TNT Express, an acquisition which will allow FedEx to grow its ground delivery business in Europe where e-commerce business is booming.""Mindshare"" is also a very important component of FedEx's competitive advantage. FedEx, for example, offers ""trust"" and ""reliability"" when customers are choosing services for their package delivery. As its competitor UPS (NYSE: UPS) found out during the holiday season of 2013, issues with timely deliveries can destroy trust and reliability as people expect packages on time. This trust and reliability can be seen by the value of the FedEx brand, which is said to be worth $4.4 billion according to Interbrand.3. A management in place with a lot of integrity and talentFred Smith is the founder, chairman, and CEO of FedEx, and he has done a remarkable job with the company since taking it public in 1971. As described in the opening paragraph of this article, he described a world in which a more automated society with expanding technology would require a better logistics system to serve the new products that were to be built and sold. He turned this idea into one of the world's largest companies. Since Mr. Smith took the company public (he has been CEO since its IPO), FedEx stock has performed stupendously and, in the last ten years, it has outperformed the S&P 500 and its largest competitor, UPS, greatly:He is also an owner-operator in that he owns 7.5% of the outstanding shares and, thus, can freely invest for the long term as he does not have to worry about losing his job. FedEx's recent purchase of TNT Express is a great example of this philosophy. While some think the company may have overpaid, they were able to expand into Europe and take over TNT's in-place infrastructure and customer base without having to build a new one out. He has also been a great capital allocator, often considering the most important job of a CEO. He has bought back stock slowly and increased the dividend continually, both shareholder-friendly actions.4. A price that makes sense and provides a ""margin of safety""(The base growth rate estimate is from analyst estimates found on Yahoo! Finance. The other growth rates are my estimates.)As seen above, the investment provides a small return in the worst-case scenario, but it offers significant upside over a long-term period.It is important to keep in mind that the valuation above is based on current data and does not reflect the extra revenue to be generated from the TNT Express acquisition once it closes.ConclusionFedEx is a great long-term holding that passes the Four Filters. Its simple business, high barriers to entry, strong management team, and reasonable valuation all make it a compelling investment. I would recommend FedEx as a long-term holding."
3060026,25120,2015-04-10T13:28:05-04:00,"FedEx makes a bold move by acquiring TNT Express.The deal allows the company to gain significant share in Europe while it will bring long-term financial benefits as well.I like the deal given the strategic and financial rationale, although the overall valuation remains a bit high for me.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is making a nice strategic move in order to boost its European business. The company is looking to acquire TNT Express (OTCPK:TNTEY). The Dutch competitor has been too small in relation to its larger US counterparts in order to compete effectively. Poor revenue and margin developments allow FedEx to acquire TNT for a favorable price.I think that the deal will offer long-term financial as well as strategic benefits. As a result I like the deal a lot, although the benefits of the acquisition will take some time to play out.Boosting Its European ExposureAfter its main rival UPS (NYSE:UPS) was not allowed to acquire Dutch-based TNT Express two years ago, FedEx has made a move to buy the company.FedEx will pay 8 euro for each share outstanding in TNT Express, thereby valuing the business at $4.8 billion. Note that TNT holds net 449 million euro in cash, lowering the effective price tag to $4.3 billion.The deal has found great support with TNT's management, board and its largest 14.7% shareholder. FedEx will use TNT to expand its European business, as the deal seems more of a strategic acquisition rather than cost saving effort. Both companies commit to growing the European base, as FedEx has promised to keep the European headquarters in the Amsterdam area.TNT has been struggling in recent years amidst fierce competition and lack of scale. With the deal, FedEx and TNT will achieve more scale in Europe which is needed given the low margin business. A deal is probably a welcome outcome for stakeholders in TNT Express. The deteriorating competitive position has raised doubts about the viability of the stand-alone business.TNT - No Short-Term ContributionTNT posted revenues of 6.7 billion euro in 2014, as revenues have fallen by 3% versus the year before. Following restructuring efforts, the company posted an operating loss of 86 million euro. Adjusted operating profits came in at 209 million euro, for margins of just 3.1%.The company generates 80% of its sales in Europe, of which roughly half in the Netherlands. TNT has a total of 58,300 workers, which means that average revenues per worker come in at around 115 thousand euro. According to FedEx's factsheet, the company employs about 326,000 workers across the globe of which little over 20,000 are in Europe. With annual sales totaling $47.1 billion, this translates into sales of $141 thousand per worker.Based on the effective $4.3 billion acquisition price, FedEx is paying just 0.6 times sales for TNT. FedEx itself is valued at roughly $56 billion at the current time. This values FedEx at 1.2 times sales which is a huge premium versus TNT. This follows the fact that FedEx is not only growing, but is also very profitable. Operating margins come in above 8% at the moment, as the company is valued at 13-14 times trailing operating profits.These margins are superior, even to the adjusted numbers of TNT. Even when looking at the adjusting operating profits, TNT is valued at roughly 18 times adjusted operating earnings.Long-Term Potential ContributionI do not forecast earnings accretion following the deal in the short run. This of course follows the fact that TNT is not really profitable at current times. Dilution will be very limited as financing costs are very close to zero. The fact is that FedEx can use its large cash balances on which it receives no interest to buy TNT. On top of that, FedEx has access to credit markets at very cheap rates.The deal allows FedEx to integrate its network with that of TNT. This of course will result in cost synergies, although these have not been specified. FedEx should be able to improve service levels to customers as well. All of this should allow the company to boost operating margins to 5% for the legacy TNT business.Assuming 5% margins on $7.3 billion in revenues, and operating profits come in at $365 million. After applying a 30% tax rate, earnings could come in at $255 million. This translates into a 17 times earnings multiple based on the $4.3 billion price tag.This just shows the potential for FedEx. If the company can improve TNT's margins to 8% which is similar to Fedex, there is much more potential. In such a scenario, earnings could come in at $400 million which combined with market equivalent multiples could result in a $7-$8 billion valuation.No Big Troubles AnticipatedCompetitor UPS tried to buy TNT two years ago to expand its operations in Europe. It was happy to spend $7 billion on TNT at the time. The fact that FedEx is able to buy the company at a much lower price now just shows the struggles which TNT is facing as a stand-alone business.The European delivery market is led by DHL, the delivery company of Deutsche Post. This German-based company holds roughly 19% of the market. Two years ago, UPS was not allowed to acquire TNT as European authorities worried about less competition.UPS now holds roughly 16% of the market, while TNT has a market share of 12%. That combination would have created a new leader in Europe. FedEx only holds an estimated 5% market share, so the proposed combination will hold 17% of the market. This would make FedEx the new number two player, just ahead of UPS.This lower combined market share and the fact that TNT is showing clear struggles to compete on its own, should be sufficient reasons for the European authorities to allow this deal to pass.Investors Like The DealShareholders of FedEx like the deal a lot. For an effective $4.3 billion purchase price, which is equivalent to 8% of its enterprise valuation, FedEx can grow its revenues by 15%.Besides this rapid expansion, FedEx can create formidable operations in Europe and thereby create a strong regional hub to drive global expansion. Shares of FedEx have risen nearly 3% in response to the news, adding roughly $1.2 billion to its market valuation. The appealing sales multiple, cheap financing and strategic rationale are all drivers behind this positive reaction.While the deal will likely work out, it will take some time. After approval of the deal which is quite likely, a long-term growth base has been established for FedEx to drive its international growth. As mentioned above, the deal could result in a few billion in incremental value creation going forwards. Key in this value creation are improvements in the margins, and to create a successful platform to drive future growth.For this reason I am quite optimistic about the deal, although I have been cautious on FedEx based on the stand-alone valuation. At 19 times forecasted earnings, the valuation is relatively ""full"". I reiterate my caution at current levels, although I am a buyer on 10-15% dips given the healthy long-term growth prospects."
3261965,80836,2015-06-16T10:08:02-04:00,"After looking at UPS, and reading the comments about pension plans and other risks, I decided to look at its competitor. FedEx has good fundamentals and a fair valuation.The company has three huge catalysts to drive it forward: international business, e-commerce and the global economic growth.Pension expenses hurt EPS and margins, but unlike others, I don't find it concerning. From my experience here in Israel, companies manage to deal with it.","IntroductionAfter looking at UPS (NYSE:UPS) and finding it to be an interesting investment prospect, I read some comments debating about whether the defined benefit pension plans that UPS offers might harm the company, and even cause bankruptcy. As I look at the package delivery sector, I decided to analyze FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and share my point of view about these pension plans, and the experience we have here in Israel.FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services. The company offers integrated business applications through its operating companies. The company is divided into four main sectors that work together in a synchronized manner. Different transportation methods are used together in order to satisfy customers with swift and reliable delivery.I believe that the company has 3 strong catalysts that will drive it forward in the years to come. The risks are not as big a threat as some might think, and FedEx may even be a more interesting opportunity than UPS. However, dividend growth investors must remember that the yield is extremely low at only 0.5%. I will try to compare the two companies.FundamentalsIt seems like FedEx has shown stronger fundamentals than UPS over the past decade. The growth rate was more compelling both on the top and bottom lines. Revenues grew from $29,363 million in 2005 to $45,567 million in 2014. This is a CAGR of almost 5% which is much faster than UPS. New operations and geographical locations helped FedEx post fair mid-single digit growth.FDX Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsUPS Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsFedEx has recorded higher EPS growth as well. This is true even if we exclude the poor 2014 EPS by UPS. FedEx managed to show higher growth by cutting costs and using its pricing power. Its EPS grew from $4.72 in 2005 to $6.75 in 2014. This is a CAGR of almost 4%. This figure may not seem very large, but it is important to remember that this period includes the recession in the U.S and Europe. The company will reveal its results for FY2015 this week, and EPS is forecasted to rise dramatically to almost $9. In addition, analysts believe that EPS will reach $11 and $12.5 in the years to come. The growth is forecasted to be faster for FedEx than for UPS.FDX EPS Diluted (Annual) data by YChartsThe dividend is a little bit tricky. The yield is very low and the growth isn't as fast as a dividend growth investor might wish for. However, a thorough look at the case might reveal an interesting opportunity. The yearly dividend payment has grown from $0.29 in 2005 to $0.65 in 2014. This is a CAGR of 8.5%, which is great. However, the current yield is extremely low at 0.5%. For me as a dividend growth investor, it is hard to initiate a position with such a low yield. If I find it attractive like Visa (NYSE:V), I will consider it. Another important aspect is the low payout ratio which is around 10%. The last two raises were substantial. FedEx grew its quarterly payments by 33% and then 25%. This new trend is very attractive for dividend investors who might consider joining the ride as the dividend climbs quickly. With the company aiming for 10%-15% of EPS growth and such a low payout ratio, the dividend can keep growing as fast as it did over the past two years.FDX Dividend data by YChartsShare buybacks are another important aspect. Usually companies that don't pay a lot of dividends tend to reward shareholders with share buybacks. FedEx managed to decrease its shares outstanding by around 10% over the past decade. The management said that the strong balance sheet will allow FedEx to keep repurchasing its shares. I believe that the slow shift from buybacks to dividends is a positive sign. UPS managed to reduce its share count even faster.However, FedEx has shown superior fundamentals over UPS. Besides reduction in its outstanding shares, FedEx shows faster growth in the top line, bottom line and dividend. With fair valuation and some growth opportunities, it might be a decent investment.ValuationThis is another win for FedEx over UPS. FedEx is trading at a cheaper valuation. The 2014 EPS shows us that FedEx trades at a much cheaper valuation than UPS, and this is due to the one time expenses that UPS had recorded in 2014. Looking forward, we see better valuations for FedEx in 2016. Therefore, I believe FedEx is trading more attractively for long-term investors.FDX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWhen comparing share prices to sales, the picture is even clearer, as FedEx is trading at just around its forecasted sales for 2016. Comparatively, UPS, which is almost 50% more expensive, is not even close. Therefore, I believe that from a valuation point of view FedEx is the more appealing investment.FDX PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIn my opinion, FedEx is fairly valued not just when compared to UPS, but also when compared to the broader market. Long-term investors might consider buying it regardless of the dividend.OpportunitiesFedEx has some similar opportunities to UPS, but I think that FedEx is more poised to grow as it has made better moves in the last several years. The first one is the growth in e-commerce. Seven months ago, the company announced that it purchased Genco and Bongo International. Both of these companies will facilitate FedEx with its e-commerce business. This move will allow FedEx to increase its volumes quicker. E-commerce, as shown in the graph below from FedEx's investor presentation, is growing much faster than retail and it is the best place for the company to grow.FedEx is also doing some major expansion geographically by enlarging its international business. The company purchased a Dutch peer for almost $5 billion. TNT, the Dutch company, was also a takeover target for UPS, but FedEx managed to complete the deal because UPS faced regulatory problems in acquiring the company. TNT will help FedEx ship larger volumes internationally. The company sees its international business as a very large earnings growth prospect.The graph above shows the growth in the retail and e-commerce sales. In addition, it also shows the GDP growth of the American economy. This growth is driven mainly by growth in private consumption. The graph below shows how well private consumption is growing in the U.S., and as people consume more, the demand for FedEx will increase. FedEx is in a great position to compete with UPS in the U.S., as its routes are many times faster as the table below shows.As all the graphs above show, and according to the IMF and the World Bank, global GDP will continue to grow. As more products are made, shipment services become even more necessary. As I explained above, FedEx is in a great position to enjoy this growth, and in my opinion, it is in a superior position to UPS.Another advantage for FedEx is the low cost of fuel which allows it to cut costs and have higher margins. In addition, the company has invested in its airplane fleets and has made it more fuel efficient. The investments in these fleets, the lower capital expenditures and lower fuel prices will all support the growth of the company's EPS.The last important point to note is the management. The company's management has set clear goals for the years to come, and they are quite impressive. These goals include a 10%-15% growth in EPS. I know it isn't a commitment, but a management that agrees to take responsibility and gives such clear goals is always worth noting. Moreover, the management made it clear that it will increase the amount of capital returned to shareholders.RisksWell, I'll start with the pensions as they were widely discussed in the comments in my previous article. I don't think that the defined benefit pension plans are as dangerous as some might think. Yet, I am not a pension actuary expert. The problem is that the company has committed to a certain return which is much higher than the zero risk returns. First of all, looking at the current liabilities, they are lower than $3 billion. The cash flow in 2014 could theoretically cover the whole pension liabilities. It is more complicated than that, but it is important to take it into the right perspective. The current liabilities are far from bringing the company close to bankruptcy.However, some might say that in the future the liabilities will grow much faster due to the inability to achieve high enough returns. Well, here I will share the experience we have here in Israel. When the interest rate environment changes or there are major actuarial changes, the pension plans are altered. For example, the returns that pensions are calculated upon are changed. Therefore, I believe that in case of an emergency the pension agreements will be changed, as retirees will prefer pension cuts over bankruptcy which would mean no pensions at all.Another risk is competition. The competition is not necessarily limited to its peers. It can come from new players that are not parcel delivery companies. One such potential player is Uber and its peers, which are already looking to allow package delivery services. Not only that, companies might start offering their own delivery methods in order to cut expenses. FedEx must be ready to compete.Another risk is connected to the economy itself. FedEx mentions it in its annual report. If fuel prices rise or the economy does not grow as fast as predicted, its operations will be affected. In addition, the board is concerned with the impact of currency exchange rates on the company's operations. It is mainly concerned with the Chinese Yuan, Brazilian Real, Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. This risk is a short term one, and it doesn't really bother me as a long-term investor.ConclusionAs I look at FedEx, I see a great business. Even better than UPS, in my opinion, and with a better valuation. The fundamentals are strong, dividend has still a lot of room to grow and the management is willing to do so. The big disadvantage is the current low yield, but FedEx offers investors the opportunity to keep benefiting from the growing dividend.The company has three major catalysts that will allow it to grow faster than its peers, and it has already done what is needed to get ready for that moment. The pension risk is overrated in my opinion, and other risks can be dealt with. To conclude, I find FedEx to be a fair investment, especially for dividend growth investors who have a very long investment horizon. If you like Visa and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), you might like FedEx as well."
3252095,32001,2015-06-11T09:22:08-04:00,"FedEx reports fiscal Q4 '15 before opening bell on June 17th, 2015.The stock has been a relative strength leader in a tough Transport Group.FedEx Express, which lagged for years, is now suddenly showing some volume growth.Share repo's and return of capital has driven much of the EPS growth .FDX 20% undervalued in my opinion, which may not be enough of a discount for l-t investors.","There are two purposes to this article on FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX), the first being to give a brief preview of FDX's fiscal Q4 '15 financial results which, according to Briefing.com, are due to be released Wednesday morning, June 17th, 2015, before the opening bell, while the 2nd reason for the article is to talk about the bigger picture changes FDX is making to the business model.Q4 '15 earnings preview: Street consensus per Thomson Reuters is looking for $2.68 in earnings per share (EPS) on $12.3 billion in revenue, for expected year-over-year (y/y) growth of 9% and 6% respectively.if consensus estimates are met, FDX will have grown EPS and revenue in fiscal '15, 31% and 5% respectively.The consensus estimates for FDX's fiscal 4th quarter have come down slightly since the last earnings report in mid-March '15, but not enough to be material.Express and Ground volumes were pretty healthy in Q3 '15 despite worries over the Us West Coast port slowdown, tough weather, and currency.FDX management guided conservatively for q4 '15 on the March '15 call. FDX management is typically VERY conservative around guidance and has a habit of UPOD'ing the Street (i.e. under-promising and over-delivering), so I'm not worried about FDX meeting consensus for the May '15 quarter.What is fiscal 2016 consensus ?For full-year fiscal '16, current consensus is expecting $10.87 in EPS on $50.6 billion in revenue for expected y/y growth of 20% and 6% respectively.What has surprised me the last few quarters in the Express segment (the Express segment is 57% of FDX's total revenue and 40% of total operating income as of fiscal Q3 '15) is the resurgence in Express volume growth and some margin expansion.For years, Express has seen volumes lag and Express operating income has been unable to leverage (i.e. grow faster) than Express revenue growth, given the high fixed costs of the business.That has not been true for FDX Ground, which is 29% of FDX's total revenue but almost 60% of operating income, and Ground is a business that only began in earnest in 2000.How FDX management is transforming the business:Here is a table of FDX's business segments by revenue and operating income percentage as of May of each of the last 4 fiscal years:FDX Business Segments by % of revenue and operating income* Source: 10-Q and earnings reports, FDX Stat Book* Note that ""Ground"" and ""Freight"" are transposed between Revenue and Operating IncomeReaders can see that while Ground has leveraged its revenue growth, Express and Freight have not, but both are in the process of improving their operating margins and hence operating income.Don't kid yourself: FDX is another ""capital intensive"" business. here is a brief history of FDX's capex as a function of FDX's cash-flow:FDX's capex as a percentage of operating cash-flowSource: internal spreadsheet from 10-Q's and earnings reportsTo be honest, our recent article on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) here, among several written about Intel's capex burden, FDX makes Intel look like a software or large-cap pharma company.I don't know too many businesses that have a 60% - 70% cash-flow reinvestment requirement in their core business. That being said, from a competitive strategy perspective, FDX has global scale and reach and has Express (NYSE:AIR), Ground and Freight segments, across the delivery spectrums.According to the Q2 '15, Stat Book, FDX has 673 airplanes as of Q2 '15 and the recent company press release on June 1 '15 just announced a retirement of 15planes and 21 engines.So why has the stock done so well ? Since mid-2013 when FDX was chopping around between $90 and $100, the catalyst for the sharp move higher was the share repurchase program announced in late 2013 that FDX would retire roughly 32 million shares of the common stock. At the time there was 319 million shares of FDX outstanding, while today there is 287 million.FDX management thus repurchased about 10% of FDX's market cap at the time.Part of the proceeds for the repo program were from a ""voluntary buyout"" or early retirement program initiated by FDX in late 2013. FDX stopped reporting headcount in late 2011.Given the capex nut, the share repurchase funds had to come from somewhere: here is an interesting table:FDX free-cash-flow and capital returned to s/holdersI do not know what caused the huge increase in the PRHC liability between 2011 and 2012. One explanation could be the huge Treasury rally in 2011, which is a negative influence for defined benefit plan sponsors since the future health care liability is being discounted at a much lower discount rate, hence the present value of the liability is higher. The flips side of that argument is that with rates rising in 2013 and in 2015, even though the workforce is smaller, the future liability should shrink further under pension accounting as the discount rate rises.)The point of the table was to show readers that with the deficit between free-cash-flow and capital returned to shareholders, FDX is currently bridging the gap with long-term debt issuance (at least some of it).FDX has issued $5.6 billion in debt since the May, 2011 and returned to shareholders, over $8 billion in capital.What would cause FDX stock to continue to work higher from here?1.) Continued improvement in Express, Ground and Freight volumes. It looks like Express is starting to show some life, and with FDX rationalizing the cost structure (mainly through headcount), margins should improve.2.) Continued improvement in FDX's operating margin to the 10% goal. The company hit the 10% operating margin goal briefly in mid 2007, right before the 2007 - 2008 Financial crisis hit, but that was volume driven. Continued cost improvements as well as stronger volumes are a good combination for FDX. FDX's operating margin is in the 8% area the last 3 quarters. A 10% operating margin has long been ""the promised land"" for FDX.3.) Continued moderation in jet fuel expense. Jet fuel expense has fallen from 12% to 7% the last 12 quarters for FDX, as the price of crude oil has fallen from $100 to $50. A slow recovery in crude oil prices is better than a fast recovery.4. ) A return to ""global growth"" that is widespread and in evidence across all the world's trading blocs. The free-trade bill being fast-tracked presumably could also help volumes and international trade. We were buying FDX for clients in the $90 and $100's waiting for that ""global growth"" return. Fortunately management helped shareholders out with the shareholder repurchase program.5.) The TNT acquisition, valued at 4.4 billion euro was a smart move by FDX, if they can reduce expenses. The deal terms indicate the acquisition will be paid for with cash and debt.FDX could be entering the sweet spot of the global business cycle if the world economies can generate faster growth, with moderate fuel costs and for FDX that would mean:Valuation: Trading in the $180 area, FDX is trading at 10(x) cash-flow and about 40(x) free-cash-flow. We were buyers of the stock for clients, near $90 - $100 (6(x) cash-flow) and sellers between $145 - $155 (roughly) so I'm looking at a share price that is 20% higher than the sale price.With lower fuel costs, and the share repurchase plan announced, I thought the stock price had discounted all the good news.My ""price target"" model uses a forward 4-quarter EPS estimate with a target P.E. and that is saying FDX is worth $220 per share. Morningstar's intrinsic value estimate for FDX is $171 per share, so splitting the two puts a fair value on FDX of between $190 - $200 per share. This math means that at $180, FDX is roughly 20% undervalued from a trading perspective, and maybe fairly valued from a longer-term discounted cash-flow perspective.Prior to the Q4 '15 earnings call, I may go long the stock for a trade, particularly if global interest rates continue to work higher. Japan's 10% GDP print from earlier this week was an eye-opener and just what the ""global growth"" bulls need to hear.That being said, a company like FDX that has to reinvest that amount of cash-flow via capex EVERY YEAR, can hit an air pocket in a hurry.I'd be a much more willing buyer of FDX down near $125 - $130, which is a price level that seems ridiculous, but that is the 200-week moving average level.It will be interesting to read in the earnings release or the conference call notes whether FDX can continue to return capital to the extent it has, while also paying for the TNT acquisition. (TNT represents another $4 - $4.5 billion expenditure for FDX, to be paid for in part with cash and debt.)FDX today in my opinion is a classic example of loving a company and brand, and yet hating the stock. From a relative strength perspective FDX has shown great strength as the rest of the Transport sector has lagged.FDX could be trying to pull a Home Depot (NYSE:HD), with TNT complicating the issue.Last interesting stat: FDX's debt-to-capital today is 31% up from 10% in 2010, 2011. More debt will be added with TNT's buy. According to Thomson Reuters Eikon, FDX is rated BBB by Standard & Poors which makes me wonder how levered FDX could get with senior unsecured debt, (i.e. funding buybacks and acquisitions) before the rating agencies get nervous. (Thinking out loud.)For a cash-flow geek like me, it will be interesting to see whether the share repurchase plan can be continued.Fundamentals: 10(x) cash-flow is a little rich for a company like FDX. The P.E. ratio of 18(x) is still modest given the 30% EPS growth rate in fiscal '15 and expected 20% growth rate in '16.Technicals: Stock is overbought on all the charts, but relative strength has been impressive relative to a weak Transport group.Sentiment: Bullish: a lot of hedge funds and big players have jumped on the stock in the last year. Continuing the return-of-capital could be an issue, but we'll hear what management says."
3021766,23164,2015-03-24T14:21:09-04:00,"I remain bullish on FedEx as a robust US and global economy will keep the strong momentum going for the company.Considering the EPS growth outlook for FY15 and FY16, FedEx is not trading at expensive forward valuations and the stock looks good for more upside after consolidation.I expect fuel cost to remain low in the coming quarters and this will continue to boost operating margin for FedEx.","When I last wrote about FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), I had a bullish view of the stock. For YTD 2015, the stock movement has been flat with negative returns of 1% during this period. In my view, this is a period of consolidation for FedEx and the stock is likely to move higher in the coming quarters. This article discusses some key reasons to be bullish on the stock.Reason OneOn March 2, 2015, FedEx released its economic update, and I follow this data closely as it provides insights on the growth trajectory in the coming quarters. FedEx's growth is strongly linked to global economic activity and it is therefore important to keep an eye on the company's expectations on the global economic trend.Coming to the economic update release, FedEx expects US GDP growth at 3.1% for 2015 after the economy grew at 2.8% in 2014. Further, the company expects global GDP growth to be 2.8% in 2015 after a GDP growth of 2.4% in 2014.Therefore, the economic forecast remains robust and I believe that this will help FedEx in sustaining a strong growth momentum in the coming quarters.Reason TwoFuel charge is an important cost component for FedEx, and I believe that a lower oil price is a big positive for the company through 2015. In few of my earlier articles, I have explained how high oil inventory will prevent oil prices from rising in 1H15, and my view is also that oil prices might witness a gradual increase in 2H15. This trend will translate into a higher operating margin for FedEx.To put things into perspective, fuel cost as a percentage of revenue was 10.3% for three months ended February 28, 2014. After the slump in oil prices, fuel cost has come down to 6.9% of revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2015.Clearly, lower oil prices have a strong impact on operating margin expansion and this positive trend is likely to continue through 2015.Reason ThreeFor the fiscal year ending May 2015, FedEx has reaffirmed an EPS guidance of $8.5 to $9.0 per share. If the mid-range of the guidance is considered, FedEx is likely to post an EPS of $8.75 for FY15. After clocking an EPS of $6.75 for FY14, the $8.75 EPS for FY15 would imply a robust 30% EPS growth.I must also add that an EPS of $8.75 would imply a PE of 19.7 for FY15, and I don't believe that this is expensive considering that analyst estimates suggest robust EPS growth for FedEx even for FY16.Considering analyst estimates of 22.5% EPS growth for FY16, the likely EPS for FY16 will be $10.7. This would translate into a forward (FY16) PE of 16.1 considering the current stock price of $172 per share. A PE of 16 is certainly not expensive when EPS growth rate is 22%. This would imply a forward PEG of less than 1 and backs my point that FedEx is likely to move higher from current levels.ConclusionI believe that these are the critical reasons that back my case for more upside for FedEx in FY15. In addition, investors need to note that FedEx has a capital expenditure of $4.2 billion for FY15, and the capital expenditure is primarily directed towards margin expansion activity. Once the company's old fleet is replaced with a new fleet, the fuel efficiency will take operating margin higher.FedEx had an operating margin of 7.6% for FY14, and the company is targeting an operating margin of 10% over the next few years. A new aircraft fleet is the positive trigger for achieving this goal, while oil prices surging higher over the next few years is the key risk factor. However, this risk factor is unlikely to play out over the next 3-4 quarters.Therefore, investors can consider buying FedEx at current levels as it seems the stock is in a consolidation phase. The next rally is likely to take the stock higher than its previous 52-week high of $183.5."
3055186,39351,2015-04-07T14:04:10-04:00,"Tuesday morning, FedEx announced a $4.8 billion all-cash offer to buy out TNT Express, a Dutch logistics firm.The deal will substantially build upon FedEx's European operations and will give the firm increased scale, and should help drive operational efficiencies.While TNT Express has shown financial result stagnation, an integration into FedEx's business could help initiate a turnaround.While the deal is somewhat small relative to FedEx's size, it remains a strategically important transaction and has the potential to seriously support the firm's long-term growth plans.","This morning, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced a $4.8 billion all-cash offer to buy the Dutch delivery and logistics firm TNT Express (OTCPK:TNTEY). The offer represents a 33% premium to TNT Express's Thursday closing price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and also comes with the support of TNT Express's largest shareholder PostNL N.V., which holds a 14.7% stake in the Dutch carrier. Over three years ago, UPS (NYSE:UPS) announced its intention to purchase TNT Express in a $6.8 billion deal that was ultimately blocked by the European Commission. UPS has a rather larger European business than FedEx does and FedEx stated in its conference call that it is very confident that it will achieve regulatory approval. The firm has committed to a number of terms that will it keep the combined firm's operations in the Netherlands including honoring existing employment terms and making the regional headquarters of the merged operations' business in Amsterdam/Hoofddorp. Additionally, FedEx will sell off TNT Express's airline in order to stay compliant with European regulations. The deal has been supported by a substantially stronger dollar/weaker euro that has given FedEx the opportunity to purchase a quality business at an attractive price in a somewhat overvalued market. While there are risks to this deal, as TNT Express's integration into FedEx's business gives the opportunity for substantial financial and operational efficiencies that could provide meaningful earnings accretion in the coming years.FDX data by YChartsWhile synergy specifics were not mentioned, there is meaningful opportunity to produce high levels of earnings accretion to FedEx after integrating TNT ExpressThis acquisition has the potential to provide meaningful financial and operational benefits for shareholders through greater scale and a more robust transportation network. The combined company will be able to deliver value by offering a more efficient and cost effective service to customers. The deal is a prime opportunity for FedEx with relative currency trends favoring the deal and it will be able to quickly and efficiently expand its European business through this acquisition. Given the amount of time until the transaction is expected to close as well as the scale of FedEx's business, it will continue to build its cash balances to fund this acquisition and may take on a reasonable amount of debt in order to finance it. While FedEx remains one of the world's leading shipping and logistics firms with a market cap of roughly $49 billion, this acquisition should be highly complementary to its European business and will be important for the company's growth in coming years.While TNT Express has posted lackluster financial results in recently, FedEx will be instrumental in driving a turnaroundAs TNT Express has reported net income losses for both 2013 and 2014, its shares have suffered. From the beginning of 2013 through yesterday, shares of TNT Express have fallen by 42.2% on the OTC markets. Additionally, TNT Express has suffered revenue troubles as they have fallen modestly while its business remained somewhat stagnant. In early 2014, TNT Express announced its Outlook strategy that sought to implement a number of initiatives to improve its business operations in the wake of UPS's failed acquisition attempt of the Dutch firm. This included bringing in a new management team and driving operational efficiencies and driving growth in its more profitable markets. While this was an important step for TNT Express to take, FedEx's acquisition of the firm will likely be a more effective way to create a turnaround, as the firm's existing footprint will enable it to unlock synergies in Europe and elsewhere. FedEx is a strong operator and has experience integrating acquired businesses and the TNT Express deal represents a very large opportunity. While time will tell how effective FedEx's integration of TNT Express's business is and the level of synergies that will be achieved, the acquisition seems like a strong business combination and gives FedEx the opportunity to build its European business at an attractive price."
3016586,25120,2015-03-21T09:49:37-04:00,"FedEx is benefiting from lower fuel prices, as lower fuel surcharges and dollar strength hurt sales.The trouble is when excluding the impact of fuel prices, margins are seeing some pressure.Combined with very modest earnings growth predicted for the fourth quarter, I think the operational performance is disappointing.All of this combined with the premium valuation following strong momentum seen in recent years makes me very cautious at current times.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported third quarter results which were not really convincing. Lower fuel surcharges and a strong dollar hurt sales growth as the margin developments excluding fuel costs have not been that great.Given the softer outlook for fourth quarter earnings, it is easy to see why investors are disappointed. One should also take into account that shares have nearly doubled over the past two years. This has raised the expectations as the execution appears to have been soft in the past quarter.Third Quarter PerformanceThe overall FedEx company saw its revenues grow by 3.7% to $11.72 billion. Growth has been driven by continued e-commerce growth in the lucrative ground segment.Total costs were up by 0.9% to $10.75 billion, providing a big boost to operating margins. Operating margins came in at 8.2% of sales which marked a 250 basis points improvement versus the year before.The main driver behind this margin expansion has been a 30.4% decline in the fuel bill, which came in at $810 million for the quarter. This means that fuel costs were equivalent to 6.9% of sales which is 340 basis points less compared to the year before. This implies that if fuel prices would have been constant, margins would have fallen by nearly a percent. This follows higher maintenance and repair costs, as well as salary and compensation expenses.Of course, it is too simplistic to say that FedEx has not done a good job on the cost side. The margin expansion has been driven by lower fuel prices, which has resulted in stronger earnings. To combat high fuel prices in the past, FedEx had instituted fuel surcharges which are coming down now. This factor and the higher incentive compensation awarded to its staff hurt margins and have not been quantified.With these items, FedEx has created flexibility in its business model through fuel surcharges and variable compensation expenses. This model allows FedEx to cancel out the swings in the fuel prices to some degree, resulting in more stable margins throughout oil and business cycles.Following the lower fuel costs and sales growth, net earnings did see a big jump. Net earnings rose by 53% to $580 million which is equivalent to $2.01 per share. On the conference call, CFO Alan Graf explained that share repurchases aided earnings per share by eleven cents for the quarter.Looking Through The SegmentsThe slower growth was driven by a weaker performance at the largest express segment. Revenues at the largest segment fell by 0.3% to $6.66 billion following lower fuel surcharges and adverse currency movements. These negative factors more than offset the increase in prices and volumes. Profit margins at Express increased by 330 basis points to 5.8% of sales, following improved productivity, lower fuel costs and volume growth.The Ground segment continues to thrive following the continued growth of e-commerce. Sales grew by 12% to $3.39 billion as already fat operating margins improved by another 20 basis points to 16.4% of sales. Improved volumes, rates and better weather have been aiding the results. The recent acquisition of Genco added $87 million in quarterly sales.Premium ValuationFedEx ended the year with a liquid balance sheet containing nearly $3.5 billion in cash. Total debt outstanding stood at $7.2 billion, for a net debt load of $3.7 billion. Traditionally, FedEx has operated with a much smaller debt load, as leverage has been increasing in recent times following share repurchases.These share repurchases have reduced the outstanding share float to 287 million shares. At $175 per share, this values equity in the business at little over $50 billion. Including the net debt holdings, the business is valued at $54 billion.For the year, FedEx sees earnings of $8.80 to $8.95 per share, which implies that fourth quarter earnings are seen at $2.55 to $2.70 per share. Revenues for the year are seen around $47.5 billion, with the earnings guidance suggesting earnings of $2.5 to $2.6 billion. This implies that the business is valued at 1.1 times sales with equity trading at 19-20 times earnings.This valuation seems reasonably attractive versus competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS). While UPS is a bit bigger compared to FedEx, it has grown less quickly in recent years. UPS has slightly higher operating margins on a trailing basis thanks to its larger scale, although the differences are not that large.UPS commands a roughly $100 billion enterprise valuation on the stock market, resulting in a 1.7 times sales multiple. Given the largely similar margins of both firms, the earnings multiple at UPS is steeper as well at 30 times earnings. While FedEx might look attractively priced compared to UPS, I do not think that it is necessarily cheap as UPS looks expensive to me.One other global player in the field is DHL, the express and logistics unit of Deutsche Post (OTCPK:DPSTF). This German-based player has a valuation of $41 billion which translates into a sales ratio of just 0.6 times given that revenues came in at $74 billion on a trailing basis. This lower sales multiple results from the legacy mail activities which are included in this business as well, and carry much lower margins.Operating margins reported by Deutsche Post come in at just 5%, thereby trailing those of its U.S. counterparts. Despite the lower margin profile, the earnings multiple looks relatively attractive at just 15 times earnings.Somewhat Slower GrowthThe 3.7% revenue growth rate reported for the third quarter marked a slowdown from the 4.8% growth rate reported for the first three quarters of the year. This means that growth has seen a slowdown, which can easily be explained by the impact of a stronger dollar and lower fuel surcharges.Despite the slower growth, FedEx continues to invest heavily for future growth. The company anticipates to invest $4.2 billion in terms of capital expenditures this year. These investments exceed depreciation charges of an estimated $2.6 billion by a large degree. As a result, FedEx is net investing some $1.6 billion into the company, a very substantial amount given that earnings come in around $2.6 billion per year.The $200-$250 million annual dividend is very modest, although FedEx has been increasing its debt in order to finance share repurchases. Over the past three quarters alone, FedEx has been buying back roughly $4 billion of its shares. The company has been able to secure long term and cheap financing to be able to execute on these share repurchases.Final Thoughts, Priced For GrowthThe guidance for fourth quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.70 per share seems very strong, but it should be noted that the fiscal fourth quarter is typically the strongest of the year. In the final quarter of last year, FedEx posted earnings of $2.48 per share. This means that earnings per share are seen up by 3 to 9%.That is not very impressive given that the share count in the third quarter has been down by 7% compared to last year, which implies that actual dollar earnings might come in flat. FedEx stresses that much of this lack of real earnings growth can be tied to higher incentive compensation expenses.This guidance is disappointing especially as investors have hoped for a bigger boost to the bottom line from lower fuel prices. In reality, FedEx appears to be passing through quite some benefits through lower surcharges to its customers. On top of that, FedEx is seeing slower growth following a stronger dollar as the cost performance excluding fuel has been quite mixed at best.As a result, FedEx remains a very slow growing business with growth coming in at 4% per year by now. Despite the slow growth and historical high margins, shares have been awarded a rich 20 times earnings multiple. While fuel costs provide a short-term boom, many benefits are passed on to customers as well as employees.As a result, FedEx is just an average company, although it has good prospects following the continued growth in e-commerce. Following reasonably solid operating conditions, FedEx is now posting operating margins of 8%, which is historically high. Given the already solid margins, and the fact that shares have doubled from levels of $90 in April of 2013, the expectations have been high.This has not been a great quarter in my eyes as the overall growth is not that impressive. For now, shares trade at a 10-20% premium compared to the overall market following the strong run-up in the shares in recent years. This has pushed up the expectations as I see few incremental drivers on top of long-term trends such as e-commerce growth. At the same time, the impact of lower fuel prices has already been priced in. For these reasons, shares remain a no-go area at current levels in my eyes.At market-equivalent, or slightly lower multiples, I am willing to peg a 16 times earnings multiple to the shares. This suggests a potential entry point at $140-$150 per share, levels which are still 15-20% below the current price levels.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3056926,70965,2015-04-08T11:09:54-04:00,"We don't own FDX yet, but we will. Our last article on FDX commented about how bullish we were on earnings.Tuesday's news of the TNT Express acquisition is brilliant and adds to our thoughts that FedEx could be a lifetime hold.If FDX traded at the same multiple as UPS, it would be around $195.","By Parke ShallIt has been just days since we released our outlook on FedEx (NYSE:FDX), heading into the company's last earnings report. We were bullish on FDX due to the industry it's in, the dividend it pays, and the coming growth opportunities it's going to have as United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) continues to struggle and FDX continues to expand its global footprint. As you can see in the below chart, shares dipped slightly after its earnings report and since then have pushed back above $170. For the last five years, FDX has doubled or more, depending on when you purchased it. If you've been compounding dividends while owning it, it's probably been a fantastic ride up.FDX data by YChartsFDX has been a beauty for those who have been long. Generally, at stages like this, people look at charts like the above one with skeptical eyes, as if a stock up this much can't continue to move higher. For instance, if you took money off the table when it based at $130, you would have missed the move even higher. In this case, we think FDX has the goods to keep trending higher for the long term, even in a bearish market or a rate hike situation.Our timing on suggesting the company due to its growing overseas footprint couldn't have been better. We assure you, we're not as psychic as it may look from the timing of Tuesday's news.Tuesday's news was that FDX made a bid for overseas competitor TNT Express (OTC:TNTEF). It's been a talking point for those invested in FedEx for a while. As the company stretches the types of shipping offerings to expand its business and grow revenue, it eventually will also need to increase its global locations. The biggest opportunity for the company is overseas. Like many other merger ideas, this one made too much sense to not go through. We feel the same way about the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS)/Dish (NASDAQ:DISH) merger, which is a different story altogether, but one we took the time to write up and that you can read about here.We're going to join the list of analysts that speak highly of this move for FDX. According to Seeking Alpha, this will provide FDX/TNT with a market share of ""17% in Europe, vs. 19% for DHL and 16% for UPS"". It's not complete and total domination, but it's a darn good start.The list of countries the company still has yet to move into gets smaller and smaller, and most of the reasons for avoiding these areas have nothing to do with their economies and more to do with geography and imminent danger of certain death.Despite this, there are also areas where FedEx is underdeveloped as a business, and Europe is one of those areas.As we said in our last article, there are very few equities that we would look to buy almost regardless of price (within reason). There are some companies that we feel are just going to have continued growth over such a long-term cycle that it's almost meaningless to pick your entry points now if you're thinking of a 15- to 30-year time horizon. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS), and names like American Express (NYSE:AXP) and BP (NYSE:BP) are part of this group. We're strong believers that FedEx fits this group.With the continued trouble that the UPS keeps having, privatized delivery services will eventually be on their way to taking over. While we don't think UPS is a bad investment, either, we prefer FedEx for the same reason we prefer American Express out of the credit card companies. We think the brand has a prestige to it that will continue to serve it well. Out of the private delivery services, FedEx is the one that we believe consumers trust the most, and the ones that provide superlative delivery services and customer services that make them above and beyond others in the industry.The operational expenses of expanding the business have caused the company's revenue to skyrocket, while its bottom line only inches upward. The synergies from the coming acquisition should help the company's margin significantly, once the inevitable transitional period is over.FDX Net Income (Quarterly) data by YChartsNo, that is not an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) chart.FDX is still priced attractively at just 15.8 times what it's expected to earn next year. Synergies from this acquisition and the resulting international business will eventually, post-transition, improve margins and allow the noose around profit to loosen a bit. The company trades at a modest 1x sales and at about 3x book value.Competitor UPS trades at a forward multiple of 18x.Considering its growth prospects have never been more promising, we find that the multiple here has plenty of room to expand. For example, the S&P average of 18 times earnings would put FDX at about $195/share. We see no reason to discount the multiple here as we think the company's business and cash flow both remain very real."
3010576,74305,2015-03-18T11:36:16-04:00,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) reported its 3Q15 financial results with EPS $2.01, up from $1.23 a year earlier.Revenue totaled $11.7bn, slightly lagging behind the estimate by 0.85%.The impact of $1.7bn profitability improvement plan is still unclear.","EventFedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) reported its 3Q15 financial results with net profit of $580million, or EPS $2.01, up from $1.23 a year earlier and comfortably ahead of the $1.87 forecast by 7.5%. Revenue grew 4% to reach $11.7bn but still slightly missed the estimate by 0.85%. According to the conference call, the main drivers of profit were the net benefit from fuel and the profit improvement program initiatives. Given the impact of its two-fold margin improvement strategy--growing share in the higher margin Ground business and reducing cost in Express segment--is still unclear, I would keep my current position before further improvement material is available from the company.Key Factors UpdateGround segment remains the key driver. The revenue of Ground segment totaled $3.39bn, up 12% from the same period a year earlier. Unlike Express business, Ground segment is operating with a much lower capital intensity, which allows it to continue to take share but not at the expense of price. With a better positioned Ground business model, the company takes the upper hand in the B2C model. By using independent contractor model to lower incremental cost, FDX has first moving advantage as the inferior density characteristics of B2C leave new competitors less room to grow. It is the reason why FDX was able to become a major player with 25% market share after 1998. Also, to strengthen its current position in domestic market, the company starts its $50 million Hamburg project, a 320,000-square-foot complex for FDX Ground Transport, which speaks the change of capital spending priorities. It is the investment that goes in line with its profitability improvement plan, in my view.Express asset returns show minimal improvement. Express segment reported a revenue of $6.66bn, slightly lower than the $6.67bn a year earlier. Although the operating margin increased 2.5% to reach 5.8%, the asset returns still below 10% targeted by the management team. Unlike the Ground business, which can be operated through a hub network in less expensive locations, the time-definite Express segment must close to airport and densely populated places as it needs airplanes and facilities to deliver the time sensitive packages. As a consequence, the delivery cost is much higher as it gives less flexibility in terms of driver routing schedules. Plus, the investment in Express air network is not an appropriate decision in an oversupplied market and, hence, offsets the margin improvement, in my view.Freight Segment keeps robust. This quarter, the company reported $1.43bn in revenue, up 6% from the same period a year earlier. LTL (Less-than-truckload) average daily shipment revenue increased 3% due to higher weight per shipment and higher rates. Given the lack of material improvement to date, I would keep my prior analysis and expect a stable growth in this segment.Key risks to my thesis are 1) the seasonal nature of B2C business in Ground segment, 2) the lag impact of fuel surcharge in its expenses, and most importantly, 3) the uncertainty of its $1.7bn profit improvement plan. Although FDX delivered a strong growth in Q3, I would argue the profitability may not be sustainable after stripping out the impact of fuel and reduced pension expense. In conclusion, I would like to see the clear margin improvement from Express before taking any further action."
3055596,20411,2015-04-07T16:24:05-04:00,"FDX was under pressure.But buy signals surfaced recently.On the heels of news, Wall Street is taking notice again.","Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are up solidly today on the heels of an announcement that the company intends to acquire TNT Express. Most often when a company announces an acquisition of another company and that acquisition is not immediately accretive to earnings, this one is not, the company who is making that acquisition rarely increases in price. When they do, like FedEx is today, investors should take notice.Rational minds suggest that when a company increases when it makes an acquisition either the company it is acquiring fits so well in the portfolio that it is expected to add significant value going forward, or eyeballs have simply opened and are starting to pay more attention to the value of the company making the acquisition. Our observations of FedEx suggest the latter to be true.In fact, FedEx has come on our radar in recent days. In our daily newsletter, Stock Traders Daily has identified FedEx a number of times recently as the stock flirted with buy signals.Our combined analysis for FedEx goes beyond the buy signals that seemed to be triggering over the past few days and looks at valuation metrics, and it seems to be that which analysts are actually paying attention to again on the heels of this announcement.Valuation based on analysts' forward looking estimates for FedEx, not including this acquisition, makes FedEx look attractive on a fundamental basis but in recent weeks Wall Street has been ignoring those valuations; that seems to have changed on the heels of this acquisition announcement.Specifically, our analysis suggests that earnings growth at FedEx is expected to be over 23% this year, over 26% next year, and as of the last earnings report, earnings growth was over 17%.When we compare earnings growth to the PE multiple we get our peg ratio fair value analysis in a much clearer picture. Our definition of fair value is when a stock trades with a peg ratio between 0 and 1.5, but FedEx was trading with a peg ratio much closer to 2 until the beginning of 2015.Reasonably, that suggests the valuation for FedEx was not as attractive then as it is now. So what changed? The answer is earnings expectations and price. Based on the results that have already been provided the peg ratio for FedEx is now 1.24, within our desired range, and that is represented by the blue dot in our peg ratio chart. The first red dot is what the peg ratio will be at the end of 2015 if analysts are correct about their estimates and price remains the same, and that is 0.81, while the second red dot represents 2016 and is 0.60, respectively. That means the valuation ratios will look better and better going into 2016 if analysts are correct.In summary, our fair value analysis for FedEx suggests that the stock is likely to increase on a fundamental basis given what we know at this time. This data can change, but so far we have green lights not only based on a fundamental but also on a technical evaluation of the stock itself. Arguably, the technical indicators triggered earlier, but so did the fundamental observations and it is reasonable therefore to assume that today's acquisition has largely opened the eyes of the investment public to the relative value in shares of FedEx again."

However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.FDX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - February 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFDX Dividend data by YChartsConclusionFedEx Corporation performs well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the level of debt relative to the net current assets. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.50 in 2011 to an estimated $6.87 for 2015. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate of 8.16% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still estimates a growth figure much higher than the market's implied rate. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time."

Revenue estimates of $11.87B are slightly higher than the Street's consensus of $11.82B.Despite what should be a great environment for the transport names, lower gas prices paired with heightened consumer confidence and the increasing popularity of e-commerce shopping, FedEx and some of its peers missed their Q4 expectations. Earnings per share for the latest quarter came in at $2.14, lower than the Estimize consensus of $2.17 and much lower than the $2.22 which the Street was anticipating. Revenue per package fell due to decreased fuel surcharges and lower weight, and international revenue per package was flat due to unfavorable currency trends.It's important to note, however, that FedEx's Q4 numbers ended with November results, therefore only capturing the very beginning of the holiday shopping season. Sales during black Friday weekend and cyber Monday were admittedly disappointing, with holiday shopping not heating up until the end of December and even carrying into the beginning of January. With holiday sales for the 2014 season hitting a 3-year high, and new records for e-commerce sales, Q1 revenues should be enough to offset any currency headwinds if the company managed properly.Another win for the transport stocks will be the recently introduced ""dimensional weight pricing,"" which previously only applied to packages greater than 3 feet. This is essentially the same as increasing prices, and there is no downside for logistics companies. If shippers decide to right-size their packaging, FedEx will be able to take more packages per trip. If shippers do not adapt and continue to use boxes that are too large, they will just have to pay up for it. Either way, FedEx wins. The rumor is that this could boost shipping costs by 5-25%.FedEx's target price was recently upgraded by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, which certainly helped the stock which is up 2% for the year.Disclosure: None"

Nearest catalyst could be early October although we expect positive ticks in the next three months.Nominal valuation lower than the UPS offer 2 years ago, but more valuable in real terms, considering the current state of TNT Express.There are no competition concerns, but the timetable will be lengthy due to the EU and Chinese reviews. Completion expected by early 2016.Shareholders united under the leadership of an activist could realistically push for a small price increase, but don’t count on this.","Still AttractiveTNT Express NV (OTC:TNTEF) (OTCPK:TNTEY) (AMS:TNTE) is one of those infamous names that trigger fear, distrust and hesitation among European merger arbitrage professionals, alongside BSkyB, BAE (OTCPK:BAESY) and a few other protagonists of huge adverse volatility in the last five years.TNTE, after negotiating a potential merger with United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in 2012 and following a protracted antitrust review by the EU Competition Commission in 2013, was finally left behind when UPS decided to cancel negotiations with the EU authorities and terminate the unsuccessful takeover of TNTE. The share price of TNTE dropped 36% in two weeks, critical two weeks, as they fell right before New Year's Eve in 2012.At the time, it was expected that UPS would be able to complete the transaction only if FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) agreed to buy the divested assets that would necessarily be offloaded if the EU antitrust regulator were to approve a TNTE-UPS concentration. This never happened.FDX chose to stay on the sidelines, not obstructing but not aiding either. The proposed acquisition of TNTE by UPS collapsed (the official line is that UPS believed that the EU Commission's demands were too restrictive, undermining the rationale of the transaction). The rest is history in the making.TNTE, battling in a highly competitive European market, is still attractive to a global aggregator with little antitrust concerns, an aggregator that would not need external cooperation to complete a takeover, but rather internal agreement with management, shareholders, unions, regulators and possibly the Dutch government. FDX has reached a conditional agreement to acquire TNTE, offering shareholders €8 per share.Valuation Of TNT Express Is FairTNTE is basically a logistics company focused on the delivery of time-sensitive and non-rushed parcels, documents and palletized freight all over the world, with a competitive advantage in Europe due to its valuable road and air network, serving efficient hubs and depots in the continent.When tallied to its peers on an undisturbed basis (prior to the offer announcement), TNTE trades at a discount to comparable companies, as seen in table 1 below:Table 1 - TNT Express's and Comparable Companies' Trading MetricsThe overall discount could be explained by the turnaround veil on TNTE (recently divested operations and restructured reporting and decision making) and the uncertain demand environment in Europe from where TNTE obtains more than two-thirds of its annual revenue. We actually believe that the European deliveries market and SMEs performance could be close to an inflection point in the next 24 months, for which we now assign a higher valuation to TNTE than in 2012, when we valued the standalone entity at 6.6x EV/EBITDA.We have estimated that TNTE could now be valued at between €5.40 and €5.90 per share on a standalone basis, which would indicate a fair takeover price between €6.45 and €7.50 per share. For this calculation, we have estimated run-rate synergies at half the rate anticipated for the merger of TNTE and UPS in 2012 and separately applied a 6% cost-cutting program over costs of materials, work contracted out and other operating expenses. The cost-cutting program applied deliberately skims larger synergies due to (i) the lack of significant operational overlap in the express business, and (ii) the express commitment that FDX indicated in its both conference calls on 7th April, 2015, to keep TNTE's management and labor force unchanged (as much as possible).Based on the above, we believe that the offer fairly values TNTE and its (uncertain) prospects as a standalone entity.PostNL Had No Other Choice But To Support The OfferTNTE's shareholding registry is now less concentrated than in 2012 when UPS ventured to make an offer for TNTE. The offer then was several times rejected by the TNTE management at prices above the €8 per share that it recommends now to take from FDX. This is quite telling, as nobody would know more than the board of directors about the true value of the company.We would think that shareholders would know. PostNL (AMS:PNL) (OTCPK:PNLYY), TNTE's largest shareholder, with 14.7% of the share capital, has been mentioned as giving irrevocable undertakings to FDX in support of this offer, however, we take this with a pinch of salt. PNL had no other choice.As per the Relationship Agreement signed between PNL and TNTE after the demerger (updated in February 2013), if a public offer is made for TNTE, PNL is obliged to tender its shares to such an offer insofar as the offer has been backed by the executive and supervisory boards of TNTE and recommended to shareholders.The devil is in the detail. Even though the announcement could be seen as being approved by TNTE's management and its largest shareholder, which under normal circumstances would carry valuable information to minority shareholders, the case is more akin to an executive agreement between management boards, in which it is very unlikely that PNL had any relevant input, particularly regarding pricing of the offer.Nonetheless, as indicated in the previous section, we do not object the pricing of this offer and believe that other shareholders would neither do so.We have no information about the standing of Artisan Partners, Tweedy, Browne Co., Mackenzie Financial and Franklin Advisers, which account to more than 18% of TNTE's share capital (about one third of the share capital together with PNL).It must be noted that PNL could terminate the irrevocable undertaking in the event that the executive and supervisory boards of TNTE revoke their recommendation of the offer upon a bona fide third party making an offer which exceeds the offer price by at least 8%, that is not matched by FDX.Pricing Pressure Very UnlikelyAt the time of writing, we do not see any pricing pressure and expect no updating of the price, for the following reasons:We cannot completely rule out a wild card scenario in which shareholders, unassisted by TNTE's management, would claim for a better price. Again, we would see this as an empty threat since there is no alternative bidder and the company does not expect a technological breakthrough that would require a sudden reassessment of the offer price.On the other hand, a not-so-wild-card scenario could be the involvement of private equity investors, given the prospects of a growing cash flow stream from European operations. But again, we believe that no matter how minimal possible synergies between TNTE and FDX could be, this normally represents a considerable advantage over financial sponsors coming with financial firepower and no operational overlaps. We believe that in a private equity/industry battle for TNTE, FDX would have the upper hand due to its ability to hit the ground running and its low cost of finance.These are elements that we believe will be considered by current TNTE shareholders, alongside the capital needs that have accumulated in TNTE due to the lack of investment in productivity and service capabilities when assessing the choice of tendering their shares or remaining invested in the company. We believe that shareholders will favor tendering their shares since there are other players in the express market that could provide with some exposure to the sector.Antitrust Not An ObstacleWe could not be more categorical in stating that this transaction will not be derailed by competition concerns in Europe. The transaction could be delayed due to lengthy reviews, especially in China by MOFCOM, but we believe that the timetable will be completed.Although TNTE's market share in the domestic and intra-European express market has decreased in the last few years, due to intense competition, we estimate that its presence in the B2B segment with same-day, time-sensitive parcels and time-uncertain large deliveries could represent about 15% of the market, making it one of the largest players in the delivery system.FDX, on the other hand, has no significant presence in Europe, having concentrated its efforts in North America and Asia. The principal players in Europe are TNTE, DPW operating as DHL, La Poste, Royal Mail and DPD, depending on the point of actuation (first mile, domestic/international border, last mile, etc).As far as we know, pre-filing negotiations have not been started, but we do not put much value on this since the transaction itself is unlikely to trigger remedies or insurmountable negotiations.We do expect a Phase II review from the EU Competition Commission due to the particular definitions of markets and products and the requirement to run referral consultations with the Member States in compliance with Article 4 of the EC Merger Regulation 139/2004.Although we believe that the current transaction represents a concentration with a community dimension, within the meaning of Article 1 of the EC Merger Regulation 139/2004, we do not expect regulatory obstacles beyond the characteristic lengthy procedure. We estimate that the transaction could be approved in Europe by the end of 2015 depending on the specific timing of the filings. We provide details on the timetable in the next section.Long TimetableBased on the AFM and the EC Merger Regulations, we have estimated a timetable for completion of this transaction. We highlight that this timetable is preliminary and subject to specific timings for filings and decisions, however, minimum and maximum statutory lapses have been considered to estimate the timetable.The offer announcement vaguely states that the companies expect the transaction to complete during the first half of 2016. We estimate that the offer could be declared unconditional by the end of October 2015, with nothing but competition clearances pending.Clearance from the EU, after initiating proceedings in September 2015 could arrive by mid-January 2016, with Chinese clearance arriving sometime later in Q1 2016. Although Brazilian CADE is required to approve the transaction, we do not see a problem here and reiterate that the EU and Chinese regulatory approvals will drive the timetable into 2016.Table 2 - Estimated Timetable for CompletionClosing RemarksThis is the point that separates the investors from the readers, particularly after what happened to TNTE in 2013 when the proposed acquisition by UPS fell through. From an antitrust point of view, this transaction is more certain than the UPS one, so here we should find some comfort, especially those of us who were in the market with TNTE/UPS in 2012-2013.Although the current FDX offer at €8 per share is nominally lower than the €9.50 that UPS offered for TNTE in 2012, the valuation is higher, the risk is perceived as lower and the prospects for an independent TNTE do not compare to those of years past, particularly now that the company is in the middle of a restructuring plan that is yet to bear fruit.The proposed transaction is still subject to customary conditions, but this is, as mentioned before, customary. However, we must bear in mind that the current stage is that of a conditional agreement between TNTE and FDX, one step previous to the launching of a formal offer, which in The Netherlands could take up to 12 weeks after the announcement of the conditional agreement.With this in mind, the spread is now at 4.4% (cum-dividend), providing an annualized expected return of similar magnitude since we expect closure in about 12 months' time. In our view, this does not look bad for a satisfactory risk-reward profile.There is the shadow of a wild card in the form of an offer price increase if shareholders amalgamate around a cohesive voice that manage to convince FDX obtaining 65% of the voting rights in TNTE (to arrive at the minimum approval condition of 80% with support of PNL). We do not rule out this outcome, however, we do not believe that such a scenario could be real before the first week of October 2015 when the board of directors is expected to issue/reaffirm a recommendation to the offer. We will be especially intent around this date (5-10 October 2015) as this could be a catalyst for value in the current transaction. We also keep an eye on the moves of the TNT Express Foundation (Stichting Continuïteit TNT Express), as a statement from this body will surely have an effect on price.If this scenario materializes, the return could only be enhanced to the benefit of investors. We would place a 10% probability on such a scenario, 10% probability of deal collapsing and 80% probability of completion at the current or slightly higher price.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The quarter prior, when the fuel surcharge was still in effect, Express volumes rose 4%. My question remains, did FDX benefit temporarily from the US West Coast port shutdown, which could have driven short-term demand for air freight, which was a segment FDX was seeing intense competition from commercial airlines ? With the strike over and the Port of LA returning to normal, will we see Express return to lower volume, or has there been a permanent refresh at Express and can volume's continue to grow at mid-single-digits ?FedEx Ground: Accounting for 26% of FDX's total revenues and half of its operating margin / income, you can see from just that statement the operating leverage in FDX's Ground model. The star of the show and the driver of growth for FDX since the early 2000's, Ground has seen mid-single-digit volume growth and an operating margin that has varied from 3.7% to 5% over the last three years.FDX Freight: with Freight revenues about 13% of FDX's total revenue and an operating margin between 50 bp's and 1.5%, Freight isn't a big part of FDX's business, but at least Freight isn't a drag on operating results as it was from 2010 to 2012. Freight is now contributing positively to FDX, but it is a smaller part of the total.Operating margin: according to Street research, a 100 bp (1%) increase in FDX's operating margin can lead to an increase of $0.80 in earnings per share. That is healthy operating leverage, and with the drop in crude oil, FDX is slowly moving towards their supposedly ultimate goal of a 10% operating margin. Here is a history of FDX's operating margin by quarter:FDX's operating margin by quarterSource: internal spreadsheetSo what is the point ?My worry at this point in time, with the announcement of the share repurchase program in late 2013, which was commitment to repo about 10% of common equity outstanding, there is a lot of good news baked into FDX's share price.1.) Crude oil has now fallen from $100 last summer to $44 this morning (in terms of WTI, Brent is trading near $54), and with fuel costs between 9% - 12% of FDX's revenue that is a nice bump to FDX's bottom line.2.) FDX's share repurchase program has reduced shares from 215 - 320 million outstanding to 287 million as of the November '14 quarter or 33 million shares. This again is another healthy boost to earnings per share. FDX has added long-term debt to finance some of the buyback / capex when you look at the balance sheet and statement of cash-flows.Again the point being that with the sharp drop in fuel costs thanks to crude oil and the sharp increase to EPS thanks to the buyback, some of it debt-aided, how long can both continue?Trend in EPS and revenue estimates:The Trend in ""consensus"" EPS and revenue estimates are mildly positive.Valuation: If readers simply look at the y/y EPS growth for this quarter to be reported Wednesday morning, 52% EPS growth on 5% revenue growth, is pretty extraordinary, and you have to wonder how long that can continue.For the next three years, the three year ""average"" EPS and revenue consensus is looking for 23% and 5% growth respectively, with FDX's stock currently trading at 19(x) the expected 2015 EPS consensus of $8.99 per share.On a cash-flow and free-cash-flow valuation, FDX is trading at 10(x) and 45(x) 4-quarter trailing, not nearly as cheap as the stock was 2 years ago.The key with FDX's lumpy and volatile free-cash-flow is that FDX is basically funding or looks to be funding the share repurchase program with long-term debt, which has risen from $1.25 bl as of May '12 to $4.75 billion as of Nov '14. This has raised FDX's debt to capital from 9% - 10% to 24% - 25% in the last 3 years.How much can FDX lever the balance sheet to repurchase stock and fund capex? I don't know, how high is high? Is a 40% debt-to-cap ratio too high? Watch the FDX credit rating: the rating agencies will start to squawk if they think debt issuance and financial leverage is getting too great. If FDX leverages to 33% debt-to-capital, they could still use debt to repurchase more stock, thus supporting EPS.Trinity's intrinsic value estimate on FDX has risen to $200 per share (which surprises even me) given the growth in EPS and the forward EPS estimate. Morningstar's intrinsic value estimate, which I think is a longer-term view of the stock than my own fair value estimate, is $158 per share. Averaging the two FDX is fairly valued right here from an ""intrinsic value perspective"".Conclusion/summary: I do think FDX could make another move higher if crude oil declines another 10% - 20% and FDX decides to do another ASR (accelerated share repurchase) funded by longer term debt issuance. However, I think there is A LOT of good news currently baked into the share price, with a number of tail winds in to the stock price. FDX is a business with a high degree of operating leverage: if crude oil and jet fuel costs simply stabilize, if interest rates should change (both of which, absolutely no one is looking for), and if the ""bleeding"" in the Express trade-down (from higher cost to more commodity jumbo jet freight) continues, I think the risk in the stock is to the low $150's or $140's if the tail winds become head winds.This is not a trading call on FDX. Stan Druckenmiller admonished IBM for their ""financial engineering"" gymnastics, but FDX is doing a little of it too. However FDX has brought down their fixed-cost structure with the voluntary buyout program, and you can see it in the pension and PRHC liabilities on the balance sheet.The cost-cutting, the crude oil drop and the share repurchases have all driven a marvelous return for shareholders, which our clients participated in, but at some point the tail winds become less robust or even head winds, and the operating leverage becomes a negative for shareholders.Here are some of my earlier articles on FDX, from Dec '14, where the stock was trading a little bit higher than it is today, and Sept '14 earnings preview where the stock was trading near $160."

The company has been under the microscope since January of this year when United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) warned about its guidance for the full year. At the time FedEx had reiterated their guidance and said it expected ""moderate economic growth and a small net benefit from lower fuel costs.""The stock has been in a trading range since the end of 2014 Q3 but prior to that has had a fantastic run, basically tracking the S&P out of the 2008 financial crisis. In the last year alone, the company has been up 27.4%.FDX data by YChartsA focus on the company's last report was on its operating margin, which was a result of express and freight businesses picking up. Analysts will be looking to see if operating margin can continue to expand, especially as fuel prices have continued to fall over the course of the previous quarter.Analyst estimates are calling for $1.87 this quarter on revenue of $11.79 billion. This compares to a year ago, where the company posted EPS of $1.23 on revenue of $11.30 billion. For full year 2015, the company is expected by analysts to earn $8.97, and for FY2016 the company is expected to earn $10.98.Analysts have weighed in, generally with a neutral take on FedEx's outlook from this point forward:FedEx has long been a favorite of ours and unlike some of the analysts above, we hold a bullish view heading into earnings. Our bullishness is a product of our investment horizon on FDX, which is an outlook of 15-years plus.Technically, a run up through $183 after earnings, as discussed here by Guy Adami would signal a breakout on several of FedEx's charts, including its 6-month chart. Shorter-term traders should be looking for whether or not FDX is going to break out of its trading range coming out of earnings. We would consider dips a buying opportunity and we may add on such an opportunity.While the company pays a nominal dividend that they do increase consistently, relative to its stock price the yield hasn't been too impressive. On the other hand, you are at least getting paid to hold your position in the company over time, which is the range in which we view our outlook for FedEx. We simply see the dividend as a bonus when compared to what the company is capable of doing growth-wise over the next 5-10 years.FDX Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YChartsThere are very few equities that we would look to buy almost regardless of price (within reason). There are some companies that we feel are just going to have continued growth over such a long-term cycle that it's almost meaningless to pick your entry points now if you're thinking of a 15-30 year time horizon. Apple and Disney, and names like American Express and BP are part of this group. We're strong believers that FedEx fits this group.With the continued trouble that the UPS keeps having, privatized delivery services will eventually be on their way to taking over. While we don't think UPS is a bad investment, either, we prefer FedEx for the same reason we prefer American Express out of the credit card companies. We think the brand has a prestige to it that will continue to serve it well. Out of the private delivery services, FedEx is the one that we believe consumers trust the most, and the ones that provide superlative delivery service and customer services that make them above and beyond others in the industry.Going forward, the company now only trades at 15.7x its forward estimates and has a modest 1.0x price to sales and 3.1x price to book ratio. With a secure balance sheet, plenty of cash on hand to keep operating with, and $4.8 billion in operating cash flow from the trailing-twelve-month period, FedEx stands to be in good shape moving forward. While there are many other companies that we would not consider at this multiple in today's market, we think FedEx can continue its growth, even in the midst of a market pullback (which could discount the equity price) and an economy where discretionary spending could slow.We're bullish on FedEx into earnings."
2852606,23164,2015-01-28T04:43:50-05:00,UPS has reported that it anticipates lower than expected results for 4Q14 and the stock slumped on the news.I expect 2015 to remain challenging for UPS and management has indicated continued margin compression for the year.Operating margin for FedEx has been expanding and will continue to expand in 2015 on the back of a modern fleet.,"In the air delivery and freight services industry, United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are the market leaders and both stocks have been big value creators in the past.However, UPS recently slumped from $114.25 to $102.93 in one trading session as the company provided a gloomy outlook for the fourth quarter and for FY14. This article discusses the reasons to remain bearish on UPS and bullish on FedEx for 2015.On January 23, 2015, UPS announced that it anticipates 4Q14 adjusted EPS of approximately $1.25. Full-year 2014 adjusted EPS is expected to be $4.75, up 3.9% over 2013 adjusted EPS of $4.57. Further, on a GAAP basis, the diluted earnings are expected to be approximately $3.28 per share, compared to $4.61 in 2013.Therefore, the company disappointed on its own guidance and the lower earnings is attributed to underperformance of the US domestic sector. While the company's volumes and revenue were in-line with expectations, the margins were compressed due to peak season operating cost.According to David Abney, UPS chief executive officer -I wanted to mention this point as investors would suggest that the depressed sentiments are one-offs and UPS would be well positioned with a better pricing strategy in 2015.However, investors need to note another remark that comes from the management -These comments translate into the following conclusion -The second point is important as I wanted to discuss that FedEx looks relatively attractive for 2015.In comparison to a relatively gloomy EPS outlook for 2015 for UPS, FedEx reaffirmed on January 23, 2015 that its earnings forecast for 2015 remains at $8.5 to $9.0 per share. For the second quarter of 2015, the company had clocked a robust EPS growth of 36% to $2.14 per diluted share as compared to $1.57 per diluted share in the prior year period.Further, I also want to highlight the point that for the first nine months of 2014, UPS reported an operating margin of 10% as compared to an operating margin of 12.7% for the first nine months of 2013.Therefore, the company's trend is margin compression and 4Q14 results will further compress margins. In addition, the company has stated that 2015 will be challenging and I believe that margin compression will continue.On the other hand, FedEx has been gradually improving its margin and the company's margin expansion is likely to continue. From an operating margin of 7.6% for 2014, the company's operating margin has improved to 8.5% as of 1H15 and the company is targeting to achieve 10%+ operating margins.I believe that it is entirely likely in the coming quarters as FedEx has a $4.2 billion capital expenditure for FY15 that is targeted towards modernizing the company's fleet.The direct implication is lower operating cost as B757 fleet introduction would potentially mean a 20% cost improvement and B767 fleet introduction would mean a 30% cost improvement as compared to the earlier fleet. Therefore, UPS faces margin compression while FedEx is on the path to margin expansion and the results are also clear on considering the last few quarter performance.In conclusion, UPS does have an attractive dividend payout of $2.68 as compared to a dividend payout of $0.8 for FedEx. However, on several other fronts, the company is underperforming while FedEx has been outperforming. Therefore, my view is that investors avoid UPS and consider exposure to FedEx for 2015."
2972436,42201,2015-03-05T10:00:10-05:00,"FedEx's dividend yield is extremely low at only 0.45%.Growth expectations for FDX are higher than for UPS. Still, UPS might be a better stock if you expect to need income in the near future.Paying a small dividend leaves FDX with plenty of cash to buy back large amounts of its own stock, boosting EPS.","In August of last year, I recommended buying shares in FedEX (NYSE:FDX) at a price of $148.06. Shares have since climbed by 19.4% and are now trading at $176.80. The increase in price has pushed the dividend yield down to only 0.45%, which means the stock isn't very interesting for those in need of current income.FDX data by YChartsEarnings per share for FDX stand at $7.94, giving the company a price to earnings multiple of 22.3.This is 13.8% higher than its 5-year average p/e ratio of 19.6. However, with analysts expecting FDX to have earnings per share of $8.97 in the current fiscal year, the forward p/e ratio is much lower, at only 19.7.Average analyst estimates for EPS growth in the next 5 years stand at 16.2%. This is much higher than the expected growth rate of 9.3% for United Postal Service (NYSE:UPS), which is also trading at a forward p/e ratio of 19.7.If analyst expectations are correct, we could see earnings per share of $16.82, 5 years from now. This means investors getting in at the current price are paying 10.5 times expected earnings in FY 2020.In the graph below, I have also added a pessimistic scenario, where the company misses analyst expectations by a wide margin, with a 5-year EPS growth rate of only 10%, and an optimistic scenario in which the company's average EPS growth rate over the next 5 years is 20%.FDX Dividend Per Share (5-Year Growth) data by YChartsOver the past 5 years, FDX has grown its dividend by an average of 6.4% annually. While this isn't a terrible growth rate, the very low current yield means it may take decades to get a reasonable yield on cost.Fortunately, the company does return capital to its shareholders by repurchasing stock. Over the past twelve months alone, FDX has spent $4.22 billion in share repurchases. For comparison, total dividends costs were only $206 million.FDX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsFDX's revenue has been growing at a pace of around 5% in recent years. The 3-year revenue growth rate stands at 5.12%, which is quite reasonable. For the current fiscal year, analysts expect the company to have revenues of $47.7 billion, which would be an increase of 4.8% to last year's $45.6 billion. A further 5.6% increase to $50.4 billion is expected next year.FDX PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLooking at the price to sales ratio, we can see it has gone up significantly. The 5-year average p/s ratio for FDX stands at 0.8, which is well below the trailing twelve month p/s ratio of 1.1. However, I feel this can be justified by the company's growing profit margin. For comparison, UPS has a trailing twelve month p/s ratio of 1.6, while its profit margin is only slightly higher than FDX's, at 5.12%.FDX Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsLooking at the balance sheet we can see FDX's short-term financial health remains excellent, despite the fact the company saw its cash decrease as a result of stock buybacks. The current ratio of 1.78 is much higher than UPS' 1.37. FDX still has $2.27 billion in cash and equivalents, which is 4.5% of the company's current market cap of $50.12 billion.Going forward, I can see several positive catalysts for FDX. Gas prices are currently quite low. FDX expects this will have a positive influence on 2015's EPS. Furthermore, according to Bigcommerce.com, ecommerce is growing at a rate of 30% annually, with global sales expected to reach $2 trillion in 2015. The United States SMB ecommerce is expected to reach $100 billion, which is more than the worldwide revenues of Amazon and eBay combined.All these goods have to be transported, which is great news for FedEx. FDX's recent acquisition of GENCO shows the company's dedication to grow in the ecommerce segment.I expect FDX will continue its stock buybacks, lowering the amount of outstanding shares and thus, increasing earnings per share. Steady revenue growth and a stable profit margin combined with a perfect balance sheet should allow the company to grow EPS at a healthy pace. The massive increase in share price over the past six months has pushed up valuations quite a bit. However, I feel strong growth expectations can justify a somewhat higher p/e and p/s ratio.If you don't need current income to cover your living expenses, FDX might be a great stock to buy and hold. Eventually, I believe EPS growth will result in higher dividends, even if the company keeps its payout ratio very low. However, if you expect to need income from your stocks within the next decade, UPS might be a better choice.Disclaimer: I am not a registered investment advisor and do not provide specific investment advice.

2776325,67775,2014-12-23T11:50:17-05:00,"Earnings missed, however fundamentals still strong.Improving macro environment is a plus.Near term appreciation expected with decreasing fuel prices.My Levered Returns model calculates fair value of approximately $179.","OverviewFew companies enjoy the luxury of their brand names being used as a verb. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is one of them. The company is a global leader in ""express"" parcel delivery and also has sizeable market share in the emerging ""ground"" segment. Given the gradual economic recovery in the U.S., significant growth in e-commerce, and decreasing fuel prices, I believe good times are ahead for the company.Earnings Missed, However Fundamentals Still StrongFDX recently announced FQ2 EPS of $2.14, missing estimates by $0.08, and falling by around 3% in the process. Revenue targets were also missed, by $80 million, at $11.9 billion which brought the stock down to $167.78. I took a number of factors under consideration in my analysis, such as improving macroeconomic climate, boosting e-commerce shipments, and a profit plan underway. The most important aspect, falling jet fuel prices would also have an impact, even though more in the short term. My Levered Returns model calculates the fair value of the stock around $179, mostly driven by margin expansion.Double Benefits: Improving Online Sales and Macroeconomic ClimateEcommerce, one of the proving grounds of FedEx, has had a strong start in the current holiday season. ComScore has reported 11% y/y growth in ecommerce sales for the month of November. The Thanksgiving-Cyber Monday sales were even better at +24% y/y. An improving economy is also bound to have a positive effect. The U.S. economy has been growing consistently, adding jobs quarter after quarter, specifically since spring. The current unemployment rate stands in the 5.2-5.5% range, the lowest since 2009.Fuel Prices Under FocusDeclining fuel prices will benefit the stock, specifically in the short term. Crude oil prices are down more than 50% after the announcement of OPEC on the 27th, to maintain production at current levels. More relevant for the company are prices for jet fuel that drives the company's fleet, and have come down 10%/5% m/m in October/November. However, the effect of this will likely be in the short term, as transportation costs will also be revised downwards.Levered Return Valuation ModelI am assuming a 5% revenue growth rate for next year. Thereafter, I project a decline to 3.5% for the long term, which is conservative as the CAGR for last ten years stands at 4.5%. These assumptions, along with margins expanding to 18.5%, result in an enterprise value of ~$55 billion, from which I subtract the net debt at $2.5 to come to an equity value of ~52 billion implying a fair value of approximately $179 per share.ConclusionFedEx has significant long term potential, given a strong foothold in a growing industry. Furthermore, the company may hold additional attraction in the short run as well, given falling fuel prices and a strong start to the current e-commerce season. Either way, the company is a good investment for the long, as well as short term investor."
2822366,39011,2015-01-16T07:18:40-05:00,"FDX shares have continued to rally since my last article on the company.
        Despite the rally I still think FDX is undervalued and will continue to move higher.
        Macro tailwinds for earnings will continue to drive value for shareholders.","Shipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has seen the meteoric rise in its stock that began in 2012 continue all the way up to $183 late in 2014. At that price the rally gave FDX holders a clean double for an enormous company in a ""boring"" industry in under two years. That amazing feat is terrific enough on its own but with macro tailwinds still pushing FDX earnings higher, is there more left in this rally? In this article I'll take a fresh look at FDX and see if there is still some value to be had at $172.To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here. It uses basic inputs including earnings estimates, which I've sourced from Yahoo!, dividends, which I've set to grow at 10 cents annually, and a discount rate, which I've set as the 10 year Treasury plus a risk premium of 6.5%.We can see the model has produced a fair value of $197, a lofty target that is roughly $25 in excess of where the stock trades today. What's more encouraging about this is that the model is intended to be conservative and provide a margin of safety, further strengthening the argument that FDX shares are cheap. Let's take a look at the fundamentals and what has changed since I last looked at FDX a few months ago.When I looked at FDX in October the stock was trading at $158 after an enormous move up. Little did the market know that FDX still had tons of steam left in the rally and it subsequently powered higher past $180 as we saw earlier. At the time I said that $200 was in sight in a relatively short timeframe for FDX and I still believe that; my model assessed fair value at $197 today.FDX still has the tremendous macro tailwind of ever-growing commerce meaning a higher pool of business from which to draw each year. This tailwind is in effect for all shippers and it helps everyone; FDX is not excluded. The other tailwind that is helping FDX is fuel prices. I mentioned this one in my last profile of the company but at the time, I had no idea oil would break below $45. Since my article, of course, oil has collapsed in epic fashion and that has led to much lower gasoline and diesel prices which certainly helps companies that move things around for a living. The tailwind for FDX in this area is even larger than I had previously thought it would be and that's a positive for the stock.In a somewhat unsurprising move, analysts have moved FDX' earnings estimates up slightly in the past few months. FDX is now expected to post lofty earnings growth of better than 16% for the foreseeable future and while that's a lot of growth for a $50 billion company, I don't have any doubt it can be done. With revenue growth in the mid-single digit area, high operating margin growth and the reduction in shares due to the buyback, 16% should be very achievable and that is why analysts have been ratcheting up estimates.Even after the rally we've seen FDX is still trading for only 15 times forward earnings, a ridiculous multiple considering the company's size, scale and projected earnings growth. Companies with far fewer catalysts for growth and complete lack of a moat - neither of which are maladies FDX suffers from - trade in the 20+ forward earnings range. A below market multiple on FDX is a joke and whether that gets rectified by the market coming down or by FDX continuing to move up, it looks good for FDX.I still like FDX even after the move up. The company is still a dominant player in its industry, an industry which is very difficult to disrupt. It also is retiring large amounts of shares and macro tailwinds will drive revenue and margin growth for years to come. FDX management has proven prudent in capital deployment and strategic decisions so there really isn't much not to like. If you think people will stop shipping things then FDX is not for you but if you live on this planet, FDX is worth a look."
2839416,56732,2015-01-22T02:27:29-05:00,"As a cyclic business, FedEx’s financial performance is closely correlated to the stable growth in trade volume and GDP growth.The US economy expects to experience stable growth during 2015. Various economic indicators present a healthy economic outlook for the company.FedEx is well-positioned to benefit from the stable economic outlook. The stable economic outlook of 2015 will help FedEx to achieve its short and long-term goals.","FedEx's Financial PerformanceThe demand for FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) services is closely linked to the growth in the trade volume and trade volume in turn is closely correlated to the growth in real GDP. A strong correlation between the growth in the real GDP and world trade volume can be seen in the following chart.Source: FedEx WebsiteStable Economic Outlook of the US and FedExFedEx's financial performance is closely linked to the economic cycle and for this reason FedEx's financial performance forecast is heavily based on the economic forecast. As a cyclic business, FedEx's stock price is very sensitive to the fear of economic slowdown and recession. Economic stability in the US maintains the stability of many other major economies of the world and FedEx has a large exposure in the US economy. Let us have a look at a few important US economic indicators to form an informed opinion of the US economic outlook and assess FedEx's financial performance for 2015.Accelerating GDP GrowthIt is encouraging to see that US GDP growth is accelerating and economists are optimistic about the US economic outlook for 2015. Stable economic growth means growth in trade and commerce and this in turn means revenue and earnings growth for FedEx. If we look at the five quarters from Q3 of 2013 to Q3 of 2014, it becomes clear that the US GDP has grown by a healthy rate of 3.5% or above with the exception of Q1 2014 that was affected by the bad weather.Stable Growth in Consumer SpendingThe economy is expected to remain under the control of the Federal Reserve and the current GDP growth trend is expected to continue for at least two more years. The fall in oil prices along with other factors is expected to increase consumer spending which will lead to growth in demand. Moreover, the 2008 recession's effects still linger and will make consumers increase their spending in line with the growth in their income and this factor will play a role in the stability of the demand-supply mechanism of credit and the functioning of the financial system. Discipline in spending patterns on the part of consumers correlates with the growth in their earnings level and is important for economic stability. These factors mean growth in FedEx's revenue in the coming quarters with an added element of stability.Optimism among Businesses will Increase InvestmentBusiness spending is already strong and growing. During 2015, businesses are expected to increase spending and expand their operations to cater to the growth in demand. If we look at the small business Optimism Index published by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), we can see that the index is showing an upward trend and it is nearing the historical average recorded before the 2008 recession. This optimism shows that small businesses are confident about the economic stability and business environment and expect to increase investments in order to meet the growing demand for goods and services. Increased optimism of businesses will increase investments which will in turn cause them to increase the supply of their products to match the growing demand. These are important factors that keep inflation under control and allow the stable functioning of the economy. These aspects augment a stable economic outlook that is necessary for FedEx to enjoy a stable financial performance.Source: National Federation of Independent BusinessesThe Growth in HousingSo far, the growth in the number of housing starts was much lower compared to the level considered to indicate an oversupply. Presently, housing starts are also expected to grow in line with the demand for new houses. Therefore, this economic indicator is expected to remain within comfortable limits and will contribute to a stable economic environment.Improvement in the Job CreationJob creation has also accelerated in recent quarters and that means an increase in earnings which will result in an increase in consumer spending. Increased consumer spending and the shift to online retail mean that FedEx will see growth in its revenues and earnings.FedEx is Well-Positioned to Capitalize on the Favorable Economic EnvironmentFedEx is aiming for a long-term operating margin of at least 10% and annual EPS growth between 10% and 15%. FedEx is also aiming for a short term goal of $1.6 billion in annual profits by the end of FY 2016. The economic outlook for 2015 will support FedEx's goal of reaching these targets. FedEx is a very well-run company that is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the favorable economic conditions. The consensus target price for FedEx shows a 5% upside at its current price level. FedEx is a good investment for those who want to benefit from the improving economic conditions of the US economy.ConclusionFedEx is a cyclical business and its stock is sensitive to the economic outlook of the US. Various economic indicators, including accelerating GDP growth, expected growth in consumer spending, and business optimism indicate a stable economic environment in the US. FedEx is a very well-run company that is in a very good position to capitalize on the economic growth that the US economy is expected to experience in 2015. Investors that want to invest in a strong company and want to benefit from the economic growth should consider investing in FedEx."
2764225,58341,2014-12-18T21:00:01-05:00,"FedEx missed Q2 EPS estimates by $0.08 per share and revenue by $100M.The recent correction puts the stock's valuation at a cheap forward PEG ratio of 0.72x.Despite the quarterly miss, FedEx is still growing earnings in the 20%-30% range and north of 5% on the top line.The company recently acquired GENCO and Bongo International to benefit the e-commerce side of the business.Freight segment revenue rose 11% and operating margins jumped 130 basis points.","On December 17th, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported quarterly top and bottom line results that disappointed many investors. EPS for the second quarter was $2.14 per share vs. the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.22 per share ($1.57 per share in Q2 FY14) and revenue came in light at $11.9B vs. the $12B estimate (4.4% year over year increase). Operating income topped $1B and net income picked up to $616M in the quarter, a rise of 22% and 23%, respectively. Overall operating margins increased 120 basis points to 8.5%.FedEx's Express segment, which makes up the majority of sales, saw revenues rise 3% to $7.02B. The operating margin expansion by 170 basis points to 6.9% was led by U.S. package volumes growing 7% and 5% for International Economy. The Ground segment did see margins decline 20 basis points, but still remains the highest in the company at 15.2%. The jump in average daily package volumes by 5% and revenue per package by 3% pushed the segment's revenues north of $3B (8% year over year increase). FedEx SmartPost, efficient, economical low-weight shipping for the residential side, revenue per packaged rose 7% in the second quarter, but volumes dropped 4% due to one major customer. Finally, Freight, the third major segment, is the smallest and fasting growing for FedEx. In Q2 revenue grew 11% to $1.59B and operating margins ticked up 130 basis points to 7.1%. The 8% spike in less-than-truckload (LTL) average daily shipments and 3% bump up in revenue per shipment led to the outperformance.The company did reaffirm the FY15 EPS guidance of $8.50-$9.00 per share, but this was another disappointment to Wall Street as estimates were calling for $9.11-$9.14 per share for the current fiscal year. At the mid-point of the range, it would be a near 30% jump in earnings from the previous year's $6.75 per share.Just this week FedEx has announced two major acquisitions. The first was GENCO, a third-party logistics company, which had revenue of $1.6B in the last year. The details of the deal weren't disclosed, but the company processed 600M+ items annually from 130 different operations. This acquisition is an addition to the supply chain management that is much needed by an ever-growing e-commerce presence for FedEx. To complement the GENCO deal, FedEx also purchased Bongo International for an undisclosed amount. Bongo is a service provider enabling international e-commerce orders and shipments. Bongo has cross-border services in roughly 200 countries for over 2,000 retailers.ValuationShares of FedEx trade at a forward P/E ratio of 15.20x (FY16 estimates ending in May 2016) with 21.1% EPS growth, price to sales ratio of 1.07x, and a price to book ratio of 3.26x. Annual revenue growth is expected to top 5% over the next two years, pushing above $50B by FY16. This compares to United Parcel Service UPS, FedEx's largest competitor, which trades at a forward P/E ratio of 19.21x (FY15 estimates ending in December 2015) with 13.9% EPS growth, price to sales ratio of 1.73x, and a price to book ratio of 1.73x. UPS is also expected to see 5%+ sales growth in the near future. With the exception of the price to book ratio, FedEx trades at a lower valuation/higher earnings growth compared to UPS.Of the 16 Wall Street analysts that cover FDX shares, 9 have buy ratings and 1 has a strong buy rating. Cowen and Citigroup (C])have the highest price targets on the street at $210, while the average target is nearly 7% higher than the current price at $179.29.Technical AnalysisThe two-year weekly chart above shows FDX shares have been trading in a solid uptrend since April of 2013. In just the previous two weeks, the stock has pulled back more than 8% and is now nearing a retest of the bottom of the channel. At the same time the relative strength index (RSI) is coming in for a return to the 50 reading, an area where buyers have typically stepped into the stock. If FedEx shares can't attract buyers in the low-$160s it could retest the 40-week simple moving average (also the 200-day simple moving average) about $10 lower.Even though the results for the second quarter and guidance for FY15 didn't meet Wall Street's high expectations, we have to keep in mind that there was a $0.07 EPS miss in Q2 2014 as well. The company managed to overcome a mishap in the holiday season last year too, posting the highest ever quarterly profit in Q4 FY14. Shares of FDX are now at a point (near correction territory at 8%+ off of the highs) where investors can pick up the stock at a forward PEG ratio of 0.72x and a price to sales ratio just above 1x on a company that is seeing 20%-30% earnings growth combined with a consistent buyback track record (accounting for $0.16 per share in the latest quarter and $0.15 in the prior quarter). On September 15th, FedEx announced a new 15M share repurchase program, or $2.5B+ at current levels. The company generated negative free cash flow of $1M compared to -$438M in FCF in the year-ago quarter (due to increases in capital expenditures Q2 has been negative in recent years). Despite that, FedEx still has a strong balance sheet with more than $2.2B in cash.The recent acquisitions of GENCO and Bongo International are likely to start benefiting FedEx in the next few quarters as they are integrated into the e-commerce side of the business. Along with the tailwind of declining fuel prices in the last two quarters, investors should benefit from lower costs at FedEx in the next year and possibly beyond. With everything considered, the short-term hiccup from the second quarter results gives long-term investors a chance to buy on a dip."
2765975,24276,2014-12-19T11:07:07-05:00,"Both FedEx and UPS fell yesterday on FedEx' earnings miss.Both are fully priced and expecting only moderate growth.Neither is presently a bargain, although UPS is a slightly better buy based on yield.","It's the age-old question. Like Coke (NYSE:KO) or Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), GM (NYSE:GM) or Ford (NYSE:F), Yankees or Red Sox.Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) or UPS (NYSE:UPS)?It's being asked again in the wake of FedEx' earnings miss, caused not by the drop in fuel prices but by the way the company worked to protect customers from past increases.It turns out Federal Express doesn't just buy fuel the way you and I buy fuel. It uses hedges, based on the previous week's or month's price, in order to even out this key cost. And it uses fuel surcharges in its pricing, which it cuts when its own fuel costs go down, meaning savings are passed on to customers.As a result the dramatic drops in jet fuel prices during its most recent quarter, ending in November, provided ""only a slight benefit to operating income"" and, while the numbers were good -- $616 million in profit, $2.15 per share, on $11.939 billion in revenue - they fell short of analyst estimates.Given the explanation, you really want to blame analysts who don't know how the company operates. And the same analysts quickly covered their backsides by downgrading UPS, which fell $1.28/share yesterday while FDX was going down $6.48.So, again. FDX or UPS? After all, you're not buying what they did last month, but what they'll do next year.The fact is that right now you'll pay up for either. Federal Express has a Price/Earnings multiple of 22.83 on a $49.48 billion market cap. The price for UPS is 26.92 times earnings on a $99.88 billion market cap.Both seem to me to be fully priced. Neither is growing their top-lines rapidly, and neither brings even 10 cents of sales to the net income line in a given year. The balance sheet shows more debt on the UPS side, over 25% of assets, but that of FedEx is rising, and is now approaching 15% of assets. While UPS shares are more volatile, both are up nearly the same amount over the last five years - 87% for UPS, 90% for FDX - better than the Dow Jones average, not as good as the NASDAQ.We usually think of FedEx as the Air Force and UPS as the ground troops, but as paper is sent less-and-less often the two companies are becoming more similar. In fact, FedEx just bought privately-held Genco, which handles returns for many e-commerce companies and generated $1.6 billion in revenue last year. UPS' acquisition this month is Poltraf, a health logistics outfit out of Poland.So the easy answer is you buy UPS for its yield of 2.47%, although FDX has delivered far more in capital gains during 2014, 16.7% vs. 3.3% for UPS, and right now it's cheaper.I should tell you to buy UPS, because their headquarters is near where my wife works and she takes the bus with many of their office employees in the morning. But that would be silly.The real answer is that, right now, you pass on both, because why pay a Google price for a package delivery outfit when Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the biggest customer for both, is doing all it can to stop using them? Both are expensive based on an assumption that the economy is poised for take-off, which will be reflected in more package deliveries, but in his conference call yesterday even FDX CEO Frederick Smith is predicting only ""modest"" growth going forward."
2762545,50662,2014-12-18T10:25:30-05:00,"FedEx reported a net profit increase, thanks to higher revenues and just slightly higher expenses. The EPS was also fueled by a share buyback.I don’t find any surprises in this financial update, and I think the market’s expectations might have been a bit too high.I’m still on the sidelines as FedEx isn’t particularly cheap right now.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has reported its financial results for the second quarter of its financial year 2015, and in this update I'll briefly discuss these results as the expectations were quite high. The company's total revenue indeed increased by roughly 5% to $11.9B which is mainly due to a 11% increase in the freight segment and an 8% increase in the Ground segment. As the total operating expenses increased by just 3%, FedEx operating margin jumped by 22% which is a great achievement and seems to be ignored by the market.Source: press releaseThe average tax rate decreased slightly to 36.56% compared to 36.86% in the same period last year. The net profit increased substantially to $616M which is a 23% increase. However, the earnings per share jumped by 36% thanks to the lower amount of outstanding shares, as FedEx has been buying back its shares quite aggressively. Looking at the cash flow statements, FedEx spent $947M on share buybacks in the first six months of its financial year. That's less than in the previous year, but its total amount of outstanding shares is steadily going down which obviously has a huge impact on the earnings and free cash flow per share. Talking about the free cash flow, in H1 of this year, FedEx' financial statements show the company was free cash flow positive to the tune of $855M if you exclude the changes in working capital. That's okay, but is less than last year, and the company spent more on dividends and share buybacks in H1 FY 2015 than the amount of free cash flow it generated, so it's not really a surprise to see its working capital position to decrease by in excess of $300M. The total liabilities decreased as well, but this seems to be mainly due to a lower pension obligation (see next image), which is just an accounting trick.Source: press releaseFedEx performed quite well in H1 2015, but all eyes will be on Q3 as the holiday season is by far the company's most important time of the year. I'm somehow disappointed that the company isn't able to increase its guidance despite the much lower fuel price on the world market. This could, however, have several reasons. First of all, it's not unlikely it has hedged its fuel cost, but in that case I do think we'll see a lower cost from FY 2016 on. On the other hand, it's also entirely possible the company will pass on the majority of its cost savings to its customers. This could result in FedEx gaining more market share as well, so I hope to hear some more information about that as well. The company's share price is up by roughly 20% in the past year, and that makes it a bit too expensive for me. I'm on the sidelines despite the good financial results. The put options I wrote last year expired worthless but right now I'm not even writing put options neither until the share price comes down a bit."

FedEx is a major competitive force in the shipping industry, benefiting from the rise of e-commerce and increasing demand for expedited shipping solutions.On Wednesday, the company reported earnings that disappointed some investors, given the positive tailwinds of low gasoline prices and strong consumer sentiment. FedEx missed EPS estimates by $0.08. Revenues and FY15 guidance were in line however, suggesting that expectations had gotten ahead of themselves and favorable conditions have not yet hit the bottom line. Looking at the various operating segments, Express and Freight volumes were up, while Ground disappointed.Prior to its earnings report, FedEx announced it was acquiring privately-held logistics provider Genco, further bolstering its e-commerce business. The Genco acquisition adds new best in class supply chain management capabilities. The deal, which likely cost FedEx $1-$2 billion, is the largest acquisition the company has made since it acquired Watkins Motor Lines in 2006 for $780 million and rivals its 2004 purchase of Kinko's for $2.4 billion. It also announced another small acquisition, Bongo International, a provider of services that enables international e-commerce orders and shipments.I last wrote about FedEx back at the beginning of October. At the time, the company appeared on track for a strong holiday season. It was also coming off a strong earnings quarter reported in September, had instituted a large share repurchase and increased its dividend.Since October, FedEx stock has certainly delivered. In my opinion, today's pullback creates a buying opportunity.So let's take another look at this stock. All data sourced from the Best Stocks Now app.FedEx is a $49.3 billion company in the transportation sector. It is a Large Cap stock, which should continue to do well in the current risk-averse market environment. Its risk profile is Conservative.FedEx's valuation is also quite reasonable, trading at a forward P/E of around 16. Its estimated five-year annual growth rate is a robust 16+%. Not bad for a mature company. It also delivers a dividend yield of .50%, which as previously mentioned continues to increase. FedEx receives a Value Grade of B+.FedEx stock is now up more than 22% this year versus the 7.6% return for the S&P 500. Over the last 12 months, shares have risen more than 25%. And on a 3, 5, and 10-year annualized basis, FedEx has been a consistent outperformer. FedEx receives a Momentum Grade of B+ and a Performance Grade of B-. It is a solid performer among large cap names.FedEx ranks #192 out of the 3600+ stocks I follow in the Best Stocks Now universe and receives an overall Stock Grade of A-.I own FedEx stock in my Growth and Income accounts. It is a company that is executing well and is leveraged to online shopping and e-commerce. It is benefiting from lower gas costs and higher shipping rates. Thanks to positive consumer sentiment, people are shopping and shipping at record levels.FedEx has been capturing market share from its rival UPS (NYSE:UPS), thanks to its superior service and infrastructure. So despite the earnings disappointment, FedEx maintains a strong competitive position, bolstered by its latest e-commerce acquisition. Economic tailwinds for FedEx are also extremely favorable, driven by low gas prices and robust consumer demand. Given all these positives, FedEx should continue to deliver and today's pullback is a buying opportunity for investors.Follow me on Twitter @billgunderson for a change of opinion on this stock."
2768625,23164,2014-12-20T09:54:34-05:00,"Even with the global economy slowing down, FedEx has reaffirmed the EPS guidance for FY15.Lower fuel cost is one of the important margin expansion factors in the coming quarters.Fleet renewal in 2015 and 2016 will also contribute to long-term margin expansion.FedEx looks attractive from a forward PE perspective and the company's focus on high margin and high ROIC ground business will deliver value for shareholders.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has seen a strong year with the stock surging by 21.3% YTD. I believe that the rally for FedEx will continue into 2015 and this article discusses some of the key reasons to remain bullish on FedEx. While the company's financial results have been discussed in details in few other recent articles in Seeking Alpha, I will focus on a few finer aspects of the results and the growth drivers.One of the major positive factors for FedEx is the recent decline in oil prices. The decline in oil prices has impacted the company's margin in 2Q15 and will continue to impact the key margins over the next few quarters.To put things into perspective, FedEx's fuel cost for the second quarter of 2015 was 8.8% of the revenue as compared to the fuel cost being 10% of the revenue in the second quarter of 2014.The key point here is that the global economy is weakening and there is a supply glut of oil. The implication is that oil prices can remain in the range of $60 to $70 per barrel in the coming year. Therefore, the benefit of lower fuel prices will continue for FedEx.An important point related to the global slowdown and fuel cost is the company's EPS guidance for 2015. FedEx has reaffirmed an EPS guidance of $8.5 to $9.0 per share for 2015. The guidance has been reaffirmed even after a slowdown in the global economy as is clearly evident from the chart below.Therefore, it is interesting that the EPS guidance has been reaffirmed even with the global economy slowing down. There are two reasons for the reaffirmation of EPS guidance -From a margin perspective, I want to add here that the company's operating margin has improved to 8.5% in 2Q15 as compared to 7.3% in 2Q14. The company's long-term goal is to achieve an operating margin of 10% and I believe that this is possible with fuel efficient fleet coming in 2015 and 2016.Besides the margin expansion that is likely to come from renewal in fleet, the company's operating margin is also likely to benefit from bigger investment in the higher margin and higher ROIC ground business. Further, the recent acquisition of Bongo International, which increases the company's e-commerce segment, is also positive for margins over the long-term.Therefore, from a margin expansion perspective, FedEx is making the right moves and I expect the company's EPS to get a boost on higher operating margin besides the impact of higher revenue.From a valuation perspective, FedEx expects an EPS of $8.5 to $9.0 for the current year. If the mid-range of the guidance is considered, an EPS of $8.75 is likely in the current year and FedEx is therefore trading at a 2015 PE of 19.9.Further, FedEx expects EPS growth to be in the range of 10% to 15% over the long-term. While the company's EPS growth for the first half of 2015 has been 37%, even if an EPS growth of 15% is considered for FY16, the likely EPS will be $10 and FedEx is trading at roughly 17 times FY16 EPS.I believe that these valuations are attractive considering the strong margin expansion and growth plans lined-up. I therefore believe that FedEx will continue to trend higher and investors can consider exposure to the stock at current levels."
2765375,65713,2014-12-18T08:01:38-05:00,FedEx currently has a market cap of $49 billion and a dividend yield of 0.5%.This article looks at how fuel costs flow to the independent contractor.The Ninth Circuit court has also given a ruling with regard to the issues surrounding independent contractors and FedEx. FedEx is currently petitioning the Appeals court for a review.,"The scope of this article discusses the impact of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) independent contractors within the business model. This analysis is relevant because investors are scouring the market for beneficiaries of lower fuel prices.Within the business model, the employees are working in the hub and terminal, while the contractors are working in the FedEx vehicles. The below picture illustrates the independent contractor model :Source: Becoming a FedEx ContractorIt is key to understand that a FedEx Ground contractor is not an employee, but a small business. These small businesses serve various functions:Recent Legal ActivityCurrently, FedEx is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that the owner-operators should be treated as employees, rather than independent contractors. These include 26 class action lawsuits, individual lawsuits and state tax proceedings.On August 27, 2014, the Ninth Circuit decided that plaintiffs in California and Oregon were employees as a matter of law. FedEx is currently asking the Ninth Circuit court to reconsider and is petitioning for an 'en banc' review by the Appeals court. FedEx established an accrual for loss which is a requirement of GAAP standards when a probable loss can be estimated.The dollar amount of that accrual was not disclosed, but was regarded as immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.However, this Ninth Circuit court decision has been the first disclosed adverse determination related to FedEx Ground's independent contractors. The ruling might entitle certain of owner-operators and their drivers to reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wages and work hours. In short, FedEx Ground may have to overhaul the independent contractor status of FedEx Ground's owner-operators in certain jurisdictions where the Ninth Circuit ruling applies.Fuel Expenses and the Contractor ModelBelow is a discussion of how the contractor model affects the income statement and the fuel prices faced by FedEx.The following graph shows the average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the five most recent quarters. Also, note that Q1 of 2015 is the period with the Three Months Ending 8/31/2014. The company has a year end of May 31.Table #1 compares operating expenses expressed as dollar amounts (in millions) and as a percent of revenue for the three-month periods ended August 31:In the above chart, the contractors are paid on the Purchased Transportation line of the income statement. The management and the employees of FedEx are expensed on the ""Salaries and Benefits"" line item. Because contractors are paying for the fuel, the depreciation of their tractor, and other business expenses tied to delivering a package, FedEx is not directly exposed to these expenses.In fact, my estimates are roughly 75% of the fuel purchased by FedEx is jet fuel. Below is a discussion of how I come to this determination.FedEx utilizes an indexed fuel surcharge for all deliveries, and the company does not have any jet fuel hedging contracts.Table #2 sets forth FedEx Express's costs for jet fuel and its percentage of consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years:By comparing Table #1 and #2, about 10% of the company's operating expenses are fuel. Now, by looking at Table#2, we see that Jet Fuel (as a percentage of revenue) is about 8% in the last two fiscal years. Also, this percentage has declined from FY 12 based on investments in fuel efficient jets.Investment in Fuel EfficiencyIn 2013, FedEx retired 10 aircraft and related engines and shortened the depreciable lives of an additional 76 aircraft. These were jets which were inefficient in terms of fuel consumption and apparently required substantial maintenance charges compared to more modern jets.In 2014, FedEx began introducing more efficient, lower-emission Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft (""767F""). The 767F is approximately 30% more fuel efficient and has unit operating costs that are more than 20% lower than the MD10 aircraft it is replacing.Its combination of light, durable aluminum alloy and composite structure helps make the 767-300F lighter than competing freighters.The 767 Freighter is similar in external appearance to 767 passenger airplanes, except for the lack of passenger windows and doors.ConclusionI conclude that FDX is Attractive, but investors must continue to understand the evolution of the independent contractor model. The Ninth Circuit ruling could open up the company to further legal battles, and this could materially change the business model. Also, if certain drivers are reclassified as employees, then FedEx will be responsible for business expenses (most notably tractors and fuel) currently absorbed by the independent contractor. Given this risk, my feeling is that this company is built for the long term and can withstand minor adjustments to management and contractor relationships.Also, given the major investments in fuel efficient jets, FedEx is building strong competitive advantages. Anyone wanting to compete with FedEx will have to outlay enormous amounts of capital, or will be burdened with older jets requiring large amounts of maintenance.FDX trades at a large premium to the S&P 500. The trailing P/E ratio is about 24x compared to an S&P 500 index trading at almost 18x. Also, note that FDX has a below market dividend yield of 0.5% compared to an S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.8%.Though not within the scope of this article, it is also important to understand the rivalry with United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and their largely unionized employee base. I have written on this subject and the healthcare agreement with approximately 125,000 employees recently.The above article is an opinion, and not investment counsel. Investors should consult with a Financial Advisor before investing capital."
2772515,23471,2014-12-22T10:17:11-05:00,"FDX is suitable for Enterprising Investors, but not Defensive Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 8.76% in annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has consistently grown its earnings over the last several years, which will attract many investors immediately. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how FedEx Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.FDX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - November 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFDX Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:FedEx Corporation does fairly well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the high level of debt relative to the net current assets. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.50 in 2011 to an estimated $6.69 for 2015. This is a very strong level of demonstrated growth which is well above the market's implied estimate of 8.76% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. Here, the historical growth in EPSmg over the last five years is around 18.26% per year, which is clearly unsustainable over a long period of time. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur. A significant slowdown would have to occur to justify a price as low as the market is demonstrating. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of FedEx Corporation for greater perspective!"

        Earnings per share and revenue fell short of expectations.
        Returned more than $200 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
        The stock has reacted by falling more than 4%.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX), one of the world's leading providers of shipping, transportation, e-commerce, and other business services, announced second quarter earnings this morning, with the results falling short of Wall Street's expectations, and its stock has reacted by falling more than 4%; let's take a closer look at the results and the company's outlook going forward to determine if we should consider using this weakness as a long-term buying opportunity or if it is a warning sign to stay away.The Weaker-Than-Expected ResultsHere's a summary of FedEx's second-quarter earnings results compared to what analysts had expected and its results in the year ago period:FedEx's earnings per share increased 36.3% and its revenue increased 4.7% year-over-year, and these results were driven by net income rising 23.2% to $618 million and revenue growth in all four of its major segments. Here's a breakdown of the company's revenues and revenue growth by segment:FedEx's operating profit increased 22.5% to $1,013 million and its operating margin showed strength, expanding 120 basis points to 8.5%; these strong results can be attributed to salaries and employee benefits, rentals and landing fees, and depreciation and amortization increasing just 3.8%, 2.3%, and 0.6%, respectively, all of which were outpaced by the company's 4.7% revenue growth.For the quarter, FedEx generated $1,169 million in net cash provided by operations and invested $1,170 million in capital expenditures, resulting in negative free cash flow for the quarter. Fortunately, the company began the quarter with $2,416 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, which it utilized to repurchase $156 million worth of its common stock and pay out $57 million in dividends. FedEx ended the quarter with $2,266 million in cash and cash equivalents, so it could easily accelerate repurchases and raise its dividend in the second half of the fiscal year.Lastly, as a result of its performance in the first six months of the year, FedEx reaffirmed its full year earnings per share outlook on fiscal 2015; this outlook calls for earnings per share in the range of $8.50-$9.00, which would result in growth of 25.9%-33.3% from the $6.75 earned in fiscal 2014.Should You Buy FedEx On The Dip?FedEx is one of the world's leading shipping and transportation providers, and the growing demand for its services led it to a very strong second quarter performance; the company reported year-over-year increases in net income, earnings per share, revenue, and operating profit, while expanding its margins and reaffirming its full year outlook, but its stock has responded by falling over 4% because the results were not as strong as analysts had anticipated.I think this decline in FedEx's stock represents a picturesque long-term buying opportunity, because it now trades at very inexpensive valuations, including less than 18.6 times fiscal 2015's earnings per share estimates of $9.00, less than 15.3 times fiscal 2016's estimates of $10.94, and a mere 13.3 times fiscal 2017's estimates of $12.57. In addition, the company currently pays an annual dividend of $0.80 per share, which gives it a respectable 0.5% yield at current levels. With all of this information in mind, I think long-term investors should strongly consider initiating positions in FedEx today and adding to them on any further weakness provided by the market."
2723665,21305,2014-12-02T06:04:32-05:00,FDX had a great Q1 2015 with operating income rising by 24% year over year.The recent fall in oil prices stands to give FDX windfall profits for the next two reporting quarters. Beats should translate into stock price appreciation.FDX is forecasting an 8.8% rise in volume for this Christmas season year over year.,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services in the United States and internationally. Most basically, it provides shipping services, either priority or non-priority, for all types of business needs. It burns a lot of fuel doing this. In the twelve months ended May 31, 2014, its FedEx Express business spent $3.943B on fuel. Its FedEx Freight segment spent $0.595B on fuel. Its Ground segment spent only $0.017B on fuel. The total is a whopping $4.555B on fuel for fiscal year 2014. The total operating expenses for those three segments was $41.049B. Fuel amounts to about 11% of the total.Since late June 2014, WTI oil prices have fallen from roughly $108/barrel to below $64/barrel during the day on December 1, 2014. That is an approximately 41% drop, and the fall may not be completely over, although oil did bounce upward later on December 1, 2014. FedEx does not hedge on fuel. Instead, it has a system of fuel surcharges to offset higher fuel prices. The current fuel surcharge of 6% is based on the average monthly fuel cost in October. It will be in effect until Jan. 4, 2015. One would presume that the previous 3-month surcharge was based on the average monthly fuel cost in July 2014. The average WTI crude price in July was probably above $100/barrel. October probably averaged about $85/barrel for WTI crude. The above are just ballpark figures from a quick look at a chart.All this means that FedEx should garner considerable monies from fuel surcharges that are probably inappropriate due to actually much lower fuel costs for both Q2 2015 (September - November 2014) and Q3 2015. One might posit that the actual lower fuel costs would amount to an approximate 15% in fuel savings for fiscal Q2 and possibly Q3 2015. Remember that fuel was only about 11% of operating costs in FY2014. That means a 6% surcharge translates into about a 54% purely fuel surcharge, if one only considers direct fuel costs. Of course, this last is over simplistic. Still FedEx will not only be saving considerably on the fuel, it will be gleaning extra monies from the fuel surtax far above the actual fuel costs.A ballpark 15% savings on fuel costs in Q2 2015 will amount to about $171 million in savings for the quarter. For fiscal Q1 2015, FDX had operating income of $987 million. If one ballparks $1B in operating income for Q2 2015 (and it will likely be higher due to the Christmas season), then an approximately $171 million more due to fuel savings would add about 17% to Q2 2015's operating earnings. This is not something to sneeze at.I am sure there will be many expenses found to make this number much less, but even a relatively unexpected 10% increase in operating earnings for Q2 2015 should make FDX nicely outperform its Q2 2015 guidance. One could probably use the same logic for Q3 2015. FDX should definitely benefit. It should exceed guidance. Recently, it has forecast a great 8.8% year over year Christmas season increase in volume. This should make it exceed prior guidance even further. That in turn seems likely to cause the stock price to rise.Few investors get down into the nuts and bolts of the earnings. They only concern themselves with the headlines. That means FDX is probably a great bet for a Christmas rally. Of course, it has also been a top performing company, so it's not a bad company to invest in longer term. If investors choose to do this, they will want to watch out for an economic downturn. There is mounting evidence that one might be coming soon. If investors see one coming, they will probably want to exit FDX. It is a cyclical stock after all.The end of Q1 2015 FDX guidance called for FY2015 EPS of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. This incorporated an increase in shipping rates by an average of 4.9% for US Domestic, US Export, and US Import services. This will still likely take place. FDX manages its fuel costs via the surcharges. These should work more in FDX's favor for both Q2 and Q3. That should mean that FDX will reach the high end of its guidance, or it may possibly exceed its guidance by as much as $300+ million, if it was already planning to meet the high end of its guidance (or exceed it). This is the typical good management strategy of under promising and over delivering, and FDX has good management.In general, FDX has been doing well even without the above. In Q1 2015, it saw revenues of $11.7B. These were up 6% year over year from $11.0B. Operating income was $987 million. This was up 24% from $795 million in the year ago quarter. Operating margin was 8.5%. This was up from 7.2% in the year ago quarter. Net Income was $606 million. This was up 24% from $489 million in the year earlier quarter.FDX in Q1 2015 finished is recent share stock buyback program with the purchase of 5.3 million shares. One would presume that some of those monies would then be more evidently available in Q2 2015. That should make the company look more flush, at least until FDX institutes a new stock buyback program.FDX is putting old airplanes out of service, and it is replacing them with new ones over time. The US new 767 program for this year constitutes 16 new planes. Each one is expected to save the company $10 million per year in costs. Four were already in service by mid September 2014. The other twelve are expected to be delivered by the end of fiscal year 2015. FDX should also benefit in fiscal 2015 from a voluntary buyout program (for employees) that was completed in May 2014. I could go on, but the real point is that FDX management is performing well. FDX is a near-term buy, but it has also been a good longer-term hold. No recent events would make one change one's opinion on that score. Cheaper oil prices should improve its outlook considerably. They may even help US businesses, which would in turn help FDX. The October 2014 statistics for Chicago's O'Hare airport and Houston's George Bush International airport show freight increases of 14.7% and 16.8% respectively year over year. This data bodes well for FDX's business.The two-year chart of FDX provides some technical direction for this trade/investment.The chart above shows an uptrend of more than two years duration. The company management seems to have been doing a great job. There do not seem to be any fundamental reasons that FDX should reverse course now. One could argue that FDX is a bit overpriced. However, this consistent grower probably deserves to sell at a premium. It has a P/E of 24.31 of and an FPE of 16.29. The average analyst's forecast for EPS growth for fiscal year 2015 is 33.80% and for fiscal year 2016 is 20.80%. The average analyst's five-year EPS Growth estimate per annum is 15.34%. FDX pays a 0.40% dividend.With the above numbers FDX can easily justify its valuation. Further the stock has appreciated more than 100% in the last two years. With the current oil price fall, FDX appears to be just that much more of a buy. However, investors should keep in mind that it is a cyclical stock. It fell from about $111 per share to about $43 per share as the Great Recession started. It would likely fall again if the US sees another such downturn. Investors will want to sell if they see this happening. For the present US economic conditions seem sound enough. However, the EU and many other world areas are troubled, and FDX is an international business.Investors can trade into FDX for a possible oil price mediated rise for the next few months. Such a rise will likely be helped along by the QE from the BOJ, the QE from the ECB, and the Carry Trades on both the Yen and the Euro. All of these things should provide a lot of excess liquidity. Some of this will likely make its way into the US stock markets, especially since the USD has been strengthening. Then the foreigners will earn both appreciation on the USD and appreciation on US stocks, or at least they will hope to. If that wasn't enough motivation, the US is also viewed as a safe haven in troubled times. The US stock markets may continue to go up, especially after the ECB makes definite its plans for a new €1 Trillion in QE. This extra liquidity would benefit FDX's stock price, and it would benefit FDX's business by buoying EU businesses. If you are worried about a near-term downturn, you might want to average in, but FDX does look like a good buy. The average analyst agrees with this with a recommendation of 2.1 (a buy).NOTE: Some of the above fundamental fiscal data is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading/Investing."
2752265,32001,2014-12-12T14:29:11-05:00,FDX seeing incredibly beneficial tailwinds in form of lower fuel costs and stronger economy.Fuel cost savings alone will add significantly to EPS.The 4% q3 '14 GDP and stronger consumer will help as well.Fiscal 2015 guidance will be uber-important.,"Fed-Ex (NYSE:FDX) reports their fiscal q2 '15 financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, December 17th, 2014.Analyst consensus is expecting $2.19 in earnings per share (EPS) on $11.97 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 39% and 5% respectively.Just since the September '14 earnings report, FDX's consensus has risen from $2.10 to $2.19 while the consensus revenue estimate has from $11.88 billion to $11.98 billion.In fiscal q1 '15, FDX Express volumes grew 4% (a very nice pop), Ground volume grew 6% and Freight shipments rose 10%.The surprise (in my opinion) was that Freight and Express volumes and profitability were a little better, while Ground, the juggernaut the last few years, saw a little weaker results.For some background on FDX, the company underwent some significant cost saving initiatives starting about 2 years ago, as the Express segment, FDX's largest segment at 59% of revenue and 37% - 38% of operating income.Segment as % of total:* Source: FDX earnings reports and internal spreadsheetFDX's ""profit improvement"" plan, which was announced late in 2013, is a nice way of saying jobs were going to be cut via early retirement offers, and then excess capital would be returned to shareholders via the large share repo plan.The gigantic drop in crude oil prices was a huge plus for the transport company that was well on its way to driving operating leverage.The stock got a huge boost after it traded in the low $100's after the share repo plan was announced, with FDX announcing that it would be repo'ing 32 million shares or roughly 10% of fully diluted shares outstanding.Here is a quick summary of our positives and negatives around the stock today:Positives:1.) On a 4-quarter trailing basis, FDX's fuel costs are roughly $4.5 billion, and represent 10% of total revenues. With crude's price drop, I would think fuel cost savings alone would represent 10% savings or an additional $450 - $500 ml in savings per year (depending on a number of issues) or roughly $1.50 in additional EPS, before additional share repurchases and expense reductions.2.) The ""profit improvement plan"" came at the perfect time.3.) The focus on rationalizing costs / expenses at FDX Express is important: given Express's inability to leverage revenues, the expense reduction takes some pressure off Ground, which is really leveraging its business (see above table).4.) If US economy continues to improve, and GDP growth continues to increase, then volumes should continue to improve. Lower fuel costs and higher volumes is Nirvana for FDX.5.) FDX reaching a 10% operating margin is almost a certainty now.Negatives:1.) You don't want to own this stock if crude oil prices should rise sharply. The fuel surcharge has undoubtedly been taken off, so its re-implementation will lag any crude oil spike.2.) FDX isn't generating a LOT of free-cash-flow so presumably some of the 32 million share repurchase has been funded with long-term debt, which has increased from $1.2 billion to $4.7 billion as of 8/14. FDX's free-cash-flow yield as of the August quarter was just 1%.FDX is looking for 31% EPS growth and 5% revenue growth for fiscal '15, which is tremendous EPS growth, the problem is that it is all ""middle-of-the-income-statement"" driven. Revenue growth over the next few years is expected at 4% - 5%, until global growth starts to engage again, and I wonder how much of the good crude and expense / share repo news is now in the stock ?To be upfront with readers, I sold almost all of our FDX for clients, around $150 per share. While we didn't own Energy at all during this meltdown, I never in a million years thought crude would have this precipitous price drop that we've seen since September 30, 2014.If FDX management maintains current Fiscal '15 consensus of $9.08 in EPS and $47.9 billion in revenue, (y/y growth of 34% and 5%) expect that FDX management is telling you that global growth will be punk and that any fuel cost benefit is being hedged with weaker economies. (I am not suggesting that will happen, but use the 2015 guidance in conjunction with what you know about global economies and global growth.)Not owning any energy exposure for clients coming into q4 '14 was a pretty smart move in terms of client portfolios, but selling FDX at $145 - $150 doesn't look real bright. I thought the stock was fairly valued at $150 per share, given the operating leverage, capital structure, capex as % of cash-flow at 80%v 85%, etc.I do think FDX will report a blow-out quarter Wednesday morning, December 17th. However I can't chase it here, and would wait for a pretty healthy pullback before stepping in here on the long side, and I do want to own it again for clients.(Our recent articles on FDX can be found here, and here.)"
2597235,65313,2014-10-25T19:00:33-04:00,"UPS has outperformed FDX on ESG disclosures for the past five years, but FDX is catching up.Key environmental metrics indicate than UPS may have a more energy efficiency delivery fleet than FDX.Key social metrics indicate that UPS highly values safety and community relations.","ModernGraham has identified United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and as appropriate for Enterprising Investors. For these investors, I am providing another layer of research and analysis that provides insight into both companies' environmental, social and governance (or ESG) performance.Companies, through annual reports such as the 10K and the sustainability report, release corporate ESG data. Our primary source for ESG data is Bloomberg's Professional Finance and ESG database (Bloomberg). Since 2009, corporate ESG data has been available through Bloomberg. If a company sees an error in their public ESG data, it should have a corporate representative contact Bloomberg and get it corrected, as it would with public financial data.Comparing these two well-known airfreight and delivery companies helps drive ESG insights. Table 1 shows the ESG disclosure scores for FDX and UPS for the years 2009 to 2013.Table 1: 2009-2013 ESG Disclosure Scores for UPS and FDXESG Disclosure Scores range between zero (0) (no disclosure) and 100 (full disclosure). Over the past five years, UPS's ESG disclosure score has increased by four (4) points and FDX by 22 points. Essentially, FDX has caught up to UPS from an ESG disclosure perspective, whereas UPS's ESG disclosure score has decreased slightly each of the past four years, probably because UPS has not shown robust continuing improvement in ESG disclosure and performance.Turning to key environmental metrics, we know that the airfreight and delivery industry is energy intensive, so as an investor, I am interested in proxy measurements that get at how well energy is managed by the enterprise as a whole.Table 2: Key Environmental Footprint Metrics for UPS and FDXTotal GHG Emissions (Column 2) include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions measure GHG generated by a company's own operations or, in the case of these two airfreight companies, their delivery fleets. Scope 2 emissions are GHG emissions generated from electricity purchased from utilities. Column 2 shows that UPS emits less Total Greenhouse Gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions (Column 2) compared to FedEx. Column 3 shows that UPS emits 50% less Total GHG as a percentage of total enterprise sales, compared to FedEx. Column 4 shows that both UPS and FedEx generate primarily Scope 1 GHG emissions, due to their delivery fleets, and the metrics suggest that UPS's delivery fleet is more energy efficient than FedEx's, due to lower GHG intensity metrics for UPS.Key environmental metrics, such as those above, help investors compare how well different energy-intensive companies manage such a core business issue. Excess GHG emissions and intensity metrics raise questions about whether one company has a higher cost of doing business, which reduces profits. Also, many business leaders predict and are planning for future GHG regulation -- in some form -- and so the company that operates with energy efficiency now, and seeks continuing improvement, reduces its long-term risk of exposure to future GHG or carbon regulation.Further to our analysis of key ESG metrics for UPS and FDX, Table 3 below raises key social metrics about safety and community relations for these two airfreight and delivery enterprises.Table 3: Key Social Footprint Metrics for UPS and FDXFor 2012 and 2013, UPS experienced a Lost Time Incident Rate that was 50% lower that FDX's. This metric is the total number of incidents resulting in lost time from work, per 200,000 hours worked or per 100 full-time equivalent employees, assuming employees work 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. This metric certainly affects the cost of doing business, and may reveal how employee and contractor safety is valued at a company. UPS has also disclosed its per-employee training cost (Column 5), whereas FDX has not.Who values this data? Investors seeking long-term investments in maturely positioned companies to absorb identifiable risks and opportunities value the data. Other stakeholders -- such as future and current employees and customers -- value ESG data too. If you want a deeper explanation of this megatrend towards corporate disclosures, browse through the several articles on my website.Disclaimer: The author does not hold a position in any of stocks mentioned in this article, and has no plans to change that position within the next 72 hours."

(NYSE:FDX)FedEx Corp. is a global leader in parcel delivery services and provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. With annual revenues of $45B, the company offers integrated business applications through operating companies competing collectively and managed collaboratively under the respected FedEx brand.Recent Fundamental Highlights (FY end May)FedEx Express provides time-definite express transportation across the globe. This segment generates ~50% of revenue in international markets via its international package and air freight offerings and is 59% of 1Q2015 revenue. As well, average daily package volumes in the US increased a solid +4.8% y/y driven by overnight (expedited/high yield) accelerating +8.9% y/y.FedEx Ground provides small-package ground delivery services in the US and Canada, as well as consolidating business-to-consumer packages for less time-sensitive shipments with final delivery by the United States Postal Service and Canada Post Corporation via the FedEx SmartPost unit. 1Q2015 segment revenue increased 8.4% y/y to $2.96B, as revenue growth via FedEx Ground (+9.3% y/y) was mitigated by revenue via FedEx SmartPost declining 1.3% y/y. Average daily volumes grew 6.1% y/y, primarily driven by growth in e-commerce.FedEx Freight is predominantly comprised of less-than-truckload (LTL) freight services in North America, including a time-definite express freight service offering. 1Q2015 segment revenue grew 13% y/y to $1.6B primarily via continued volume growth (average daily shipments) in its expedited priority offering of +8.0% y/y, while the lower-cost, less time-sensitive economy offering volume grew 5% y/y.Economic MoatExpress continued margin expansion (+130 bps y/y) and was supported by high yielding US overnight package volume (+9% y/y). Volume/yield growth in international priority continued to improve from recent troughs and incremental benefit from FedEx's profit improvement plan, which remains on track to exit FY15 at 75% of the targeted $1.65B of FY16 profit improvements.Ground/freight e-commerce momentum supported a solid +8% y/y revenue growth in ground (high teens margin) and mitigated network expansion costs (to meet e-commerce growth), as the segment returned to y/y margin expansion (+70 bps). Freight, in particular, has segment-operating margins that expanded a strong 340 bps y/y, with continued solid volume growth in priority/cost management contributing.Overall net profit margins can be seen below and reflect the highly competitive industry in which FDX operates.OutlookManagement has reiterated their guidance range of $8.50-$9.00 despite exceeding the 1Q2015 consensus estimate by $0.15 per share. These strong earnings have allowed the company to gain market share in ground from UPS. UPS has had significant issues dealing with bad weather and the peak shipping season which has forced the company to invest heavily in their network. Both companies will hire significant amount of temporary workers to deal with peak season volumes.As the US economy continues to improve, FedEx expects the US economy to continue to lead the way in terms of growth, and forecasts 2014 US GDP growth of 2.1% and 3.1% in 2015. Emerging markets as well should help drive growth for the company, and management continues to expect demand growth.FedEx recently completed a 32M share repurchase program announced in October 2013 and shareholders should expect an announcement of a new plan or a dividend hike. It is expected that management will continue to return capital to shareholders as profits steadily improve as a result of the company's restructuring plans.Major Risks1. Risk of economic downturns and their potential impact on integrated parcel companies2. Risk of doing business abroad, including currency exchange, political and legal risks3. Risk of terrorism and the costs associated with more stringent security requirementsInvestment RationaleFedEx is lauded for its speed and service in its core FedEx segment, where it possesses the leading market share in express parcel delivery in the US, as well as a strong position in its emerging ground segment. Both of these are benefitting from an e-commerce tailwind, which is driving double-digit growth in revenue in B2C.Anticipating a gradual economic recovery in the US and internationally in coming years, margin expansion is expected via improved efficiencies and capital utilization, coupled with a realignment plan targeting improved annual profitability of $1.65B in FY16.FedEx currently trades at $171.73 (price as of Nov 20 at P/E TTM of 23.49) with a 52-week range of $128.17-$172.88 and provides potential upside from current levels over the medium- to long-term as expectations about a stronger y/y peak season and international volumes continue to improve. As well, margin improvement from the $1.6B profit improvement plan should improve bottom line trends."
2704445,76475,2014-11-24T03:44:13-05:00,"Originally just a thought in a term paper, FedEx has grown to be the premiere shipping business in the world.
        FedEx enjoys significant advantages over the competition allowing them to maintain their leadership status in a competitive market.
        Significant growth opportunities exist over both the short and long term.
        Despite potential labor setbacks, FedEx continues to cut costs to increase profitability.
        FedEx a great addition to stock portfolios for investors looking for increased revenue shares combined with long term stability.","For any sound investment, you want to seek out companies that are well established and positioned to prosper during periods of economic growth while also remaining stable enough to survive any unexpected downturns in both the overall economy or the specific market that the business services. While it can be difficult to find businesses that meet both these requirements, few have demonstrated that they are a better choice than FedEx (NYSE:FDX).Company ProfileFedEx began as an idea written in a term paper by Yale University undergraduate Frederick W. Smith in 1965. In 1971, Smith bought controlling interest in Arkansas Aviation Sales located in Little Rock, Arkansas. During his time with the company, he identified the difficulty in moving parcels in only a few days time and began researching efficient delivery systems and giving birth to Federal Express. Official operations began on April 17, 1973 in Memphis and the rest is history.The corporation as we know it today originally formed in January 1998 and since that time the company has seen substantial growth not only in the United States but also on a global scale. Today, FedEx can easily and efficiently deliver packages all over the world in as little as twenty-four hours and is now known as the premier shipping company in the United States.Divisions of FedExFedEx accomplishes its impressive delivery feats by dividing their business into three main segments. FedEx Express offers worldwide delivery within one to three business days and accounts for 60 percent of their business. FedEx Ground, which accounts for 22 percent of their revenue, delivers packages throughout the U.S. and Canada via traditional ground service while the last division, FedEx Freight, ships less-than-truckload delivers and accounts for 12 percent of their business.Advantages Over the CompetitionFedEx operates in a highly competitive market with two, very large rivals - UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. However, FedEx holds several advantages over these rivals. United Parcel Service, for example, faces huge struggles ahead as it works to streamline operations in the face of a very powerful and aggressive union. The U.S. Postal Service has all the problems associated with its government bureaucracy roots while facing financial issues as a result of the government attempting to make it self-sustaining.Position Headed Into 2015In the most recent quarter, FedEx reported earnings of $2.10 per share that were up 37 percent from the same quarter last year. The company posted revenues of $11.7 billion in 2013 that were up 6% from the $11 billion in revenue of the previous year.Going into the holiday season and 2015, the company is well positioned to perform quite strongly. Thanks mainly to the huge growth of online shopping with websites offering many incentives such as free shipping; FedEx is expected to ship a record number of packages as 2014 comes to a close. Large chains are also joining the shipping business as well as they work to combat online shopping and convince people to visit both their online and brick-and-mortar stores. This growth and increased competition represents a big opportunity for FedEx as they work with retailers to provide the best shipping rates and services available.""FedEx Corp. is off to an outstanding start in fiscal 2015, thanks to very strong performance at FedEx Ground, solid volume and revenue increases at FedEx Freight and healthy growth in U.S. domestic volume at FedEx Express,"" said Frederick Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""More customers are relying on FedEx because they appreciate the competitive advantages provided by our broad portfolio of solutions.""Long Term OpportunitiesThe horizons for FedEx go far beyond the next holiday season as FedEx continues to expand its business internationally to include fast-growing markets such as the Middle East, Asia and more. In addition, the company continues to roll out its Priority Alert service contracting with companies such as health care firms that require fast, critical shipments.Potential SetbacksThe Kansas Supreme Court recently issued a ruling that found most contractors in the state should be classified as employees. This decision includes contractors operating in the state from 1998-2007. If this remains in effect, the company's labor costs in the state could increase.Continually Trimming CostsIn an effort to continue to cut costs and run more efficiently, FedEx is currently executing a restructuring plan designed to sell non-core assets and reduce the size of its workforce. As a part of this plan, it is currently offering voluntary buyouts to its employees including up to two years' pay. These efforts should only help the shipping giant increase its profitability and could even help keep shipping rates lower as FedEx is able to ship products cheaper than ever before.Stability and Growth Attractive to InvestorsFedEx has positioned itself as the premiere delivery company in the country, if not the world and they have developed the infrastructure to ensure delivery of packages almost anywhere on the globe. With its advantages over its competitors and its unprecedented efficiency, FedEx looks to further its lead in the delivery markets across the globe that will continue its growth in 2015 and beyond.FedEx offers the stability investors need with a strong ability to withstand any unforeseen downturns in the economy and has positioned itself to significantly grow its business and revenues making it the perfect stock to enhance the portfolios of any investor seeking to shore up their portfolio with a strong performing and relatively safe stock."

Emphasis is on company fundamentals and financial data rather than commentary.Even with their magical powers, Santa's reindeer have their limits. With millions of parcels to be delivered the world over - and not just on Christmas Day but throughout the holiday season - who is going to step up and give Santa and his reindeer a helping hand?The two largest U.S. Air Delivery & Freight Services companies, that's who. United Parcel Service, Inc (NYSE: UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) are already buzzing with activity heading into the most profitable time of their business year. And they just may have a little something extra to deliver this year - extra profits to their shareholders, given their recent stock appreciation and projected earnings estimates.Since the economic recovery began in March of 2009 as graphed below, where the broader market S&P 500 index [black] and the SPDR Industrials ETF (NYSE: XLI) (which both companies are components of) gained 200% and 265% respectively, our two largest U.S. delivery and freight companies put in a split performance, with FedEx greatly outperforming at 400% and UPS slightly underperforming at just 182%.Source: BigCharts.comYet in anticipation of a great year-end as is common with delivery and freight stocks, both companies have vastly outperformed both the broader market and their own sector over the past three months, as graphed below. Where the S&P has risen some 4.7% and the XLI has climbed nearly 7%, FedEx and UPS have soared 15% and 12.4% respectively.Source: BigCharts.comLooking forward, the overall Air Delivery & Freight Services industry is expected to deliver exceptional earnings growth as tabled below, where green indicates outperformance while yellow denotes underperformance.Over the immediate quarters and throughout 2015, the industry's earnings growth is seen outpacing the broader market's average growth at 1.8 to 2.8 times the rate, before settling down to a more tranquil outperformance over the next five years.Zooming-in a little closer, the two largest U.S. companies in the industry are expected to put in a split performance over the immediate term. Where UPS's earnings are seen straddling either side of the broader market's growth rate, FedEx's earnings are expected to vastly outgrow the broader market's average at some 1.94 to 2.64 times its growth rate.Both companies are then seen outgrowing the market in 2015 and beyond, with FedEx outgrowing UPS by about 5 percentage points all the way through.Yet there is more than earnings growth to consider when sizing up a company as a potential investment. How do the two compare against one another in other metrics, and which makes the best investment?Let's answer that by comparing their company fundamentals using the following format: a) financial comparisons, b) estimates and analyst recommendations, and c) rankings with accompanying data table. As we compare each metric, the best performing company will be shaded green while the worst performing will be shaded yellow, which will later be tallied for the final ranking.A) Financial Comparisons• Market Capitalization: While company size does not necessarily imply an advantage and is thus not ranked, it is important as a denominator against which other financial data will be compared for ranking.• Growth: Since revenues and expenses can vary greatly from one season to another, growth is measured on a year-over-year quarterly basis, where Q1 of this year is compared to Q1 of the previous year, for example.In the most recently reported quarter, FedEx posted the greater revenue and earnings growth year-over-year, and by a significant degree in the latter.• Profitability: A company's margins are important in determining how much profit the company generates from its sales. Operating margin indicates the percentage earned after operating costs, such as labor, materials, and overhead. Profit margin indicates the profit left over after operating costs plus all other costs, including debt, interest, taxes and depreciation.Of our two contestants, UPS operated with the widest profit and operating margins, while FedEx contended with the narrowest.• Management Effectiveness: Shareholders are keenly interested in management's ability to do more with what has been given to it. Management's effectiveness is measured by the returns generated from the assets under its control, and from the equity invested into the company by shareholders.For their managerial performance, UPS' management team delivered the greatest returns on both assets and equity where FedEx's team delivered the least.• Earnings Per Share: Of all the metrics measuring a company's income, earnings per share is probably the most meaningful to shareholders, as this represents the value that the company is adding to each share outstanding. Since the number of shares outstanding varies from company to company, I prefer to convert EPS into a percentage of the current stock price to better determine where an investment could gain the most value.Of the two companies here compared, FedEx provides common stock holders with the greater diluted earnings per share gain as a percentage of its current share price.• Share Price Value: Even if a company outperforms its peers on all the above metrics, however, investors may still shy away from its stock if its price is already trading too high. This is where the stock price relative to forward earnings and company book value come under scrutiny, as well as the stock price relative to earnings relative to earnings growth, known as the PEG ratio. Lower ratios indicate the stock price is currently trading at a cheaper price than its peers, and might thus be a bargain.Among our two combatants, FedEx's stock is cheapest relative to forward earnings, company book and 5-year PEG, while UPS's stock is the more overvalued.B) Estimates and Analyst RecommendationsOf course, no matter how skilled we perceive ourselves to be at gauging a stock's prospects as an investment, we'd be wise to at least consider what professional analysts and the companies themselves are projecting - including estimated future earnings per share and the growth rate of those earnings, stock price targets, and buy/sell recommendations.• Earnings Estimates: To properly compare estimated future earnings per share across multiple companies, we would need to convert them into a percentage of their stocks' current prices.Of our two specimens, UPS offers the highest percentages of current and next quarter earnings over current stock price, while FedEx offers the better 2015 earnings percentage.• Earnings Growth: For long-term investors this metric is one of the most important to consider, as it denotes the percentage by which earnings are expected to grow or shrink as compared to earnings from corresponding periods a year prior.For earnings growth, FedEx is projected to deliver the greater growth across all time periods - by a substantial degree over the immediate term, by a moderate degree further out.• Price Targets: Like earnings estimates above, a company's stock price targets must also be converted into a percentage of its current price to properly compare multiple companies.For their high, mean and low price targets over the coming 12 months, analysts believe UPS' stock has the lesser upside potential and lesser downside risk, while FedEx's has the greater upside and greater downside.• Buy/Sell Recommendations: After all is said and done, perhaps the one gauge that sums it all up are analyst recommendations. These have been converted into the percentage of analysts recommending each level. However, I factor only the strong buy and buy recommendations into the ranking. Hold, underperform and sell recommendations are not ranked since they are determined after determining the winners of the strong buy and buy categories, and would only be negating those winners of their duly earned titles.Of our two contenders, UPS is slightly better recommended with 8 strong buys and 7 buys representing a combined 53.57% of its 28 analysts, where FedEx garners 10 strong buy and 4 buy recommendations representing 50% of its 28 analysts.C) RankingsHaving crunched all the numbers and compared all the projections, the time has come to tally up the wins and losses and rank our three competitors against one another.In the table below you will find all of the data considered above plus a few others not reviewed. Here is where using a company's market cap as a denominator comes into play, as much of the data in the table has been converted into a percentage of market cap for a fair comparison.The first and last placed companies are shaded. We then add together each company's finishes to determine its overall ranking, with first place finishes counting as merits while last place finishes count as demerits.And the winner is… FedEx by a greatly oversized parcel, outperforming in 19 metrics and underperforming in 12 for a net score of +7, with UPS reciprocating as it outperforms in 12 metrics and underperforms in 19 for a net score of -7.Where Air Delivery & Freight Services industry is expected to outperform the S&P broader market substantially this and next quarters, significantly in 2015, and marginally beyond, the two largest U.S. companies in the space are expected to split perform over the immediate term, with FedEx greatly outperforming the broader market while UPS swings from under- to out-. The two should then continue to outgrow the market in 2015 and beyond, with FedEx leading the way.After taking all company fundamentals into account, FedEx promises to deliver more given its lower stock price ratios, lower debt over market cap, higher current ratio, higher revenue over market cap, higher trailing revenue and earnings growth, higher EBITDA over market cap, higher 2015 earnings over current stock price, higher future earnings growth across the board, a better high price target, and the most strong buy analyst recommendations - handily winning the Air Delivery & Freight Services industry competition, plus an honorary Santa's Reindeer badge."

The holiday shopping season is the busiest time of the year for FedEx, so this appears to be a fine opportunity to examine the company using the DRAG framework. Its shares have gained nearly 30% during the past 12 months and now trade at 19 times forward earnings. This article will investigate FedEx's competitive position, balance sheet, dividend and earnings growth outlook to determine whether further capital appreciation potential exists for its shares.Please click here to read my article, which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which FedEx operates? 2) How strong is FedEx's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is FedEx's balance sheet? 4) What is FedEx's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower-quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.FedEx DRAG Analysis:FedEx shares posses a similar beta of the iShares Transportation Average ETF (BATS:IYT). Given that FedEx makes up more than 11% of this exchange traded fund, that fact might not seem particularly surprising. However, the lack of volatility and correlation to the broader stock market is interesting because one would expect that transportation companies would exhibit a fair amount of economic sensitivity. This academic research website demonstrates that transportation stocks tend to exhibit an average level of volatility, which seems more reasonable given the firm's elevated level of earnings volatility over the last decade. FedEx's net income declined by more than 90% in 2009 compared to the previous year, before completely rebounding a year later. Despite the beta of the stock and ETF during the last year, FedEx does not deserve an above-average score in this portion of the analysis due to its substantial historic earnings volatility.Unfortunately for FedEx, when compared with larger rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), its margins and efficiency ratios appear disappointing. While FedEx's operating ratio has improved slightly in recent years, it remains several percentage points behind UPS. Meanwhile, FedEx's return on invested capital over the last year is less than half of what UPS generated during this time. Simply put, the above data does not suggest that FedEx maintains any significant competitive advantages. While FedEx is one of the largest players in an industry that continues to expand as online shopping becomes more prevalent, based on the above returns, it merits only a score of 1 out of 3 for its competitive position.Going back more than a decade, FedEx has consistently possessed a conservative balance sheet. Currently, the firm has nearly $3 billion in cash on hand compared to just under $5 billion in long-term debt outstanding. Compared to its $48 billion market cap, this represents a negligible amount of leverage and offers FedEx's management plenty of financial flexibility. The firm's impressive interest coverage and current ratio also demonstrate its financial strength and confirm that investors should feel completely confident about the financial position of the company.Unfortunately for income investors, FedEx does not represent a logical alternative for their portfolios. The stock currently yields just half of one percent and although the company has raised its dividend annually for the last several years, the increases have not been significant enough to create a meaningful yield. One of the reasons for this is that free cash flow represented just 35% of the company's net income in its recently completed fiscal 2014. Therefore, while FedEx's payout ratio on earnings sits in single digits, its payout ratio based on free cash flow was over 25%. Last year, FedEx spent over $4 billion on share buybacks compared to just $187 million in dividends. Income-seeking investors must observe a significantly higher payout ratio (likely accompanied by reductions in capital expenditures) before FedEx becomes a possible addition to their portfolios.The above DRAG analysis demonstrates that using its 2016 projected earnings, FedEx's shares remain significantly undervalued. Trading at around $170 today, the framework suggests more than 35% upside potential exists over the next year. However, one major caveat applies here: because FedEx's fiscal 2014 ended in May of this year and the company is already halfway through its fiscal 2015, I am using an earnings estimate that looks 18 months into the future. Using the current year's earnings estimate of $8.99 per share leads to a $191 target price and capital appreciation potential of around 10%. Nevertheless, the conclusion of this analysis remains the same: based on its annual earnings growth potential of more than 15% and its pristine balance sheet, growth investors should view FedEx's stock as a compelling opportunity at its current price. In addition, investors who are patient enough to hold this stock for years to come will likely be rewarded with impressive returns."
2764645,74305,2014-12-18T01:22:23-05:00,"FDX announced its 2Q15 financial results with EPS $2.14, up 36% from the same quarter a year earlier although still falling short of the $2.19 forecast by 2.3%.The reported revenue and net profit were $11.9bn and $616 million, separately.The net impact from oil was partly delayed as the oil contract failed to match the market price quickly.","Financial SummaryFedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) reported its 2Q15 financial results with EPS $2.14, falling short of the $2.19 forecast by 2.3% but up 36% compared with the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue grew 4% to reach $11.9bn and net profit rose 23% to $616million but still slightly missed the estimate by 0.7%. The main drivers of profit were volume increase, net impact from fuel and lower pension expense. Given the consistent revenue growth, I remain positive over the profitability of the company although it missed the Street estimate in Q2.Key Factors UpdateIn terms of Express Segment, the revenue climbed 3% to reach $6.84bn given the higher package volume in both the US (up 7%) and international markets (up 5% and 1% for FedEx International Economy® and FedEx International Priority®, separately). However, the revenue per packaged witnessed a 2% decrease due to lower-than-expected benefit from fuel prices. According to the management team, the company buys fuels through contracts, which means the prices have been locked in a certain period and, hence, couldn't benefit that much from the cheaper fuel.For the Freight Segment, the company reported $1.59bn in revenue, up 11% from the same period a year earlier. LTL (Less-than-truckload) average daily shipment revenue increased 8%, or 3% growth per shipment due to higher weight per shipment and higher rates. Also, the company saw the LTL tonnage growth at public carriers has accelerated through October given its efficient cost control, which partly offset the resources shifting cost that induced by labor issue at West Coast ports.The Ground Segment, also, witnessed a strong revenue growth to reach $3.06bn, or 8% higher compared with the same period of last year, but the operating margin was slightly lower this quarter due to higher networking expansion cost. In conjunction with the Freight Segment, however, it is the investment that could help the company to build sustainable competitive advantage because of economies of scale. Further, FDX continues benefiting from the boom of e-commerce, as it plays an essential role for FDX to grow the shipment volume in this segment. By hiring 50K seasonal workers to guarantee the on time delivery, the company intends to make the best preparation for the year-end holiday season.In conclusion, I expect FDX will continue to deliver strong growth in FY15 given that 1) the fuel benefits will become higher after adjusting quickly to match the daily market rate, 2) the LTL remains robust and keeps growing at the high single digit rate and, finally, 3) e-commerce continues drive the volume growth of the Ground Segment. Although the company may not be able to enjoy the benefit from fuel prices in a long term, the networking expansion and increased delivery capacity will allow it to maintain upward momentum and to outperform its peers in the same industry."

FedEx has a market cap of $49 billion, about half as large as competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS) which has a market cap of $97 billion. FedEx has not reduced its dividend payments since initiating a dividend in 2002. The company was founded in 1971 by current CEO Fred Smith. Fred Smith allegedly bridged a budget shortfall in FedEx's start-up years with money he won playing blackjack. FedEx has made about $2.2 billion in profits over the last twelve months and no longer needs to fund its operations with a lucky gambling streak.Business OverviewFedEx operates in four business segments: Express, Ground, Freight, and Services. The Services segment primarily provides back office support to the other three segments and is excluded from the analysis below. Each segment's percent of total revenue, percent of total operating income, and operating margin for full fiscal 2014 is shown in the table below to give you an idea of the size and importance of each segment to FedEx's overall operations.Source: FedEx 2014 Annual ReportThe table above shows that FedEx's Ground segment generates the majority of the company's operating income despite making up just 26% of total revenue. The segment clearly has strong pricing power, while the Express and Freight segments appear to operate in commoditized markets. A brief overview of the operations of each segment is below.The Express segment is responsible for 61% of FedEx's revenue, and 34% of total operating income. The segment has an operating margin of just 4.3%. The segment offers both time-sensitive and delayed shipping services for both packages and freight within the US and internationally.The Ground segment has a day-certain delivery service, which delivers to nearly 100% of US consumers and businesses. The segment also has SmartPost operations, which consolidates high-volume, low-weight business to consumer packages and uses the USPS for final delivery. FedEx SmartPost made up less than 10% of the Ground segment's revenue in 2014. The day-certain ground delivery business is FedEx's primary profit driver.The Freight segment is FedEx's smallest on both a revenue and operating income basis. The segment offers priority freight services for time-sensitive shipments and economy services when time can be traded for savings.Competitive AdvantageFedEx's competitive advantage comes from its excellent domestic transportation network combined with its extensive global distribution network. The company has a fleet of 656 aircraft, including 4 Boeing 767s. FedEx also has about 3,100 Long-Haul tractors as well as about 45,000 other motorized vehicles with which to deliver packages. FedEx's massive fleet and significant infrastructure form a significant barrier to entry for new delivery businesses.In addition to the company's massive scale, FedEx has over 40 years of corporate knowledge built up in the distribution industry. The company's domestic ground segment consistently delivers packages faster than UPS. FedEx has built a reputation as the carrier of choice when time is of the essence. The image below shows FedEx's ground speed advantage over UPS. Source: FedEx Roadshow PresentationGrowth ProspectsFedEx's long-term goal is to grow EPS by between 10% and 15% per year. Over the past decade, FedEx fell far short of its long-term growth goals. The company has increased EPS by about 3.8% per year and revenue per share by 5.8% per year over the last decade. With that said, FedEx's future growth prospects do look bright.The company is benefiting from surging e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales are expected to grow by 10% a year in the US through 2018, and by about 14% per year internationally. FedEx stands to benefit from growing e-commerce sales as the company excels in domestic transportation. FedEx's market share of the domestic ground transportation industry continues to grow. The company has gained market share in ground for… 59 consecutive quarters. The image below shows growth in both the US ground transportation industry and FedEx's growing share of the US ground transportation industry: Source: FedEx Roadshow PresentationFedEx set record EPS in its full fiscal 2014 of $6.75. The company's previous EPS high was $6.67 back in 2007 (more on this in the Recession Performance section below). I believe FedEx's EPS will grow at a low double-digit pace until we see another recession. The company expects to boost EPS by over 6% in 2015 through share repurchases alone. The company will see organic growth from increased e-commerce activity in 2015. In addition, FedEx will likely gain market share in its profitable ground segment, which will boost the company's net profit margin due to a more favorable revenue mix.Recession PerformanceFedEx has a durable competitive advantage and strong growth prospects ahead due to rapid e-commerce growth. The company recently set an all-time EPS high of $6.75, but had reached EPS of $6.67 back in 2007. FedEx has grown EPS by about 2% over 7 years because it sees serious downturns during recessions. The overall economy has been slow to improve. This means less people buying packages, and less people shipping items to one another. Recessions negatively impact FedEx's operations. The company's EPS from 2007 through 2014 are shown below to give you an idea of how long it took the company to recover from the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.ValuationFedEx currently trades at a P/E ratio of about 23.3. The company is trading at a premium to the S&P 500's P/E ratio of about 19.7. This reflects FedEx's solid growth prospects ahead barring a recession. Over the last decade, FedEx has traded at a slight 1.05 premium to the S&P 500, on average. Based on its historical premium and the S&P 500's current P/E ratio of 19.7, FedEx should trade at a P/E ratio of about 20.7. As a result, I believe FedEx to be slightly overvalued at this time.Dividend Analysis & Final ThoughtsFedEx does not pass Rule One of The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing, which is to have 25 or more consecutive years of dividend payments without a reduction. Further, the company has a dividend yield of just 0.5%, well below the S&P 500's dividend yield of 1.9%. FedEx does have an extremely low payout ratio of about 6%, giving it substantial room for dividend increases going forward. Management has elected to return money to shareholders by repurchasing shares rather than significantly raising its dividend payments.Normally, share repurchases are beneficial, but FedEx appears to be slightly overvalued at this time. I believe management would be better served to increase its dividend payments substantially or to hold off on strong share repurchases until the next recession hits (whenever that may be) and FedEx's EPS fall, greatly reducing the price of the company's stock and making repurchases timely and accretive to shareholder value. I believe FedEx to be a hold for investors who see several more years of economic growth ahead for the US. The stock's low dividend yield and weakness in recessions combined with a high P/E ratio make it a poor choice for investors seeking current income."
2587695,39011,2014-10-23T08:57:32-04:00,"FDX has earnings estimates that are very achievable.
        Continued robust organic growth and low fuel prices could allow FDX to beat estimates.
        The valuation is reasonable right now given the company's prospects and I think we'll see $200 next year.","Shares of shipping behemoth FedEx (NYSE:FDX) have been soaring in recent quarters. The company's fantastic operating results have seen shares rise from $90 to $160 in just 18 months amid a vastly improving macro environment and prudent management by the company's executives. But with shares moving up so far in such a short amount of time, is the rally overdone or is there more left to this story? In this article I'll take a look at FDX to see if the company is still worth a look if you missed the rally.To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here. The model uses inputs such as earnings estimates, which I've pulled from Yahoo!, dividends, which I've set to grow at a flat 20 cents per year and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6.5%.You can see the model produced a fair value for FDX of $178, roughly $20 higher than the current share price. This would indicate that FDX is significantly undervalued at present but what exactly does the model tell us? The model is computing a fair value for the stock today and not a price target at some point in the future. It is saying the price at which investors can buy FDX today and achieve a margin of safety, given the inputs I described above, is $178. That's significant so let's dig a bit deeper to make sure we understand the bull case.The FedEx bull case begins, I think, with the simple fact that commerce is increasingly national and even global. Gone are the days when you have only the option to go somewhere local to buy something you need; you can order anything from anywhere in the world and FDX can get it to you in a matter of days. This works for businesses as well as consumers as ever-increasing shipping volumes have provided a huge tailwind to revenue irrespective of price increases; organic revenue growth is a base case for FDX as more and more goods are shipped in smaller quantities instead of the long haul trucking that used to dominate the shipping landscape. FedEx also benefits from high margin air shipments for critical packages or for those who simply can't wait for their products. The bottom line is that FedEx is in a very enviable position with its air and ground fleet infrastructures already robustly built out, incremental revenue is just that and high margin as it takes advantage of the significant scale the company has built. Adding incremental deliveries to a built out network has very little incremental cost and thus, margins rise over time.Oil prices have also tanked in recent months and that is nothing but good news for large consumers of fossil fuels. FedEx should see significantly decreased fuel costs going forward and that should inflate margins, setting the stage for earnings beats barring some unforeseen drop in volume. As one of its biggest expenses fuel costs being driven down are a big tailwind for earnings going forward.Analyst estimates look high in the mid-teens and while that kind of earnings growth is tough to achieve for a company the size of FDX, this is a company that has shown a propensity to grow earnings that quickly for long stretches of time. In fact, 15% is right in line with the company's long term earnings growth trend and with the tailwinds we just discussed, I don't see any reason that can't continue. If anything, with prices for fossil fuels bouncing along the bottom I think there is some upside to even those lofty goals. At the very least I find mid-teens growth to be very achievable and while that kind of number would scare me aware from most stocks, FDX is unique.Overall I love FedEx here as a play on the continued rise in e-commerce and low fuel prices. The company grows by leaps and bounds on its own but structural tailwinds that are as powerful as organic growth and low fuel costs will put FedEx into the next echelon of growth. I think shares will move to $200 next year on further improved sentiment, still higher volumes and low fuel costs. The dividend isn't much to speak of but every little bit helps as well and maybe, just maybe, FDX will be a dividend stock at some point too."
2586655,69675,2014-10-23T03:21:40-04:00,"For the quarter, analysts expect United Parcel to report a nice uptick in sales and profits.
        In recent years, the business has had a pretty nice run on the profit front, while sales growth has lagged rival FedEx.
        Moving forward, both companies have something to offer shareholders, with one providing historically stronger sales growth and the other championing stronger margins.","Before the market opens on Oct. 24, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is expected to report revenue and earnings for the third quarter of its 2014 fiscal year. With shares of the world's largest logistics/goods transportation business trading in the middle of its 52-week range, it seems Mr. Market doesn't quite know what to expect moving forward, but is it likely that it's being unjustifiably discounted by Mr. Market?Analysts expect nice growthFor the quarter, analysts expect United Parcel to report revenue of $14.20 billion. If this forecast turns out to be accurate, it will represent a 5% increase in sales over the $13.52 billion management reported the same quarter last year. In the event that this estimate is correct, the largest nominal increase will likely come from the business's U.S. Domestic Package segment, while its fastest-growing area of operations will likely be its International Package segment.Looking at profits, the outlook is even better. If analysts are correct in their assumptions, United Parcel will report earnings per share of $1.29, up 11% from the $1.16 management reported during the third quarter of the company's 2013 fiscal year. On top of benefiting from growing sales, United Parcel's bottom line will likely tick up due to a reduction in share count year-over-year, combined, to some extent, with lower operating costs.Who makes for a better long-term play though?With forecasts for United Parcel looking generally positive, some investors may be tempted to jump in and call it a day. This might, however, be a costly mistake. In order to see whether United Parcel's an attractive prospect, investors need to compare it to a rival such as FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which could be a better play for a certain type of investor, over an extended period of time.Take, for instance, the past five years. Between 2009 and 2013, United Parcel saw its revenue rise 22% from $45.30 billion to $55.44 billion as its U.S. Domestic Package segment saw sales climb 21% from $28.16 billion to $34.07 billion. As attractive as this was, however, the company's smaller International Package segment grew even faster, with sales rising 28% from $9.70 billion to $12.43 billion.UPS Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsWhile this growth was pretty nice to see, FedEx performed even better. Between 2009 and 2013 (its 2010-2014 fiscal years, which are the most comparable to United Parcel), the smaller rival saw its top line climb 31% from $34.73 billion to $45.57 billion. According to its most recent annual report, the largest nominal contributor to this growth spurt was the company's FedEx Express segment, which grew sales by 26% from $21.56 billion to $27.12 billion. Its fastest-growing area of operations, however, was its FedEx Ground segment, which saw revenue shoot up 56% from $7.44 billion to $11.62 billion.From a revenue standpoint, it's easy to call FedEx the winner, but what about on the earnings front? Over the same five-year period, United Parcel saw its net income skyrocket 122% from $1.97 billion to $4.37 billion. On top of benefiting from an increase in sales, the company's bottom line grew as a result of a decrease in its compensation and benefits expense, which, during this period, fell significantly from 57.3% of sales to 51.5%.UPS Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsFedEx also fared well during this period, but was unable to keep up with its big cousin. Over a similar timeframe, the company's net income shot up 77% from $1.19 billion to $2.10 billion. Like United Parcel, FedEx enjoyed some bottom line improvement stemming from its growth in sales but its costs didn't fall in relation to sales as quickly as United Parcel's had. During this period, the company's selling, general and administrative expenses declined from 47.2% of sales to 42.1%.TakeawayBased on the data provided, Mr. Market seems to be unsure of what to make of United Parcel, in spite of both it and FedEx indicating that this year's traffic of goods will likely be very high. This, combined with the performance of both companies in recent years suggests that there's a nice amount of potential going forward. To address this, investors who are interested in sales growth will likely find FedEx a nice play, while United Parcel is more likely to appeal to investors seeking slower growth but higher margins. No matter how you stack it though, either business looks set to provide opportunities for market participants down the road."
2522615,71985,2014-09-26T06:41:28-04:00,FedEx posted strong 1QFY15 earnings results that were supported by the better-than-expected top line and operating income growth and a large number of share buybacks.The company currently has a ROIC that is smaller than WACC but the FedEx’s management is constantly trying to improve its returns.The company’s future prospects are bright thanks to the global economies’ expected improvement in CY15.FedEx has a much better infrastructure than its close rival UPS.The company’s stock is trading at a discount based on price multiples.,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) reported strong first quarter FY15 results with per share earnings of $2.10 overshooting the consensus estimates of $1.96 per share. The areas of surprises are the better-than-expected top-line; the considerably higher operating income growth; and a large number of share buybacks. The better-than-expected results put FedEx on track to achieve its full year earnings target of between $8.50 and $9 per share.FedEx's revenues climbed 5.99% to $11.684 billion compared to the analysts' expectations of $11.47 billion. The revenues jumped in all three of the company's segments: Express, Ground and Freight.In FedEx Express, the revenues were driven by volume and yield growth in both the U.S. and international export package businesses and partially offset by lower freight revenue. The segment's revenues increased 4%. At FedEx Ground, the revenues jumped 8% driven by higher volume from continued growth in the FedEx Home Delivery service and commercial business. The increase in rates also favorably impacted the segment's revenues. FedEx Freight's revenues increased 13% mainly due to higher average daily LTL shipments and revenue per LTL shipment.Source: 10QAs a result of the restructuring program which started in 2012, the company has been able to reduce its costs and expenses leading to a significant YoY increase in the operating income. The expenses in the Express segment were cut more quickly than projected in this quarter. The company has reduced its workforce and is overhauling its air fleet buying new planes to better meet the demand and to achieve higher fuel efficiency.These cost-cutting initiatives resulted in a considerable improvement of FedEx's operating, EBIT and net income margins. The improved margins along with the better-than-expected revenue growth led to 23.93% YoY growth in the company's net profits. The net profits of this quarter were $606 million. The company's restructuring strategy is expected to improve profit by $1.6 billion by the end of 2016.Source: 10QShare BuybacksFedEx's per share earnings in this quarter rose 37.25% to $2.1 per share compared to $1.53 per share in the first quarter of FY14. However, the company's net earnings experienced YoY growth of only 23.93% reflecting the fact that a share repurchase program has boosted per share earnings.In its FY14, FedEx authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 32 million shares of common stock. During the first quarter of FY15 the company repurchased 5.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $148 per share for a total of $791 million. The program was completed at the end of the first quarter of FY15 and had a YoY positive impact of 15 cents on earnings per share.WACC greater than ROICThe considerable growth in FedEx's net earnings is anticipated to improve the returns in its invested capital. But currently the company is actually getting fewer returns on its investment as its weighted average cost of capital ""WACC"" is higher than its ROIC. This reflects the fact that for every dollar of investment the company is paying out more than it earns thus making its stock less attractive for shareholders.Therefore, the company's management needs to improve its ROIC ideally by selling its non-performing assets or the management should finance its assets from other sources which require lower cost.One of the company's long-term goals is to increase its ROIC, so we can expect that in the coming quarters the company will be earning better returns and that the earnings growth will start adding positive value.Source: RoadshowOutlookFedEx's future prospects are bright as the global economy is expected to improve in CY15. The global GDP forecast for CY15 is 3.1% compared to 2.6% in CY14 due to emerging nations, especially the Asia-Pacific markets, experiencing considerably higher-than-average growth. The GDP forecast in the company's domestic market of the U.S. is 3.2% for CY15 compared to 2.1% in CY14. The U.S. consumer spending growth is projected to be 2.6% in CY15 compared to 2.3% in CY14.The pace of improvement in the economy would provide a favorable operating scenario for FedEx as the trade growth is greater than the GDP growth. The moderate global growth would drive volume and yield improvements for FedEx.Source: RoadshowThe rising worldwide trend of online sales will also improve FedEx's revenue growth. In the U.S. online sales are outpacing retail sales at a YoY growth rate of over 3:1.The other favorable factors for the company are the ongoing improvements in all of its transportation segments and the lower than expected fuel cost in the coming years due to falling oil prices. FedEx has a much better infrastructure than its close rival UPS. FedEx has 29.8% lanes faster than UPS and only 3% of UPS' lanes are faster than FedEx. So FedEx has a net advantage of 26.8% giving the company an opportunity to grab a larger market share than its rival.Source: RoadshowValuationBased on Comparable Valuation technique, the stock's fair value is $167.53 depicting an upside potential of 5.41%.Source: money.msnThe company's forward P/E of 14.85 is also lower than its current P/E of 23.47 indicating that its earnings will grow in the coming quarters.Final ThoughtsFedEx's performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 was indeed impressive. And it is expected that the company will continue performing like this in the coming quarters due to the favorable market outlook, its strong infrastructure, its effective restructuring strategies and falling fuel costs. These factors would result in expansion of its margins and an improvement in its return on invested capital.The only problem with the company is the fact that its WACC is higher than its current ROIC but I do not think that this makes it a poor investment as the company is constantly trying to improve its returns. Besides this point, the company's price multiples also suggest growth potential. Therefore I would recommend investing in the stock."
2518065,72015,2014-09-24T13:00:52-04:00,"This article compares two heavyweights in the global transportation and logistics sector: FedEx and United Parcel Service.FedEx offers better expected levels of future earnings growth than UPS and trades at a discounted valuation.UPS has more impressive efficiency ratios and pays a much more enticing dividend than FedEx.However, investors should focus on FedEx as the preferred option in this industry due to its excellent growth outlook.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) are a pair of high quality global transportation and logistics companies based in the United States. Investors looking to capitalize on a global economic recovery should look into both of these stocks. This article will compare FedEx and UPS on twenty different valuation, efficiency, growth and dividend metrics in an attempt to determine which one you should consider adding to your investment portfolio.Over the last 12 months, FedEx has outperformed UPS by nearly 30%. Much of this has been caused by the most recent two quarters of results: FedEx beat consensus earnings estimates in both, while UPS fell short of expectations both times. FedEx's earnings outlook for the coming 12 months is also quite impressive, helping lift the stock to all time highs:Valuation:Growth:Efficiency/Capital Structure:Dividend:Despite their obvious similarities as two global leaders in the transportation sector, FedEx and UPS are thoroughly different companies. UPS is more of an income investment with a highly levered balance sheet and impressive efficiency ratios, while FedEx has the edge in future earnings growth potential and trades at slightly lower valuations across the board.While choosing between these impressive companies is difficult, I would argue that FedEx represents the stronger investment choice at this point in time. Its PEG (price to growth) ratio of 1.2 is inspiring and the firm's conservative balance sheet gives it the ability to make strategic acquisitions or raise its dividend significantly in the future. I contend that dividends are less important in cyclical industries than defensive ones and therefore UPS' above average dividend yield is not meaningful enough to tip the balance in its favor. One usually looks to invest in a transportation stock such as UPS or FedEx to benefit from global economic growth; FedEx appears poised to successfully achieve this growth moving forward and given its discounted valuation relative to UPS, it is the company that I would suggest currently represents the better investment."
2522395,54082,2014-09-26T02:42:19-04:00,"FedEx had an exceptional quarter with its revenue and profits growing.E-commerce should be a major driver for the company going forward.All its segments are performing equally well, so growth is on the cards.","Same time three years ago, investors were losing their confidence in FedEx (NYSE: FDX), as the company's performance had stagnated. Its stock prices then, were at the same level as they were half a decade back in 2005. However, the company started making changes to revive its performance and subsequently its stock prices increased by more than double in the last three years.FedEx with its first-quarter earnings for fiscal 2015 has delivered better-than-expected numbers. The package delivery giant reported its first-quarter revenue of $11.7 billion, up 6% from $11.0 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter was reported at $606 million, up by 24% from $489 million last year. FedEx has edged out analysts' estimates of $11.4 billion on revenue and of $1.95 per share on earnings.Firing All GunsFedEx, in its last reported quarter, posted an increase in both sales and operating margins in all its three segments -- Express, Ground, and Freight. The company's Freight segment reported a notable growth with its revenue surging by 13% and income by 7%, as its average daily shipments in its ""LTL,"" or ""less-than-truckload"" category, grew remarkably. FedEx's largest division, its Express segment, which contributes about two-fifth of the company's total revenue, grew moderately by 4% both in terms of revenue and earnings.Further, the Ground segment has become an integral part of the company and has grown more than 56% in the last 4 years. The Ground Segment accounts for half of the Express Segment's revenue but, it generates a very high operating margin. In the last reported quarter, the Ground Segment's revenue grew 8%, with its operating margins increasing to 18.4%. Due to overall network expansion costs, the rise in Ground Segment's operating margin was somewhat neutralized, however the same will help in increasing revenue in the future.The PositiveE-commerce is no doubt the fastest growing retail segment, as consumers are getting attracted to the expediency and low prices offered by online retailers. According to a survey by Forrester Research, e-commerce is estimated to grow from $263 billion in 2013 to $414 billion in 2018 in the U.S. alone, which interestingly represents just 11% of the total U.S. retail sales, leaving a lot of growth opportunities going forward.As the packages need to be delivered to the customers, FedEx's Ground segment has tremendous potential to grow. Previously, the growth of online retail has helped FedEx's Ground Segment revenue to surge from $7.4 billion in its 2010 fiscal year to $11.6 billion in fiscal year 2014. The segment is growing with 12% compound annual growth rate and being the company's most profitable segment, its growth will help in increasing FedEx's bottom-line as e-commerce booms further.Going forward, another important factor that can boost FedEx's top line and bottom line is the improvement in the overall global economy. As FedEx is a bellwether company, in the past decade it was mainly impacted by the Great Recession and the slow pace of subsequent recovery. FedEx's management has accepted that more than anything else, it was their slow reaction to change that had made things worse for them. However, as the global economy strengthens, the company will benefit from rising volumes, better service, and improved pricing power.The real driver for the growth in FedEx's profit will be its own cost-cutting initiatives. Between May 2013 and May 2014, the company has reduced its staff, principally through an early retirement program. In 2012 and 2013, the company had made another important tactical decision to reduce the size of its jet fleet that is used in its Express operations.The company is retiring a score of its old aircrafts as they guzzle fuel. The company's jet fleet will reduce by 13 aircrafts in the next two years. Further, many of these planes will not be replaced and those being changed will be replaced by smaller jets that will lower trip costs. The strategy will compliment the change in the market scenario, where customers are choosing the economical ""deferred"" delivery options compared to ""Express"" delivery. Further, for any additional delivery requirements, it is more cost-effective for FedEx to contract out those shipments to other airlines than to maintain its own fleet of jets for delivering cargo, as their operating overheads is higher than carriage charges.The Risk Still RemainsE-commerce is growing and with that transport companies will have a lot of packages to move from warehouses of online retailers to customers. FedEx has a major client, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which accounts for a significant proportion of ground shipments that FedEx ships. However, due to its huge size, Amazon has the power to negotiate deals with delivery companies. Recently, FedEx lost a lot of business to competitors as they offered better deals.Further, in the longer term, Amazon is planning to develop its own in-house package delivery service. At the moment, FedEx and other transport companies remain Amazon's most sensible choice, but eventually as the company develops its own delivery system, factoring the growth in the e-commerce business, it might become a major threat to other transport companies.In August, the Postal Regulatory Commission -- which regulates the Post Office, has given the USPS permission to reduce prices for customers shipping more than 50,000 packages annually. Due to this, the price of Priority Mail has been reduced by up to 58%, starting Sept. 7.Both FedEx and UPS have complained against the new regulation by saying that the USPS is employing its monopoly position as a letter carrier to compete unduly in the package delivery business. However, in reality, being a regulated institution, the USPS was not allowed to give volume discounts in the same way as FedEx and UPS. From now on, with lower prices, the USPS is in a better position to compete with FedEx and UPS, as its Priority Mail product might become a viable alternative for online vendors.TakeawayFedEx is in a solid position to grow its earnings by investing more on improving its efficiencies and implementing its cost-saving initiatives. As the economy is in a resurgence state, it should help as well. Investors should not be worried about FedEx's performance, but the only concern that remains is whether it is worth buying at its current price. After a solid run for over three years now, I doubt there is much upside to this stock."
2519055,70915,2014-09-24T18:37:22-04:00,FedEx’s latest quarter brought an improvement of 6% in the top line. Earnings improved by 37%.The booming e-commerce market is likely to result in higher shipment volume for FedEx’s Ground segment in the future.The increase in rates and a new charging structure should also boost the earnings.,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is now recovering from the mishaps it has faced this year. In July, the company was indicted for gaining nearly $820 million from shipping packages of illegal online pharmacies. This has had a negative impact on the share value. However, last week, the stock price went up by more than 3% and touched a 52-week high after the company announced the first quarterly result of fiscal year 2015.In this article, I will go through the company's latest quarterly performance to evaluate its financial strength. After that I will discuss factors which should justify the quantified upside of the company.First QuarterFedEx's revenue rose by 6% to $11.7 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. All the segments of the company contributed positively towards the increase. Express segment's volume grew by 4%, as a result of the higher demand for the company's economical services. Ground segment's volume benefited from the e-commerce boom.In addition to higher volumes, a greater fuel surcharge drove up the revenue per package, leading to yield improvement of 130 bps. Moreover, the operating margin grew due to FedEx's profitability improvement program, which eventually boosted the net profit by 24%.The company delivered earnings growth of 37% per diluted share as the figure came to $2.10. The increase was a combined result of greater revenue and buyback of 5.3 million shares, which added an additional 15 cents per share to earnings.There are several factors prevailing currently that should continue driving the earnings trend for FedEx. First, the e-commerce boom is likely to persist and even enhance in the future. The North American e-commerce industry is forecasted to grow at a rate of 33% this year and 31.7% in 2015.In the preceding two quarters of 2014, the U.S. retail e-commerce sales grew by 15.5% and 15.7% respectively. As a result, FedEx was able to increase its Ground service's average daily volume by 6.1%. Higher forecasted e-commerce activity in the near future should allow FedEx to further boost its shipment volume.Source: JLLMoreover, the boom in e-commerce activity is not just limited to the U.S., but will be seen in other developed economies as well. The U.S. is only a part of the global trend of increasing online sales, which are being driven by a greater number of people using their smartphones to make online purchases. This usage is expected to grow further as the number of mobile shoppers is forecast to rise to 175 million by 2016 (see graph above).Furthermore, developing economies are expected to pace up with the developed ones in terms of their e-commerce ecosystem. Due to that, the global e-commerce landscape will change rapidly over the next 5-10 years. In particular, although the U.S. will remain the biggest B2C e-commerce economy in 2017, China should move into the second place, hence facilitating trade.These macro trends hold an important revenue-growth opportunity for FedEx. They won't only help the company in growing its Ground business, but the company can also gain through the distribution network established under its Express segment.In addition to the macro factors, the company's own efforts are also in line to deliver a higher earnings figure. Prior to the announcement of the latest quarterly result, the company said that it will be increasing the rates of all its services by 4.9% on average, which will come into effect from January of 2015. Not only this, FedEx also updated its charging structure by introducing dimension-based pricing for all ground shipments.Dimension-based pricing, in comparison to weight-based pricing, allows a company to acquire better price realization for bulky yet light-weight packages. Dimensional pricing for all ground packages will also be in effect from January. Since Ground segment is the largest segment of FedEx, the increase in rates and the charging structure should help drive revenue and margins higher for the company.Bottom LineThe efforts currently being run should allow FedEx to gain back its competitive advantage that it has been losing recently to rivals such as United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Because of better future prospects, the company has reaffirmed its guidance of $8.5-$9 in earnings per share for the current year, implying a growth rate of 26%-34% from the fiscal year 2014.I have valued the company by using the company's and industry's fundamentals. Based upon the above table, FedEx provides an upside of 36% at the current market price. The booming e-commerce market and rate hike support this potential. Therefore, the company holds a buy rating."

FedEx will benefit from the surging e-commerce activities. In the recent quarter, the company beat EPS expectations by a big margin. In addition, FedEx plans to increase its shipping rates by about five percent. FedEx has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 7.56, and its average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years are very high at 15.2%. Furthermore, FedEx has shown a significant improvement in its profitability in the trailing twelve months.The CompanyFedEx Corporation is a leading international provider of package delivery, e-commerce and related services. The company's four reporting segments are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Office. FedEx was founded in 1971 and is based in Memphis, Tennessee.Source: Roadshow PresentationValuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of FDX. The data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.FDX's valuation metrics are good; the PEG ratio is low at 1.18, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 7.56, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is very high at 15.18%.Latest Quarter ResultsOn September 17, FedEx reported its first-quarter fiscal 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.14 (7.10%) and beat estimates on revenues.The company reported earnings of $2.10 per diluted share for the first quarter ended August 31, up 37% from last year's $1.53 per share.First-Quarter HighlightsFedEx Corp. reported the following consolidated results for the first quarter:• Revenue of $11.7 billion, up 6% from $11.0 billion the previous year• Operating income of $987 million, up 24% from $795 million last year• Operating margin of 8.5%, up from 7.2% the previous year• Net income of $606 million, up 24% from last year's $489 millionIn the report, Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseFedEx has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 2002. The forward annual dividend yield is pretty low at 0.51% and the payout ratio is only 8.8%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years has been 7.7%, over the past five years has been 6.4%, and over the past ten years has been 7.5%.FDX Dividend data by YChartsSince the dividend yield of 0.51% is not very attractive, and the payout ratio is extremely low, there is a good chance that the company will raise its dividend payment by a higher rate.During the quarter, the company acquired 5.3 million shares of FedEx common stock. As of August 31, 2014, no shares remained under the existing share repurchase authorizations.Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between FedEx and its competitors is shown in the table below.FedEx has the lowest PEG ratio, the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio among the stocks in the group, and the strongest earnings growth prospects.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comFDX stock price is 4.27% above its 20-day simple moving average, 5.19% above its 50-day simple moving average, and 12.05% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term, mid-term and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.26 and ascending, which is a bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 69.04, near overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the stock, but their opinion is divided. Among the twenty-eight analysts, nine rate it as a Strong Buy, three rate it as a Buy, and sixteen analysts rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering FDX stock there are eleven analysts who have the four or five star rating; seven of them recommend the stock and four analyst rate it as a Hold.Source: TipRanksIs FedEx's performance improving?In order to give an answer to this question, I decided to compare FedEx's latest trailing 12 months' values of six relevant parameters to their previous trailing 12 months' values and to the five years' average values. The results are shown in the table below; the data were taken from Portfolio123.All trailing 12 month values of the Margins parameters and the Return on Capital parameters were above the previous 12 month values, and above the five years' average.In my opinion, these results demonstrate significant improvement in the profitability of the company.Major DevelopmentsOn September 16, the company announced that FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, subsidiaries of FedEx Corp., will increase shipping rates effective January 5, 2015. FedEx Express will increase shipping rates by an average of 4.9% for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services. FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery will increase shipping rates by an average of 4.9%. FedEx SmartPost rates will also change. FedEx Freight will increase shipping rates by an average of 4.9%.According to Bloomberg, FedEx is adding at least 50,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday season as a measure of precaution ahead of an anticipated jump in year-end e-commerce growth. Retail e-commerce spending may rise almost 17 percent this holiday season, the fastest growth since 2011, to $72.4 billion, according to New York-based market research firm EMarketer estimates. Holiday e-commerce sales now account for 8.4 percent of all holiday retail sales, according to EMarketer, the highest percentage since they began collecting data in 2008.FDX's stock has been doing well in recent years. Since the start of the year FDX's stock has gained 10.1%, while the S&P 500 index has risen 8.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has increased 9.7%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2013, FDX's stock has gained 72.6%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 41.0%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 51.7%. Nevertheless, considering its good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, FDX's stock, in my opinion, still has plenty of room to move up.My TakeI see strong revenue and earnings growth prospects for the company. FedEx will benefit from the surging e-commerce activities. The company said that growth in online shopping is expected to contribute to another record holiday season. Also, the fact that FedEx plans to hire more than 50,000 extra workers to handle the added package deliveries, significantly more than about 40,000 temporary holiday workers hired last year, demonstrates the strong growth that the company anticipates. In addition, FedEx's decision to increase shipping rates by about five percent in a period of very low inflation shows that company is confident that the high demand for its services will continue.ConclusionFedEx will benefit from the surging e-commerce activities. FedEx has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 7.56, and its average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is very high at 15.2%. Furthermore, FedEx has shown a significant improvement in its profitability in the trailing twelve months. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that FDX's stock is a smart long-term investment."

Beating the analysts' estimates, the company's stock price rose 3.4% after the company reported its earnings. The price of the stock has risen 13.7% since the start of the year (see chart below).Source: YChartsDuring the recently-ended quarter, the company's top line beat the Wall Street analysts' estimate by $0.22 billion. The company reported revenues of $11.70 billion, compared to analysts' expectations of $11.48 billion. The bottom line of the company escalated 24% YoY to $606 billion, or $2.1 per share, while analysts had their expectations set at $1.96 per share. The credit for the positive surprise this quarter goes to the restructuring of its Air Express division, which started to pay off sooner than the management had expected. The company began the restructuring of the division back in 2012, and reduced the overall costs in the division mostly by slashing the employee count. The company's management reported, ""About 3,600 employees have accepted buyout offers and left the company"".In addition to reducing the employee count, the company is enacting other measures to reduce costs to favourably impact the bottom line. FedEx is replacing its air fleet with fuel-efficient planes in order to counter the rising fuel prices and ensure more efficient management of its deliveries. The restructuring efforts are expected to unlock upside profit potential of as much as $1.6 billion by the end of FY2016.As per the recent earnings release, all of the company's segments performed better when compared to the figures reported last year. The following table indicates the percentage change in revenue generation (left) and operating income (right) of each segment in comparison with their corresponding quarters in 2013. Source: First-Quarter Earnings ReleaseFinancial PerformanceThe company's fundamentals reveal that FedEx beat the industry averages for gross, operating, and net profit margins. The company's gross margin was 62.49%, compared to the industry's average of 9.92%, while its operating profit margin was 7.87%, compared to the industry standard of 3.37%. The higher gross and operating profit margins are a clear indication that the company is more efficient in managing its overall costs compared to other players in the market. The company's net profit margin was 4.79%, compared to the industry standard of 2.21%.FedEx maintains a higher liquidity position when compared to its peers, which is evident from its current ratio of 1.80 and acid test ratio of 1.70, compared to the industry's current ratio of 1.33 and acid test ratio of 1.22, which indicates that the company is better able to deal with its day-to-day expenses from its continuing operation than its counterparts.In spite of higher profit margins and higher liquidity position, the company's debt-to-equity ratio denotes that its balance sheet is weaker than other industry participants. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 31.31, while the industry standard is 25.73. However, FedEx's interest coverage ratio exceeds the industry norm manifold at 41.85, compared to the industry average of 2.04. This denotes the fact that the company's ability to pay off the debt on its balance sheet is better than that of its peers.Future and Industry OutlookThe company had to face challenges during the holiday season last year. The backlog of orders piled up and the company failed to deliver packages on time, which caused a blow to its reputation and boosted its costs. In retrospect, the company has been enacting measures to avoid repeating this disaster; the replacement of the air fleet with newer and more fuel-efficient planes is a testament to that. Moreover, the company is contemplating hiring more temporary employees this year compared to last year. It plans to hire about 50,000 extra temporary holiday workers this season, compared to 40,000 workers last year, in order to handle the added pressure of delivering packages on time during the holiday season.The company's overall operating costs are expected to increase this season as it adjusts its headcount and transportation needs to better meet demands. It is no surprise that the holiday season is the busiest season of the year for all delivery companies. The shipment volume peaks about seven to twelve days before Christmas for FedEx in particular, and that volume has been increasing over the past five years (see graph below).Source: BloombergAs per the latest estimate, retail ecommerce is expected to grow 17% to $72.4 billion this year. Online sales have been rapidly growing in recent years, and now account for 8.4% of total holiday retail sales, as per the latest data. The percentage of online sales recorded this year is higher than ever before. The following graph compares online sales growth with retail sales growth through history.Source: Company PresentationNow that the online channel of sales has established its importance, it has created challenges for shipping companies to deal with orders effectively. The ability to purchase online gives customers the advantage to make last-minute purchases, thus creating further hurdles for parcel companies, since transits are not that easy to tailor according to immediate changes.However, FedEx is better prepared to tackle issues this year in comparison to last year. It is expected that the company will increase prices for last-minute buyers this season in order to curtail such behavior to some extent.Concluding RemarksThe company's fundamentals depict a stronger position compared to its counterparts. The company's top and bottom lines are expected to yield better results in the future as the company updates its air fleet and takes steps to slash its costs. FedEx's management has thrice made an upward revision in its expected full-year earnings up until now, which again points to better profit margins this year.The company returns value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Presently, its dividend yield hovers around 0.50%, compared to the industry average of 1.55%, but the yield might improve in the upcoming future once the necessary overhauling is completed."

The company was founded back in 1971 and is based in Memphis, Tennessee.FedEx's famed CEO and Founder Fred Smith was the son of a wealthy entrepreneur who died when Fred was only four years old. Smith was raised by his mother and uncles, becoming an amateur pilot as a teen, and graduating from Yale University with a degree in Economics. It was while he was at Yale he wrote a paper outlining the idea for an overnight delivery service in the computer information age. This paper only earned him a grade of ""C,"" but it became the blueprint for the company called Federal Express. After graduating from Yale, he served in the Marine Corps and received the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts. He used his $4 million inheritance to start the company Federal Express.FedEx continues to be a major competitive force in the industry, benefiting from the rise of e-commerce and the increasing demand for expedited shipping solutions. The company just reported a blowout quarter on September 17, beating analyst estimates by $0.15 and also exceeding revenue estimates. The upside to estimates was driven by strong volume growth in its FedEx Ground segment, which delivers online purchases, but the company executed well across all three segments: business, ground, and freight. FedEx's shipping rates will be increasing effective January 5, 2015 by an average of 4.9% for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services.So after a few rocky quarters, FedEx's business appears to be back on track and poised for the holiday season.

Most people have a definition of what they consider value, but in the stock market valuation is a metric based on earnings growth, company fundamentals, and price. These variables are critically important, but interestingly, sometimes ignored, or sometimes forgotten, so let's tackle this in a reverse context.Are you looking for a stock that is trading at 5x its earnings growth rate, a stock that has been growing at a slower pace consistently for the past few quarters, a stock that is expected to continue to grow at a subdued pace, but one whose stock price has increased aggressively?Of course, most people do not search for companies with these attributes. In fact, one might argue that when investors look for companies they look for companies with the exact opposite qualities. Investors prefer to find stocks that trade at relatively low valuations compared to earnings growth, stocks that have not already run aggressively, and stocks that actually have improving earnings growth. That is, if your definition of an investor is one that looks for long-term value.There are other definitions of course, some people consider an investor someone who buys the market every month like clockwork, but the market is comprised of all stocks, some of which have good valuations, and some that don't.If you are looking for a company who has had deteriorating earnings growth, who is expected to continue to grow at a subdued pace, who is trading at five times its earnings growth rate, but a stock that has also increased aggressively, look no further than Federal Express (NYSE:FDX).Federal Express is a poster child for an overvalued company. A simple review of the valuation metrics shown in the graphs below demonstrate the points made above. Because Federal Express is a company that so many investors know of any use, they may be tempted to incorporate the Random Walk theory to influence their decision to invest. For example, if you use the service and like it, Random walk theory suggests that you might want to invest in it, but more work needs to be done before decisions are made.Right now it seems that investors in FedEx are hoping that the company does better, but the projections from the company suggest that growth rates are not going to warrant PE multiples for years.With those fundamental observations in Tow, what do the technicals say? According to our real time trading report for FDX the stock is at longer term resistance right now. That adds another element to that question above. If you are looking for a stock that is overvalued and a stock that is at long term resistance too, you have found it in FedEx.FDX Valuation Graphs:"

The company said that rates of FedEx Express will be increased by an average 4.9% for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services. Rates of FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery will also rise by an average 4.9%. Rates will be increased at FedEx Freight also by the same percentage.FedEx reported earnings of $2.10 per diluted share for the first quarter ended August 31, up 37% from $1.53 per share of the previous year. The company reported revenue of $11.7 billion, up 6% from $11 billion of the previous year. Faced with increasing competition, FedEx initiated a new pricing policy called ""dimensional weight"" in May based on parcel size, instead of weight alone, to reduce the cost of ground delivery. We believe the new pricing policy boosted the company's bottom line in the most recent quarter. FedEx said the change to ""dimensional weight"" pricing was likely to help revenue and operating income in its ground segment.In our original article, we said that the company has lots of weapons in its arsenal to counter rising fuel price, and we had a price target of $175 for the stock. However, forthcoming shipping rate hike coupled with an impressive financial result makes us feel more bullish on the stock than before.

2502005,69675,2014-09-17T12:53:35-04:00,"For the quarter, FedEx reported revenue and earnings that handily outperformed analyst forecasts, as well as last year's results, leaving shares to jump around 4%.This confirms my opinion that the business could make a great prospect for sales growth, but suggests it may be better than UPS from a profit standpoint as well.In my prior work on the business, I did not forecast a beat, but I did suggest that the business's long-term growth rate could be meaningful down the road.","Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) rose around 4% on Sept. 17 after news broke that the logistics company reported revenue and earnings that topped analyst expectations. For the quarter, sales came in at $11.68 billion. This represents a 6% jump in revenue compared to the $11.02 billion management reported during the first quarter of 2014 and was higher than the $11.48 billion analysts hoped to see. According to the company's press release, this increase in revenue was driven largely by its FedEx Express segment, which saw revenue climb 4% from $6.61 billion to $6.86 billion, though its FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments grew faster, at a rate of 8% and 13%, respectively.Earnings OverviewWhile sales did quite well during this period, profits came in even stronger. For the quarter, FedEx's earnings per share hit $2.10. This is 37% higher than last year's profits of $1.53 per share and handily outpaced the $1.96 in earnings Mr. Market was anticipating. To some extent, this growth in revenue was driven by higher sales, but management also attributed a great deal of this increase to the business' salaries and employee benefits expenses, which declined from 37% of sales to 35.9% and its fuel expenses, which dropped from 10% of sales to 9.6%.In a previous article, I highlighted that FedEx's long-term performance suggests that the business makes for a strong prospect for those looking for sales growth, while rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) might be preferred for investors seeking margin improvement. FedEx certainly proved during this quarter that the sales growth part of my thesis is correct, but it also implies that the company may be entering a cycle where margins could improve significantly as well. In this past quarter, its net profit margin hit 5.2%, up from the 4.4% seen in last year's quarter, which seems to indicate that the business might accomplish both strong sales growth and margin improvement in the years to come."
2501765,25120,2014-09-17T11:33:47-04:00,"FedEx beats on estimates driven by revenue growth, cost control and share repurchases.The company remains upbeat about the future, announcing an sizable rate hike effective at the start of next year.Being comfortably on track with its 2016 earnings targets, investors are cheering.","Investors in FedEx (NYSE:FDX) were very pleased with the company's strong first quarter results providing comfort as the company is well on track to achieve its 10% operating margin target for 2016.The great earnings visibility provides comfort to shares which have already risen by 50% over the past year, pleasing investors. That being said, the current risk-reward scenario is not that appealing in my eyes, considering the big run up already.First Quarter HighlightsFedEx posted first quarter sales of $11.68 billion which is up by 6.0% compared to last year. Revenues came in far ahead of consensus estimates at $11.48 billion.Sales growth was accompanied by operating margin gains resulting in net earnings increasing by 23.9% to $606 million.Thanks to rather aggressive share repurchases over the past year, which have reduced the outstanding float by some 9%, earnings per share grew even quicker as they came in at $2.10 per share. Earnings did comfortably beat consensus estimates at $1.96 per share.The company noted that repurchases aided earnings to the tune of $0.15 per share, but analysts of course have already largely factored in this fact in their estimates.Growth Driven Across The BoardIconic CEO and founder Frederick Smith was very much pleased with the performance of the company at the start of the fiscal year.The company's main express business posted a 3.7% increase in revenues towards $6.86 billion. Notably higher package volumes offset a modest decline in envelopes. More important, the operating margins of the unit improved by 130 basis points to 5.4% of sales, fueling a 35% increase in operating earnings towards $369 million. These gains were the result of the initiatives which the company has undertaken in order to improve the performance of the unit.The ground unit remains the star performer, this time posting a 8.4% increase in sales towards $2.96 billion. The company managed to expand its already fat operating margins by another 70 basis points to 18.4% of sales. Of course the continued growth in e-commerce is a driver behind the sales growth which aided the margins as well.The freight segment was the unit which actually posted the quickest growth in terms of sales. Revenues rose by 13.4% to $1.61 billion driven by strong less-than-truckload shipments. Operating earnings jumped by 70% to $168 million with margins improving by 340 basis points to 10.4% of sales on the back of sales growth and strong cost control.Outlook And Rate HikesOn the back of the strong first quarter results, FedEx has reaffirmed the full year earnings forecast of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. Underlying this outlook is a flat year-on-year fuel impact, moderate economic growth and the implications from the anticipated rate hike. Consensus estimates for the upcoming year stood at $8.84 per share.As of January 5 0f 2015, FedEx will raise its rates across all of its divisions by an average of 4.9% going forwards. So far the notion that there is low or no real inflation in today's economy!Solid Financial Position, Premium ValuationFedEx ended the quarter on a financial solid footing holding $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents as its debt position of some $4.7 billion results in a very much manageable $2.3 billion net debt position. After years of strong cash flows, FedEx is upping investments in the business again, with capital expenditures increasing by more than a quarter to $720 million in the past quarter. Total full year capital spending is anticipated to rise towards $4.2 billion.Currently, FedEx has some 289 million shares outstanding which at $158 per share implies a valuation of some $45-$46 billion for the entire business. Based on trailing sales of $46 billion and earnings of $2.2 billion, this values equity at 1 times sales and 21 times earnings. Based on the full year outlook, shares are valued at around 18 times anticipated earnings for the upcoming fiscal year.Thoughts To ConsiderJust last week I had a look at the prospects for FedEx after analysts at Morgan Stanley cited a few reasons why the first quarter earnings report could come in very strong, as it did.Factoring in the 5% hike in prices and some volume growth and revenues of $50 billion per annum could be very much attainable at a run rate somewhere between late 2015 or in the first half of 2016. This is as the company targets 10% operating margins, which implies more operational gains can be achieved from the current reported margins of 8.5%.Officially the 10% target is set for 2016, but FedEx appears to make great progress which could indicate operating margins of $5 billion, or net earnings of close to $3 billion one to two years from now. Including some share repurchases and earnings of $11-$12 per share are not unthinkable of for 2016. This comes down to a valuation at around 13-14 times earnings two years ahead in time.Shares have already priced in a great deal of improvements already, being up nearly 50% so far this year on the back of this ambitious plan at which the company is making great progress. The aggressive share repurchase program has aided momentum as well, with the company no longer being authorized shares at the current moment. This comes after the company bought back 5.3 million shares over the past quarter thereby exhausting its current repurchase authority.As such I remain cautious despite the targeted improvements and continued anticipated e-commerce growth. Shares trade at elevated multiples based on today's earnings, but the company provides great visibility and earnings growth ahead. Yet after the momentum ride, it is too late in my eyes to jump the momentum bandwagon given the current risk-reward scenario."
2501275,60151,2014-09-17T09:19:11-04:00,"FedEx reported earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.This positive quarterly announcement has cemented my bullish stance on FedEx.In my previous article, I discussed how FedEx would benefit from several initiatives such as a fleet modernization.","This morning FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares spiked nearly 3% amid a positive earnings report. Analysts were expecting $1.96 in earnings per share on revenue of $11.48 billion. FedEx blew away estimates reporting $2.10 EPS on revenue of $11.7 billion. FedEx also reaffirmed its outlook on 2015 earnings, guiding for $8.50 to $9.00 per share in earnings. The company also announced that they repurchased 5.3 million shares during the quarter and announced it will pay its next $.20 dividend on October 1st.CFO Alan Graf, Jr. commented on the quarter, ""FedEx reported strong first quarter results, as all three of our transportation segments drove higher revenues and improved profitability year over year."" (Source: Earnings Release) The operating margin improved to 8.5% from 7.2% in the previous year. The crux of the reason for the margin improvement was due to the company's profit improvement programs and lower pension expenses. These benefits, however, were partially offset by higher aircraft maintenance expense due to the timing of engine maintenance, so improvements will come in future quarters as well. Moreover, with rate increases, which will average 4.9%, effective January 15th, margins will expand further.In my previous article, ""FedEx: Business Fundamental Improving And Shareholder Wealth Being Created,"" when FDX was trading in the mid $140 range, I opined that its initiatives such as the fleet modernization would expand margins. Further, I discussed how shareholders would see wealth creation from a steady and increasing dividend coupled with a share buyback program. With margins set to expand further, FDX is certainly a stable company to add as a cornerstone of a long-term portfolio."
2503795,69815,2014-09-18T05:19:03-04:00,September is passing quickly. The busiest time of the year for FedEx and UPS is approaching. Is now a good time to buy?UPS just announced its seasonal hiring numbers. Does this hint anything about its expectations for the upcoming holiday season ?FedEx or UPS? Or both?,"Summary:September is already half over. The holidays are in the crosshairs. UPS just announced their seasonal hiring plans. Everything seems to be moving so quickly. Is now a good time to buy logistics companies ?Avoiding another holiday disaster:Last year proved to be a mistake when UPS was unable to deliver some holiday packages on time. The mistake was a damaging one for UPS as the stock took a 7% haircut that it still hasn't fully recovered from. In an aggressive move to ensure timely delivery this holiday season, UPS announced this morning plans to hire between 90,000 and 95,000 seasonal holiday employees. This is huge news because for the past three years UPS only hired 55,000 seasonal workers, and only 50,000 four years ago. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) just announced it will be hiring 50,000 seasonal employees - a 25% increase over 2013.Another big holiday sales season ?This article may help explain the drastic increase in seasonal hiring at UPS (in addition to last season's shipping disaster). Citing increased mobile commerce, free shipping, and in store pickup promotions, e-commerce website Volusion is calling for 9% growth this season for small and mid-sized online retailers. Their prediction for total US e-commerce sales is even more aggressive - a 15.5% increase for 2014. If these numbers prove true, they will prove good reasons to be long logistics through 2015.Time to buy? I think so.If you are looking for an entry point into these companies, now could be a good time. If the sales estimates prove to be right for the approaching holiday season, FedEx and UPS could see some gains in stock price through the new year. Aside from the strong 2014 holiday sales predictions, both companies are looking at solid growth in the coming years. For the next three years, FedEx is looking at year over year EPS growth in the mid to high teens, and a steady 4.5-5% year over year revenue growth. In comparison, UPS is looking at EPS growth in the low to mid teens with revenue growth similarly at 4.5-5% over the next three years.Which is better?Both are solid companies, but I think FedEx is the best of breed. FedEx is trading at a cheap 14x Forward PE, while it has less debt than UPS and higher growth projections. Meanwhile UPS is trading at a slightly more expensive 17x Forward PE with considerably more debt on its books. FedEx has a Debt/Assets Ratio of 0.14 and a Debt/Equity Ratio of 0.31. In comparison UPS has a less attractive Debt/Assets Ratio of 0.34 and Debt/Equity Ratio of 2.31. It's important to note that UPS pays a 2.75% dividend, which will make it more attractive to some investors. Personally, I'd rather take FedEx's less debt, slightly higher growth, and lower Forward PE over UPS' dividend.Risks:Both companies have had their bad press - FedEx with the recent federal drug trafficking charges (UPS was charged and settled a few years back) and UPS with its recent data breach. I recently wrote about the FedEx charges and why they won't affect the company. I stand by that article, and as far as UPS' bad press - it shouldn't do much harm either. Why? Because for the most part, these are the only two major logistics companies in the United States, aside from USPS which has its own shipping limitations. The only things that will harm these companies in the future is bad execution - if they fail to execute during the holidays like UPS did last year - the stocks will get hurt. But after last year's UPS fiasco, I'd bet money that this year goes smoothly for both companies."

Revenue of $11.7 billion increased by 6.2% year-over-year and exceeded estimates by $220 million. Earnings per share of $2.10 beat estimates by 7% or 14 cents per share. Earnings increased 37% year-over-year. The company experienced strong growth at FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and the FedEx Express U.S. domestic business. Operating income increased 24% to $987 million. The increase in operating income was a result of higher volumes and increased yields for the three segments.These positive results reinforce my bullish outlook for FedEx for the long-term. The improvements in the economy are evident in these results. Businesses are shipping more products because consumers are purchasing more goods. Earnings also benefited as fuel prices remained stable. The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2015 EPS guidance to be in the $8.50 to $9.00 range.Although I didn't predict FedEx to exceed its earnings estimate this quarter in my last article, I did mention that FedEx would likely outperform the S&P 500 over the long-term. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the article was published and I expect it to continue doing so. FedEx is increasing shipping rates beginning in early 2015. I think that the higher demand that the company is seeing does justify a rate increase. These increases should lead to higher revenue for the company as of January 5, 2015 when they go into effect. My outlook for FedEx remains positive as above average earnings increases are likely to catalyze the stock to continue outperforming the S&P 500."
2508045,71215,2014-09-19T14:40:48-04:00,FedEx beat earnings expectations and posted strong guidance.Management was unclear about future cash repatriation initiatives.The company has posted increasing sales and has strengthened its position within the industry.,"BackgroundOn September 17, 2014, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) reported Q1 FY 2015 net income of $606 million ($2.10 per share) on sales of $11.7 billion, compared to net income of $489 million ($1.53 per share) on sales of $11.0 billion in the same period last year. These figures beat Estimize-reported consensus estimates of $1.97 per share on sales of $11.47 billion.FedEx Corporation provides transportation services in the United States and internationally. Its core business is to provide shipping services to deliver packages and heavy freight. The company was founded in 1971 and is based in Memphis Tennessee. It currently employs over 231,500 people. These numbers are based on a fully-diluted share count of 289 million in 2014 and 319 million in 2013.The company operates within three segments: Express (58.6% of sales, 37.4% of operating income), Ground (25.3% of sales, 55.3% of operating income), and Freight (13.8% of sales, 17.0% of operating income)Its primary publicly-traded competitor is United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS). Within freight or less-than-truckload shipments, it competes with Arkansas Best (NASDAQ: ABFS), YRC Worldwide (NASDAQ: YRCW), and ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ: ARCB).Key PointsGuidanceWhat to look for in Q2New Buyback authorizationManagement stated that the company had completed its share repurchase authorization. Look to see if management expands its buyback program in the next quarter.Margin expansion within the company's Express segmentThe company's Express segment, which ships packages within the United States and internationally posted an operating margin of 5.4% versus 4.1% in the previous year. This is the company's lowest-margin segment, but also accounts for the most sales ($6.86 billion in the quarter). I would expect that management would look to take steps in order to expand margins within this segment.Fuel pricesManagement mentioned that its guidance assumptions are based upon ""moderate global growth and stable fuel prices."" Fuel is a major cost for any transportation company, and if fuel prices decrease, I would expect substantial margin expansion for the company's operations.Quick TakeI was impressed that management disclosed full-year guidance in such an early part of the year. Furthermore, I like how they explained what assumptions they baked in to the guidance (2.1% U.S. GDP growth in 2014, 3% in 2015, industrial production growth of 4.1% and 3.8%, etc. Such transparency displays that management has a long-term plan in place and is confident in the company's go-forward strategy. Additionally, by explaining how they arrived at their guidance lets us know that they are confident in the various levers that drive the business.Management seemed especially impressed with its FedEx Ground segment, which contributed $2.92 billion to sales and had operating income of $5.45 million, representing a margin of 18.4%.My only concern with management's posture is that when pressed about the company's dividend yield (which they admitted was ""sub par"") they did not give a very clear answer and stated that they will ""increase dividends at some level."" I understand that the company is making a lot of capital investments, but a bit more clarity here would have been helpful. Management also stated that it will ""keep its eye on"" the company's buyback program, but deferred the issue as being up to the board.FedEx had an outstanding quarter and is well-positioned to maintain its position as a leader in package transportation services. As a non-union carrier, it is able to save substantially on labor costs compared to UPS and YRC Worldwide. Should management's forecasts about global growth prove accurate, and fuel prices remain stable, I would expect FedEx to continue to outperform.Transcript available on Seeking Alpha here. 8-K with financials available here."

The Memphis-based shipment major, that has taken good care of shipment delivery since its inception in 1971, has had a gratifying fourth quarter. Let's peek into the reasons why this quarter could be even better, kick-starting a new fiscal year.ExpectationsFedEx, high on a successful fiscal year 2014, is looking forward to an even more fulfilling quarter and fiscal year ahead. Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer, said, ""Fiscal 2014 was a good year for FedEx and we expect fiscal 2015 to be even better.""Analysts are expecting a top line of $11.48 billion in the quarter. The 4.1% improvement from last year same period's $11.02 billion could come on the heels of a thriving Ground business, while contributions from the Express and international divisions could also add to the company's performance.Express division top line could improve on the back of bettering yields on both domestic as well as international divisions while Ground revenues growth could be propelled by market share gains and yield management strategies. Fuel prices could have a far-reaching effect on the company's prospective performance. While in the corresponding period last year, it cost FedEx $150 million, it's expected to go down this year by a whopping $85 million, cutting operating costs.Analysts expect quarter's earnings to go up to $1.96 a share from last year same quarter's $1.50 a share. FedEx is looking at a full year earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.FedEx Ground to be the chief growth boosterThe past quarter went particularly well for the company, as its diverse divisions pulled off total sales of $11.8 billion, taking the annual score to $45.6 billion. FedEx Ground was the key driver of growth, expanding 8% to $3.01 billion. Transporting packages at affordable pricing, Ground division has emerged as the apple of the e-retailers' eye, enabling them to offer free to low-cost courier services.The show is anticipated to get even better with global B2C online shopping sales expected to touch $1.5 trillion in 2014, rising 20.1%. The possibility, therefore, bodes immensely well for the company, which puts a lot of stress on growing its e-commerce sales. With an ever-increasing chunk of customers taking to online shopping, FedEx's imminent results from the Ground segment could be pretty impressive.Revenues from the SmartPost business, which delivers lightweight packages to residences at reasonable rates in collaboration with the U.S. Postal Service, could remain subdued as was seen in the previous quarter when shipping pattern changes made by a large customer resulted in volumes going down by 8%.FedEx Ground proved to be the most profitable segment for the company's business last fiscal year. Though garnering only a quarter of FedEx's top line, it obtained an operating income of $586 million and an operating margin of 19.5%. The increased margin was on account of revenue per package and volume growth, which could be seen in the first quarter too.The new pricing mechanism under which packages will be charged on the basis of dimensional weight, could take Ground division's margins even higher from 2015, as it is slated to be effective from January onward.Margins could improve with Express showing upFedEx Express has been faring well for the past few quarters as the company is taking special care in reducing costs through restructuring, pushing up the segment's operating margin to 6.8% in the previous quarter.The restructuring plans, comprising modernization of air fleet and employee voluntary retirement program, could prominently pay off in 2015. The initiatives, targeted at bettering profits by $1.6 billion by the end of 2016, have already started showing results from the last fiscal.The improving trend in this segment's operating margins together with solid backing from Ground will help FedEx achieve its overall margin of 10%, something it accomplished in the previous quarter and looks poised to touch in the quarter under review.International expansion could add upFedEx is investing in profitable markets across the globe, which is bolstering the Express segment. FedEx unveiled a new North Pacific regional hub in Japan's Kansai International Airport in April this year, that would serve as an intersection between the US and northern Asia. The company has upgraded its logistics in China where demand for healthcare products has escalated owing to the country's aging population. FedEx, realizing that India's coming forward as a considerable market, started FedEx International Direct Priority Ocean services, a reasonable and fast freight delivery service, for shipping cargo from India to the US. The quarter under review could show glimpses of the positive outcome of these initiatives.Moreover, the expansion under way in Europe could also come in handy. FedEx has opened up 100 stations in the continent, launched intra-country services in 13 European nations and hired 3,600 employees in around three years.Wrapping upGrowing demand for online retail seems to be the biggest boon for FedEx, which has been earning the major chunk of its profits from the Ground segment. With growing e-commerce and improving margins, the first quarter could set a positive tone for the rest of the year. Analysts are hopeful about the results, and there are no reasons to believe otherwise."
2494185,25120,2014-09-15T03:10:47-04:00,"FedEx is scheduled to release earnings this week, as analysts are turning bullish.I agree that the company operates in a very favorable operating environment with growth accelerating and oil prices being down.That being said, the market has priced in a lot of good news already over the past year, limiting appeal in my eyes.","Ahead of FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) earnings report on Wednesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley are already providing some color on the anticipated earnings release. Analysts cite a few reasons why the earnings report could come in ahead of expectations, and I cannot argue with them given that the company is benefiting from strong economic growth, e-commerce growth and recently lower oil prices.That being said, I don't necessarily share the upbeat recommendation for the stock which has risen significantly already over the past twelve months in anticipation of further earnings improvements as the company continues to target operating margins north of 10% going forwards.Morgan Stanley Is UpbeatAnalyst William Greene is upbeat about the prospects for FedEx's first quarter earnings release for which he believes earnings should at a minimum come in at consensus, having the potential to beat versus consensus estimates.Greene identified four specific targets which might result in a surprise towards the upside. For starters it the fact that airfreight demand trends have improved internationally. The company has furthermore improved its cost run-rate as less-than-truckload tonnages were the driver behind the big upside surprise in the fourth quarter. Finally, fuel surcharges have provided a drag on earnings for most of next year while they could add to $0.20 per share in earnings.Greene noted that shares have traded at a premium valuation versus the wider market, while currently the company trades at a price-earnings ratio which is equivalent to the average of the past decade. This offers potential for valuation multiple expansion if operational momentum continues.August Investor PresentationLast month, FedEx presented itself again to the investment community. The company stresses the bundled services which it offers with both the express, ground, freight and services business providing excellent value to its end customers.For the long run, FedEx has set itself a target to achieve operating margins north of 10%, as it aims to grow earnings per share by some 10-15% per year on the back of profitable revenue growth.Underlying this assumption and the long term guidance is the continued growth of e-commerce in today's economy as the express business is targeting $1.6 billion in annual earnings improvements towards the end of 2016. At the same time, the ground business continues to report superior margins while it gains market share and freight margins are anticipated to bounce back.Solid Ending To 2014Earlier this year, that is June the 18th, FedEx posted its results for the entire year of 2014. The company ended the year holding some $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents as the company held $4.7 billion in total debt, resulting in a net debt position of $1.8 billion.It should be noted that the business has other long term obligations including lease obligations as well as pension and other post-retirement liabilities which in total exceed $4 billion.For the year, FedEx posted sales of $45.6 billion on which it posted earnings of $2.1 billion with operating earnings totaling 7.6% of sales.With some 295 million shares outstanding, which have increased in value towards $154 per share, equity is being valued at roughly $45 billion. As such equity in the business is valued at 1 times sales and roughly 21-22 times annual earnings.Steady Growth, Better Days AnticipatedSince 2005, FedEx has increased its sales by some 50%, increasing revenues from about $29 billion to little over $45 billion which implies that sales have grown at about 4-5% per annum.Earnings have followed a similar trend as the outstanding share base of the company resulted in a stable outstanding share base. For the past year FedEx posted operating margins of about 7.6%, a ratio which it targets to be at least 10% in a not too distant future.Achieving this on sales of $50 billion could result in operating earnings of $5 billion which combined with negligible interest payments and statutory tax rates of about 35% could yield GAAP earnings of about $3 billion going forwards.Final TakeawayI must say that I like the prospects for transportation businesses which are geared to consumers like FedEx and its major competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS), being well positioned to benefit from the increased traffic resulting from continued e-commerce growth.Undoubtedly this consistent trend already provides a real tailwind to the business and the wider industry although it might also attract longer term competition from the likes of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) which might become a dominant force putting rates down. On the other hand new developments including that of drones being opted by Amazon but also by other major giants like Google and Facebook, could pose serious long term threats if those parties are committed to change the overall industry.For now the tailwinds remain however, although the business still has a lot to prove. The valuation in the low twenties time earnings multiple is not appealing, and only if the company manages to meet its entire 10% operating margins target, the earnings multiple will drop towards 15 times earnings.As such I remain cautious despite the undoubtedly improving operating conditions, also noticing that shares have risen some 40-50% over the past year. This has increased the expectations about the operating performance in anticipation of the targeted margin expansion. Therefore I continue to be cautious. While margin gains and sales growth will undoubtedly be demonstrated, the shares have priced in a lot of good news already, limiting the risk-reward potential in my eyes."
2492995,32001,2014-09-14T04:16:13-04:00,"The share repo should be almost done.Given paltry free-cash-flow, FDX adding debt.Think stock is fairly valued here, although crude oil drop very helpful.","FedEx (NYSE:FDX), the air and ground freight juggernaut that changed the lexicon of American overnight delivery (""FedEx it""), is scheduled to report their fiscal Q1 '15 earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, September 17, 2014.Analyst consensus is expecting $1.95 in earnings per share (EPS) on $11.46 billion in revenues, for expected year-over-year (y/y) growth of 27% and 4% respectively.Despite the drop in crude oil, the revenue and EPS estimates have remained constant since the fiscal Q4 '14 report in mid-June '14.Fiscal Q4 '14 was actually a pretty good quarter for the freight giant as revenue grew 2% but EPS was up 15% y/y. The operating margin hit 10% last quarter too, which is considered Nirvana for FDX and a long-time goal that hasn't been seen in some time. In fiscal Q4 '14, Express continued to be weak in terms of volume, while Ground and Freight are pulling the sled. Express volumes grew 2.5% while Ground grew 8%, a pattern that has been in evidence for some time.The reason revenue is growing low to mid-single digits and EPS is growing high-teens to 20% is FDX's ""profit improvement"" plan announced in which reduced expenses and utilized the excess free-cash-flow into share repurchases. Just since Nov '13, FDX has reduced fully-diluted shares outstanding by 23 million, just shy of the 25 million goal.The current quarter:The drop in the price of crude oil is one major positive this quarter, as it has resulted in lower jet fuel prices as measured by this indicator, which is the IATA Fuel Price Analysis page.According to our internal spreadsheet, fuel costs vary as a % of FDX revenues from 9% to 12%, since August, 2010. FDX is protected by a fuel surcharge which lags a bit on the way up and down.If there is EPS upside this quarter, I wouldn't be surprised to see it come from a fuel surcharge that was taken off late, and thus added to operating margins as the price of jet fuel / crude oil fell.A perfect environment for FDX is an expanding economy, expanding volumes, and falling fuel prices. We may have seen that in fiscal Q1 '15.The negatives:The Department of Justice criminal indictment is a major long-term negative for FDX and the other companies caught in this web. If you look at history, there aren't too many companies that are criminally indicted, that really prosper, with Arthur Andersen and BP coming to mind. Arthur Andersen was essentially shut down by the government (rightly or wrongly) following the halcyon days of the late 1990's and BP isn't trading too far above its market price when it was criminally indicted for the Gulf of Mexico - Macondo oil spill, to which it ultimately pled guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter in late 2012.It isn't just the corporate reputation that takes a beating, but the time and resources that are required to fight the litigation internally, that can detract from shareholder value over time.Still this could take a few years to resolve and if FDX can settle the issue and get away with monetary damages, it might be considered a victory for FDX.(As a sidebar, no pun intended, CVS, the retail pharmacy giant also named in the indictment, has seen its stock hit an all-time high recently near $80 - $81 per share.)Valuation:FDX's 17(x) forward multiple on fiscal '15 EPS of $8.82 is reasonable given the expected 29% EPS growth this year. If we look out over the next 3 years, expected revenue growth will average 5% and EPS will average 22% so FDX will continue to be an expense-reduction and operating leverage story.When I look at the P/L and FDX's balance sheet I see payroll declining from over 40% of revenues to its current 36% and the pension and retirement liabilities also declining over the last 3 years, which has been replaced by a great amount of long-term debt.That isn't a criticism, but it looks as if FDX has replaced the uncertainty and the complexity of pension and post retirement health care liabilities with the certainty of term debt and fixed interest expense. Not a bad trade-off in my opinion.FDX's price to cash-flow is 10(x) currently and price to free-cash-flow (FCF) is like 60(x) and not material. FDX has never been a big free-cash-flow generator, or maybe put a better way, given FDX's fixed-cost base and its operating leverage, FDX has never been a consistent, steady free-cash-flow generator, like a lot of industrials can be.The only way I can figure it from our spreadsheet is that given FDX's thin free-cash-flow or volatile FCF, the addition of the term debt is financing a lot of these share repurchases.The last 3 quarters FDX's 4-quarter trailing free-cash-flow has been $1.4 bl, $1.1 bl and $731k for the most recent quarter. Compare that to FDX's ""capital returned"" in the form of dividend and share repos of $1.5 bl., $4.2 bl and $5.0 bl. for the same quarters, respectively.FDX's debt-to-cap has risen from 10% to 25% in the last 9 quarters. Once FDX announced the share repo plan, a number of hedge funds jumped into the stock, maybe looking for more. Locking in term debt at these absolute levels of credit spreads isn't a bad idea, let's just hope the rating agencies agree.The CFO is earning his keep.Our internal intrinsic value estimate for FDX is $142 per share, while Morningstar's discounted cash-flow model assigns an estimated intrinsic value estimate to FDX of $146.The last time we wrote about FDX in June '14 here, we concluded that the giant freight company was fairly-valued and I still cannot draw anything but the same conclusion. The stock popped after the June '14 report, ran a little bit but has stayed in basically the same trading range.Technically FDX is above its 50 and 200 day moving averages, and looks ok on a chart.Given the drop in crude oil, FDX will likely report a decent quarter with some EPS upside if the lag in the surcharge fattened the margin. The previous EPS guidance for fiscal '15 in June '14 was for $8.50 to $9.00 per share, versus the then consensus of $8.45, which has since risen to $8.82.We have sold the majority of our FDX between $145 - $150 and the fact is we could miss a nice move if crude continues to fall and volumes continue to strengthen.FDX is a return-to-global growth play, but I do think there is a lot of good news in the stock."
2497585,70615,2014-09-16T04:16:16-04:00,"The rise in eCommerce comes as great help for the company, helping to boost demand for courier delivery services.The company is implementing cost cutting measures that actually lead to higher profitability.The global economic recovery is helping FedEX to achieve higher levels of growth.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has had an exceptional two years, increasing in price from $90 to $150. The outstanding share price performance comes with further upside expectations. The company continues to steal market share from competitors, with the help of long-term growth in ecommerce. The company is also helping its growth by implementing cost cutting measures that actually make a difference and boost profit margins. Furthermore, FedEx is greatly assisted by the recovery in the global economy. The company share price also helps to see the real opportunity present to enter the stock long.Ecommerce RisingEcommerce has been on a sharp increase, as more consumers begin to embrace the convenience and affordability of online retail. Ecommerce in the US is expected to grow from $260 billion in 2013 to $400 billion by 2018. Even at that rate, the data represents only an 11% of total retail sales, which shows plenty of promising potential for the future. FedEx fits nicely with the ecommerce expansion as it is one of the market leaders in courier delivery services. This helped the company to increase its revenue growth from $7.5 billion in 2010 to $11.5 billion in the 2014 fiscal year. This helped the Ground division of FedEx to achieve a 12% annual compound growth, making it the leader in the company. FedEx Ground managed to deliver operating margin of 16.8% in the last year. It can clearly be seen that the expansion of ecommerce with the assistance of FedEx Ground will likely further increase profitability.Cost-Cutting MeasuresCost cutting is one of the most important drivers of profit growth for FedEx Express. The company has already taken measures by implementing staffing reduction, with the use of the early retirement program. This has greatly helped to reduce fixed costs for FedEx Express.The second cost-cutting program involves the shrinkage of jets that are used for express operations. The goal is to further retire a number of older aircrafts, such as A310s and MD10s. The FedEx jet fleet is expected to decrease by 13 aircraft in the next two years, amounting to a 4% shrink. In some instances the company is replacing the older jets with the new smaller jets that allow for lower trip costs. The decision to decrease the jet amount comes due to a number of customers preferring the cheaper deferred delivery options. This allows FedEx to reduce their cost by allowing the passenger carriers with extra cargo space to deliver the packages. The cost cutting measures will have a profound impact on the company in terms of increased profitability and further growth.Economic RecoveryThe recovery in the global economic growth comes as great news for FedEx. The company also acknowledged that trade growth is almost always ahead of the global GDP growth. By addressing the fixed cost structure, FedEx was well positioned to make the most of its fixed assets and to grow its profit margin once the economy began to recover. The company believes that global GDP growth will increase from 2.2% in 2013, up to 2.6% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015. As the economy continues to grow, FedEx will further benefit from the rising volumes and a better pricing power.Stock MovementIt can easily be seen that the share price is in a clear uptrend. The 20, 50 and 100 moving averages are showing further uptrend. Furthermore, MACD indicator is also showing an upward direction. Some might say that it is too late to enter, however that is what brings me to the most important aspect of price action analysis, the breakout. It can be seen that the price recently broke the $144 mark, which is a clear indication of a further trend. The overall chart history is the best indicator available in providing future expectation, and in this case the price is in a clear uptrend. The small pullback of the $153 mark was a sign of the cool off, before further continuation. It is likely that the price will continue rising with the target of $200. From a price action point of view, the stock provides a perfect opportunity to enter long.FedEx shares should be on the watch list of both active and passive growth-oriented investors. The active investors will be required to employ higher risk management tactics in order to achieve highest reward in the periods of price rallies. The passive investors will likely profit on the long-term growth of the company in the next couple of years.ConclusionFedEx is an exceptional company that is displaying great opportunity. The company expects the EPS to reach $9 in the current fiscal year, which equals to the 33% gain. This data will strongly be assisted by the restructuring of fleet and the growth in FedEx Ground. The longer term also offers perspective growth with the further improvements in the global economy. Based on all the fundamental data with the assistance of favourable stock movement, FedEx will likely to continue rising. It is not too late to enter the stock for those that are interested in getting on the growth ride."
2438705,52422,2014-08-20T13:00:32-04:00,"Shares of FedEx are undervalued by 12%.The trend towards e-commerce, across the retail landscape, will increase the volume of goods requiring transport, and drive sales growth higher.Fair value indicated at $167/share, with an implied terminal EBITDA multiple of 6.70x.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services domestically and internationally. The Company operates in four business segments: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. The profitability of FedEx is directly linked to the state of the macroeconomy, as periods of global growth drive demand in the highly cyclical transportation industry. Conversely, periods of either anemic or sedated economic activity pose a significant risk to revenue generating capabilities.In that the volume of goods being produced and consumed dictates the volume of goods requiring transport, FedEx can conceivably be looked at as a global growth watchdog, a stock that should oscillate according to the economic outlook. Not only growth in developed markets, but also in emerging markets. As FedEx continues to expand across Latin America, Europe, and Africa, the heightened emerging market exposure will ideally diversify country-specific risk, and augment long-term profitability. An increasingly desirable economic climate, and positive improvements in the overall health of the consumer, are essential for yielding top-line growth.These conditions met, a developing trend in the way that consumers are spending may also have positive implications for FedEx in the years to come. As more customers forego the brick and mortar shopping experience, and instead gravitate towards online retail, FedEx stands to profit from the expanding e-commerce space, and a transforming retail landscape. Below, the price of FedEx is displayed along with the Consumer Credit Report, and the Consumer Price Index. Both economic indicators are intended to reflect the health of the American consumer, and here, highlight the tendency for shares of FedEx to rise in accordance with economic activity, over the long-term. Commodity Risk: FuelThe price and availability of fuel is inextricably linked to the operating profitability of FedEx's extensive transportation network. An increase in the market price for fuel necessitates the implementation of indexed fuel surcharges. These surcharges are intended to alleviate any correlative expense impact of rising costs, as they relate to the operation of aircraft and vehicles. However, there exists a danger that higher surcharges will push customers away from the higher-yielding express services, and consequently drive demand towards lower-yielding, deferred or ground services. This commodity risk management surcharge does not fluctuate with whiplash delta sensitivity, rather, changes in the surcharge lag the price of fuel by six to eight weeks. In this respect, we can look at the price of fuel today as a metric by which to gauge the demand for higher yielding services, and estimate operating profitability over the near-term. With the October '14 contracts of Brent Crude futures currently trading around the 102/101 level, off of mid-June highs with a 113 handle, one can speculate that there will be a material increase in the demand for express services, and that lower fuel costs will stimulate FedEx's forward operating profitability. In order to explore this relationship, the daily spot price of Brent Crude oil, as measured by the United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:BNO), is plotted against the daily price performance of FedEx, over a one-year period, on the chart below.Both numbers are adjusted for beta so as to isolate the correlational component from broad market volatility. The correlation coefficient of -0.33 reflects a moderate negative relationship, so that as the spot price of Brent Crude has fluctuated over the past year, the price per share of FedEx has tended to react inversely. While the statistical significance of this number is arguable, it underlines the potential for commodity risk to impede significant price appreciation down the line.Fair ValueCurrently trading at 7.45x EV/EBITDA, shares of FedEx look undervalued relative to the delivery services industry average 10.91x EV/EBITA, trailing twelve months. The charts below demonstrate the sensitivity of the total equity value to changes in the forward revenue growth rate, and illustrate the corresponding free cash flow, and EBITDA growth projections. The FCF and EBITDA growth forecast is determined using the consensus revenue growth rate, indicated below.A fair value estimate of $167/share is derived using the perpetuity growth method, where the terminal perpetuity growth rate is 3.0%, and the discount rate is 11%. Assumptions include $1828mm net debt, and 285.4mm diluted shares outstanding. Sensitivity analysis for the total enterprise value, total equity value, implied terminal EBITDA multiple, and price per share is provided below.ConclusionShares of FedEx look to have 12% further upside from here. A long position initiated at current levels would yield a risk adjusted return of 2%, at fair value. Bottom line, FedEx is a buy if you're bullish on the U.S. economy."

The late 2013 relative outperformance versus UPS has continued in 2014, so that's a positive change from the three previous years. With the short-term moving average testing below the medium term, the stock pulling back below $150 might raise worries of a double-top. Given relative valuations, traders are hoping to see the stock trade at quadruple the 2009 low. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx is supporting their stock with a massive buyback and insiders continue to take advantage of the stock trading at or near all-time highs. Relative valuations versus the industry could give the stock support but the stock has tended to show seasonal strength closer to year-end. Consensus is down from the $1.97 of three months ago but the company probably needs to report above that on revenue of closer to $11.48 billion to support another bullish push into new all-time highs. The biggest worry is the stock has risen 70% in just over one year and hasn't had its historically normal healthy pullback despite a ruling that 32,500 contractors are to be treated as employees.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

The last two years or so, however, FedEx has painfully discovered that plenty of businesses and individuals can wait another day and would prefer to pay less for delivery of a parcel.And that leaves the company Fred Smith founded and built -- and still runs at age 69 -- with an asset mismatch:For the year ended May 31, 60% of FedEx's assets were tied up in its speedy Express segment, and capital spending in recent years has leaned toward that segment, as well, as FedEx slowly retires a fleet of aging MD-11 and MD-10 wide body jets in favor of more modern and fuel-efficient Boeing planes.The overall corporate goal is to reach an operating margin of 10%. The laggard Express segment, which also accounts for about 60% of revenue, hasn't broken 5% the last three years for an operating margin. FedEx Ground, meanwhile, the wheels-stay-on-the-pavement unit, cranked out operating margins between 16.8% and 18.4% the last three years. And even though Ground is far smaller than Express, Ground has out-earned, on an absolute dollar basis, its speeder brother each of the last three years.FDX Return on Assets (TTM) data by YChartsIn transportation, slow is good these days, as one sees from a return-on-asserts chart featuring FedEx's slower competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS) and an even slower transportation giant, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). Transportation shares have outpaced the broader market by a lot over the last 18 months or so, and FedEx, UPS and Union Pacific have all risen on that tide.FDX data by YChartsInvestors seem to think the turnaround is all but finished at FedEx. But is it? The company laid off 3,600 employees to cut costs, but that's a small number when FedEx employs more than 300,000 and also has many thousands of ""independent contractors"" (a mountain of class action litigation challenges this keep-the-drivers-off-the-books approach) driving its local routes in the U.S. In investor presentations and the 10-K, FedEx lays out a broad profit-improvement plan to lift annual income by $1.6 billion (run rate) by the end of 2016.But the disclosure is vague and mostly sounds like stuff that ought of be standard operating procedure for a company like FedEx: in addition to the layoffs and modernizing the air fleet, ""we are transforming our U.S. domestic express network by closing and realigning regional and district facilities, reorganizing pickup and delivery operations while maintaining our outstanding service levels, improving flight and crew scheduling, refining aircraft maintenance processes.""It hardly inspires confidence. Yet the company, under Fred Smith, has delivered so well for so long that FedEx gets the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps a strengthening economy will help out enough on the revenue side to make the plan work.The betting here is that the domestic Ground unit can improve its already-strong performance more easily that the lagging Express unit can achieve the corporate goal of 10% operating margin. Why? Transportation is all about route density. The more dumpsters a trash collector empties in a single neighborhood, the more efficient it is. Multiple pizza deliveries to the same apartment block? A money maker. And domestically is where both FedEx and UPS have route density. A Peapod truck driving blocks and blocks between grocery deliveries? A loser.For all its talk about serving more than 220 countries, FedEx gets 72% of its revenue from the U.S. and domestic sales have grown the past three years while international receipts have been flat. UPS sales are about 75% domestic. Its advantage of late has been that its business mix is skewed toward pickup and delivery on the ground. That capitalizes on consumers' increasing use of Internet shopping but leaves UPS less vulnerable to global businesses that have figured out how to avoid having the ship items on a rush basis.UPS's route density in the U.S., among other factors, makes UPS a productivity machine, as we've written. And despite holiday delivery snafus this past year, the trend to Internet constitutes a strong wind at UPS's back.While the CEO, Smith, is no spring chicken, it's interesting to note that the entire 8-person executive leadership at FedEx averages nearly 60 years of age and the youngest is 55. They've mostly been in their current jobs for a very long time, and that's great continuity. But one wonders where the next generation is and whether FedEx mightn't benefit from some external points of view.FDX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsFedEx during fiscal 2014 bought back $4.9 billion in stock, which is expected to lift fiscal 2015 EPS by 45 cents. The stock cost FedEx $131.83 a share, and in hindsight the long recent period of the stock bouncing around the $90 level seems like it would have been a better time for such an expression of confidence.FDX data by YChartsA 33% dividend hike, to 20 cents quarterly, is welcome, but with a dividend yield well below 1%, nobody's buying this stock for current income.

It is the world's largest provider of guaranteed express delivery services. FedEx operates in over 220 countries worldwide, and it is currently in the midst of a $1.7-billion profit improvement program, which is expected to be 75% complete by 2015.After reporting a surprise earnings beat in June, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced in July that it was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges. The company had previously announced that if convicted, the charges could be material. This past week, the indictment was revised to include money laundering charges. But I believe there are enough catalysts within the company and industry to potentially offset any penalty FedEx may face.Federal Charges & Potential Outcomes:After an almost decade long-investigation, FedEx was indicted on over fifteen federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges in the past month. The indictment claims that the company conspired with several online pharmacies to distribute drugs that were sold in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Instead of looking to immediately settle the case, like competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS), FedEx has pleaded not guilty and plans to fight all charges. Up until the investigation, FedEx has deferred to authorities when it comes to people shipping illegal materials. Although FedEx claims it has offered to help - by asking for a list of names of illegitimate online pharmacies to deny services to - federal authorities still have not provided them a list, nor do they think that FedEx's compliance or offer to help is enough.FedEx should have gone the route of UPS. In March 2013, UPS settled its case with investigators regarding the same matter FedEx is now facing. The company forfeited $40 million in suspected profits, and made changes to its compliance policies with respect to internet pharmacy shippers. At the time, FedEx was also under investigation, but called the investigation ""absurd and disturbing"" and announced that it planned to fight any charges. In hindsight, it probably would have been simpler for FedEx to agree to adjust policies and pay a small fine to end the investigation if it had the opportunity. But now, it has been indicted, and faces $1.6 billion in penalties. According to a July WSJ Article, authorities claim to have e-mail evidence of FedEx executives acknowledging the illegal operations of the online pharmacies and then going out of their way to ensure that the pharmacies could keep doing business with FedEx. If those claims are true, I believe FedEx's case is doomed. Unless FedEx settles, it will face a maximum $1.64 billion fine (twice the $820 million Feds claim it made shipping drugs), plus restitution and forfeiture of profits.My take is this: Worst case, even if the total cost of this investigation to FedEx hits $3 billion (this is a speculative worst case-number, including the $1.64 billion fine plus unknown restitution and incurred legal costs), that will be a small short-term blow to FedEx. This company is raking in almost $12 billion in revenue per quarter. With roughly 287 million shares outstanding, a $3 billion worst-case scenario cost to FedEx would represent about 2.5 quarters' worth of free cash flow. Keep in mind that there is still a possibility that FedEx will settle the case for less. I will explain next why I think FedEx's growth can offset this legal headwind.Growth Catalysts:Profit improvement planIn October 2012, FedEx announced several programs that were aimed at cutting costs and increasing annual profitability by $1.7 billion for the following three years. A breakdown of the cost savings can be seen here. FedEx is currently about halfway through that plan. In its June 2013 conference call, the company said that the plan is still on track to achieve the plan. The annual savings have already been factored into earnings, but the plan is important to highlight as one of the underlying catalysts for the company's growth.Buyback planAs of June, FedEx had just over 5 million shares still authorized for repurchase as part of its previously announced buyback plan. The remaining shares will be repurchased by the end of 2014.Focused ManagementOn the June earnings call, management said that they are laser-focused on improving the operating results of all FedEx business segments. They expect these efforts to contribute to continued revenue growth through 2015.Economic improvementManagement is expecting the global economy to improve, with 2.7% growth for 2014 and 3.1% growth in calendar 2015. They expect the US and China to steadily improve. Global trade is still below historical norms, and is expected to continue to improve throughout 2015.Valuation:P/EFDX has a P/E (Annual) of 22 and a P/E (F1Y) of 13.87. The Forward P/E is less than UPS' 16.67, even though FedEx is expecting higher EPS growth and almost the same growth in cash flow and revenue per share. With this said, I believe the current forward P/E is a bit low. That's because the Forward P/E is trading in the middle of the same range that it was trading in 5 years ago, when FedEx was experiencing less earnings growth.Here are the cash flow and revenue growth estimates that are a result of the catalysts I mentioned above: cash flow will increase 17% in 2015 and 14% in 2016. FedEx is also looking at revenue growth of 4.6% in 2015 and 5.5% in 2016.I believe now could be a good time to start a position in FedEx if you are willing to bet on the approaching holiday season. Otherwise the stock price could get driven up in the fall as investors begin to consider the holiday potential for the company.Risks:There are risks to this investment. While I don't believe that the ongoing federal charges are one of them, there are others. Global growth could be less than expected. FedEx has already had to revise its growth numbers slightly downward a few times in the past couple of years. There's also risk of a dull holiday shipping season, and harsh winter weather affecting shopping and shipping.Conclusion:For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that the ongoing federal case against FedEx will not have a significant impact on the company's stock. I believe the federal charges have already been priced into the stock, and if FedEx settles the case for less than $1.6 billion, it'll be icing on the cake. There are several fundamental catalysts that will continue to drive the growth of the company beyond any effects the federal case may have. FedEx stock recently closed at roughly $149 per share, and analyst price targets range from $145 to $192, with the mean being $163, or 9% from current levels.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Given this share price appreciation lately, combined with strong growth forecasted by analysts, is now the time to consider a stake in the enterprise, or would rival United Parcel (NYSE:UPS) be a better long-term play?Analysts expect great thingsFor the quarter, analysts expect FedEx to report revenue of $11.48 billion. Should this forecast turn out to be accurate, it will represent a respectable 4% increase in revenue compared to the $11.02 billion management reported the same quarter a year earlier. If history repeats itself, the two fastest-growing segments year-over-year will likely be the company's FedEx Ground segment, which grew sales 21% over the past three years, and its FedEx Freight segment, which reported a 9% growth in revenue during this timeframe.From an earnings standpoint, analysts have even higher expectations. For the quarter, Mr. Market expects FedEx to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.96. Should this forecast turn out to be accurate, it will represent a whopping 28% increase over the $1.53 management reported the same quarter last year. This increase will be driven by higher sales, as well as management's cost-cutting initiatives and will set the company on its way to earn the $8.50 to $9.00 per share for the year that management forecasted during its fourth-quarter earnings release for last fiscal year.FedEx vs. UPSIn recent years, FedEx has gone through quite a growth spurt. As the economy has recovered from the last great recession, sales have soared, climbing 31% from $34.73 billion to $45.57 billion between its 2010 and 2014 fiscal years. Most of this increase, from a dollar perspective, has come from the business's FedEx Express segment, which saw revenue climb 26% from $21.56 billion to $27.12 billion, but the fastest-growing segments were the business's FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments. During the past five years, revenue at the company's FedEx Freight segment rose 34% from $4.32 billion to $5.78 billion while its FedEx Ground segment skyrocketed 56% from $7.44 billion to $11.62 billion.FDX Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsOver this timeframe, UPS also did well, but not quite as well, as its smaller rival. During the past five years, revenue at the world's largest logistics company rose 22% from $45.30 billion to $55.44 billion. Most of this increase took place in the company's U.S. Domestic Package segment, which rose 21% from $28.16 billion to $34.07 billion, but its fastest-growing area of operations was its International Package segment, which soared 28% from $9.70 billion to $12.43 billion.Although FedEx trumps UPS from the sales side of things, the same cannot be said when it comes to earnings. Over the past five years, FedEx's net income rose 77% from $1.19 billion to $2.10 billion as higher revenue was accompanied by some areas of margin improvement, primarily in its selling, general and administrative expenses, which dropped from 47.2% of sales to 42.1%.FDX Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsAs impressive as this is, however, UPS has done far better during this timeframe. Over the past five years, the logistics giant has seen its net income shoot up 122% from $1.97 billion to $4.37 billion. In addition to benefiting from higher revenue, the business was positively impacted by cost reductions just like FedEx was. According to its most recent annual report, most of this drop in costs came from the business's compensation and benefits expense, which plummeted from 57.3% of sales to 51.5%.TakeawayCurrently, investors seem very enthusiastic about FedEx and for good reason. In addition, analysts and management alike having high expectations for the company for its 2015 fiscal year, the company has demonstrated an ability to grow at a nice clip in the long run. For investors looking for a company that can gobble away market share from its competitors, FedEx might be a great place to start analyzing, but for those more interested in margin improvement, UPS seems to be a more attractive prospect."

The organization is structured in a unique way - FedEx companies attempt to compete collectively in the marketplace while largely operating independently under the respected FedEx brand.Understanding FedEx's operating segments sheds light on the company's important growth and profitability drivers. Thus, I've built a revenue forecast on an operating segment basis for FedEx:The company's operating segments are as follows:ProfitabilityFedEx generated over $3.4 billion of operating income in fiscal year end (FYE) 2014. Earnings growth of 7.3% in FYE 2014 outpaced revenue growth of 2.9%. Operating income margin improved as well, growing from 7.3% in FYE 2013 to 7.6% in FYE 2014. FedEx should continue to realize margin expansion as it benefits from favorable shifts in sales mix. In FYE 2014, operating income by revenue segment was as follows:As depicted in the sales segment analysis in the LR model, FedEx Ground is also the fastest growing segment for the company. FedEx Ground has grown at a 3-year compound annual growth rate of 11.0%, versus 3.3% and 5.4% for FedEx Express and FedEx Freight respectively.DCF Valuation ModelThese revenue and profitability growth drivers are reflected below in the Levered Returns discounted cash flow analysis model to determine an Enterprise Value. I then deduct net debt to conclude the total equity value and resulting per share value for the company:Other Key AssumptionsCapital Expenditures: FedEx has historically spent between 7.5% to 9.5% of sales on capital expenditures. I've selected 8.0%, which is consistent with the 10-year average capital expenditures as a percent of sales.Working Capital: To estimate FedEx's yearly working capital requirements, I analyzed the working capital accounts over the last four quarters: Source: SEC FilingsDiscount Rate: To estimate the discount rate for FedEx, I used the Levered Returns discount rate model, which you can assess below:ConclusionAs the DCF analysis implies, FedEx from a valuation perspective looks interesting here with a fair value price target of $183. FedEx is currently trading at an Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV / EBITDA) multiple of 7.8x and forward P/E multiple of 17.50x, both at discounts to United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) which is currently trading at 11.3x EV / EBITDA and 19.59x P/E. Even at $183, FedEx would still only trade at 9.3x EV / EBITDA ($55,812 / $6,033). Recently though, FedEx stock has made a 9.5% run up since June 16, 2014 to $153.61 at July 6th.

2290453,66533,2014-06-27T14:55:44-04:00,FedEx is trading at multi-year highs due to upbeat economic condition.Rising fuel prices and falling freight rates are some of the challenges the company is facing.We believe that the company has the ability to counter the challenges and the stock will scale higher.,"The share price of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has recorded an all-time high in 2013 after many years with the company's ground and freight operations seeing robust growth. Last year, FedEx announced a record share repurchase program when its board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 32 million of shares. In January this year, the company sold $2 billion in bonds to fund the share repurchase program.FDX data by YCharts  The freight forwarding and logistics industry continues to be a growth industry due to improving macroeconomic conditions worldwide. In this light, we believe that FedEx, the industry leader, will continue to grow steadily in the months and years to come. The company's stock is expected to rise further and outperform the overall stock market.Economy Projected to Improve Further: Positive for FedExThe IMF has projected that global growth will be around 3.7% this year, rising to 3.9% in 2015. Growth in the U.S. is expected to be 2.8% this year and 3% in 2015. Growth in the euro zone is projected to be 1% in 2014 and 1.4% in 2015, although the recovery is expected to be uneven there.Based on the economic outlook, FedEx projected that its FY2015 EPS will be between $8.50 and $9, adjusted for an approximately $0.45 benefit from share repurchases. The company is currently trading at a one-year forward P/E of roughly 17x. Since the beginning of 2011, the company's EPS has grown 63.44% in absolute terms, which represents a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe that the company's FY2016 EPS will be in the range of $10 - $10.50. FDX is trading at a two-year forward P/E of less than 15x, which is certainly an attractive valuation given the company's growth prospects.FDX EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts  Challenges before the CompanyOne of the key challenges for the company in order to maintain consistent revenue growth and profitability is to keep the bargaining power with its shippers in its favor. With trade routes becoming more competitive due to continuously falling freight rates, FedEx's bargaining power with shippers could be negatively impacted. However, we believe that the company has the ability to counter this by executing its balance sheet strength. We expect that FedEx will acquire niche players in important trade routes as and when needed to counter this challenge.Rising oil price is another challenge for the company, which could negatively impact its stable operating margin. Currently FedEx's operating margin is hovering around 7%. It remains to be seen how the company maintains the current operating margin if oil price rises further.FDX Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts  If price of oil continues to rise, we believe that FedEx will unveil a cost-cutting program similar to the one it unveiled in October, when unseasonably harsh winter weather caused the company to lose customers. At that time, customers were moving away from the company to cheaper options. In order to counter that, FedEx said that it would start a pricing policy based on parcel size, instead of weight alone, to reduce the cost of ground delivery. We believe that the company has lots of weapons in its arsenal to counter rising fuel price.ConclusionWe believe that FedEx is an excellent stock for the long haul. It's a solid play on macroeconomic recovery. Our one-year price target for the stock is $175, based on 17x FY2016 estimated earnings.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a BB Research stock analyst.

However, given the huge momentum and fair valuation ahead, shares offer no compelling value in my opinion.Fourth Quarter HighlightsFedEx reported fourth quarter revenues of $11.84 billion, which is up 4% compared to last year. Revenues came in way ahead of consensus estimates at $11.66 billion.Reported net earnings were up by an impressive 141% to $730 million. As a result of share repurchases, earnings per share rose by an even more impressive 159% to $2.46 per share. Earnings came in 10 cents ahead of consensus estimates.Looking Into The ResultsThe company's main express unit reported flat revenues which came in at $7.00 billion. Revenue growth was driven by an 8% jump in ground revenues which came in at $3.01 billion, while freight revenues were up by 12% to $1.55 billion. The service segment posted a modest 1% drop in sales to $402 million.Despite the topline increase in sales, total operating expenses were down by 3%. Salaries and compensation fell by a percent to $4.16 billion while the fuel bill came in unchanged at $1.15 billion.As a result, operating earnings jumped from just 4.4% to 10.0% of sales. Express reported operating earnings of $475 million compared to a breakeven result last year, making it the big earnings driver on the back of cost savings. Ground earnings rose by 26% to $586 million resulting in very impressive margins. Freight earnings more than tripled to $122 million.Valuing FedExThe company ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt including lease obligations came in at $5.5 billion resulting in a modest $2.6 billion net debt position.For the entire year, FedEx reported revenues of $45.6 billion on which it reported net earnings of $2.1 billion. Trading at $147 per share, equity in the business is valued at $43.5 billion. This values equity at a little less than 1.0 times annual revenues and 20-21 times annual earnings.FedEx has raised its quarterly dividend by a third to $0.20 per share, providing investors with an 0.5% dividend yield.Recent Investor PresentationBack in April, FedEx released a big investor presentation. The company stresses the bundled services including the express business, the ground business, its freight unit and services which operate independently, while being managed together. In this manner, FedEx hopes to get the best of both worlds.For the long term it aims operating margins to come in above 10%. Note that operating margins came in at exactly 10.0% over the past quarter.Earnings per share are targeted to grow at 10-15% per annum with improved cash flows targeted to be returned to shareholders. Underlying expected growth is the continued trend of e-commerce growth and globalization. Key for future earnings growth is the continued restructuring plan to improve express earnings by $1.6 billion by 2016.Takeaway For InvestorsThe recovery in the economy, continued growth of e-commerce and the fruits of the turnaround plan in its express business are paying off. This is marked by a substantial dividend hike, although the yield remains very modest.More importantly, for the current year FedEx foresees earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share. This implies that earnings are anticipated to increase toward $2.6 billion, valuing shares at 16-17 times forward earnings. Investors have anticipated this already to a large degree after shares have risen nearly 50% over the past year. Analysts were looking for annual earnings of $8.76 per share.The company continues to be upbeat about the US and global economy, anticipating an acceleration in growth in 2015 versus 2014. Investors are very pleased with the announcement sending shares a full five percent higher. This is as the second largest transportation firm is still recovering from the harsh winter weather in the US.That being said, I believe a lot of the good news has already been priced in, limiting appeal of shares at the moment and at current levels. I will keep the company on my radar in order to initiate a position on significant potential pullbacks around $125 per share. For now I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company operates in four divisions: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services. FedEx and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) are the two largest global courier services in the world and dominant players in the U.S.FedEx shares have put up a good show over the last year; however, the company now needs to deliver. FedEx delivered significant value to investors in the past 12 months. While earnings grew by only 8%, shares increased by more than 50% over the last year. Up until now, in the FedEx bull vs. bear debate, the burden of proof fell on the bears to justify why consensus expectations for 30% EPS growth in FY15 were overly optimistic. However, following the impressive quarterly results and management's bullish guidance, the burden of proof now shifts to the bulls to prove that aggressive growth targets are achievable.Double Digit Growth In The Reported MarginsThe Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx recently reported strong quarterly results. The company reported 1Q14 revenue of $11.84 billion, a year-over-year (""Y/Y"") increase of 4% and better than consensus estimates of $11.66 billion. The company's earnings per share of $2.46 also came in better than consensus estimates of $2.36. The combined effect of the 3% decline in operating expenses and increase in prices of products and services resulted in a huge jump in operating margins, which increased from 4.4% to 10%.The company reported an increase of 8% (from 4.25 million to 4.60 million packages) in average daily package volume for the FedEx Ground. The increase was primarily because of increased orders shipped for the online merchants because of the underlying growth in e-commerce. While the company's other division - FedEx Smart post, reported a decline of 8% from 2.08 million to 1.92 million packages.10%-15% Per Annum Growth TargetFedEx is targeting annual earnings per share growth of 10%-15% with improved cash flows to be returned to shareholders. The company expects its FY15 EPS to be in the range of $8.50-$9.00, which at mid-points represent an impressive Y/Y growth of 29%. This growth in EPS is supported by a number of initiatives the company has launched in Express, solid growth in Ground and Freight, and meaningful accretion from its share buyback.I think the company can achieve the high-end of this target, particularly if the positive fundamentals, including higher weight/package, product mix stabilization and improving yields, experienced in the most recent quarter persist. While I think FedEx's target is realistic and achievable, it is important to mention here that for a company like FedEx certain variables such as global trade growth, volatility in fuel prices, pension returns on assets and discount rates, and weather can result in meaningful swings in earnings.A Detailed Look at the FinancialsThe 4% Y/Y revenue growth was mainly driven by the 8% increase in ground revenues which came in at $3.1 billion, 12% increase in freight revenues which were $1.55 billion, and a modest decline of 1% in sales ($402 million) reported by the service segment. The company's results from the Freight division were particularly stronger than expected. For FY15, revenue and earnings growth is anticipated from ongoing improvements in all transportation segments with moderate global economic growth driving volume and yield increases.FDX reported flat revenue of $7 billion from the main express unit. The company's express division is reporting underperforming growth and lack of margin expansion for several years. The company expects both the revenues and earnings to increase during the FY15 owing to improved U.S. domestic and international yields and as the company remains focused on revenue quality and its yield. The company needs to focus on a continued restructuring plan to improve its express earnings targeted to be $1.6 billion by 2016.A Considerable 20% Increase In CapexFedEx has increased its capex expectations by approx. 20% from FY14 levels to $4.2 billion in 2015, primarily driven by aircraft fleet modernization, investments in its Ground network, and partially because of few projects that FDX decided to defer into FY15.Share Repurchase Program Near CompletionFedEx repurchased 9.9 million shares during the last quarter, bringing the aggregate shares repurchased for fiscal year to 36.8 million. Moreover, the company has 5.3 million shares left under its current share repurchase authorization and expects to complete the program by the end of 2014. Although the share repurchase program would increase the shareholder value, it could also weigh on company's free cash flow generation and hence future returns to shareholders.ConclusionFedEx pleasantly surprised the market with its fourth-quarter results coming in better than expectations. The company is continuing its efforts to grow itself and cost cutting exercises are yielding results. The recovery in the U.S. and global economy, continued growth of e-commerce, and the fruits of the turnaround plan in its express business are paying off.The situation is further marked by a substantial dividend hike, although the dividend yield remains modest. However, I think all these positive points are already priced in the stock (share price rose over 50% during the last year) and there is little upside potential. FedEx has set itself optimistic targets (earnings growth and cost savings) and until there is greater visibility on the achievability of these targets in FY15, shares of the company may remain range-bound. For investors bullish on macro, FedEx still has plenty of cyclical leverage and the stock should start working again at the first sign of a pickup in air freight, but for now I prefer to remain on the sidelines. I prefer UPS and will follow up with an article on the company soon.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2272813,23625,2014-06-17T12:56:42-04:00,"Last quarter FedEx disappointed investors by reporting lower than expected revenue and earnings, missing the Wall Street earnings consensus by over 25 cents per share.This quarter Wall Street is expecting FedEx to step up its profitability and increase earnings per share by over 10%.However, some investors are not quite as bullish in their bottom line expectations as the Street is for Wednesday's report.","FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings before the market opens on Wednesday, June 18th. FedEx is one of the largest courier and delivery service companies in the United States. Last quarter FedEx disappointed investors by reporting lower than expected revenue and earnings, missing the Wall Street earnings consensus by more than 25 cents per share. This quarter Wall Street is expecting FedEx to step up its profitability and increase earnings per share by more than 10%. However, investors are not quite as bullish in their bottom line expectations as the Street is on Wednesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for FedEx)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for FedEx to report $2.36 EPS and $11.617B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 18 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $2.31 EPS and $11.659B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting FedEx to miss the Wall Street earnings consensus by 5 cents per share while outperforming the Street's revenue projection by $42 million.Over the previous six quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting FedEx's EPS and revenue 2 and 4 times, respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. Here we are seeing an average differential between the two groups' expectations.The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from $2.15 to $2.37 per share and from $11.520B to $11.855B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a wider range of estimates on FedEx's earnings.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wide range of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.Over the past three months Wall Street increased its EPS consensus from $2.32 to $2.36 while the Estimize consensus fell throughout the period from $2.34 to $2.31. Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast decreased from $11.720B to $11.617B while the Estimize sales consensus declined from $11.754B to $11.659B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and the directionality of analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a leading indicator. Here we see the Estimize consensus dropping before the report.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is nano who projects $2.33 EPS and $11.648B in revenue. nano is ranked 245th overall among over 4,500 contributing analysts. This season nano has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 47% and 50% of the time, respectively, throughout 36 estimates.Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case nano is expecting FedEx to report between the expectations of Wall Street and Estimize, beating the Estimize consensus on earnings, but missing on revenue.This quarter FedEx doesn't have the poor weather excuse to lean on and Wall Street has set its year-over-year profit growth target high at over 10%. Contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform seem to have taken notice of FedEx's two quarters in a row of misses on the bottom line and are expecting FedEx to miss the Wall Street earnings consensus again on Wednesday while bringing in slightly better than expected revenue.Disclosure: None."
2386895,42201,2014-08-06T04:58:46-04:00,"Low dividend means this is not a great stock for those needing immediate income, but for investors with a longer horizon, an investment in FDX could prove very profitable.The company has bought back $4.3 billion worth of its own stock, boosting EPS by lowering the number of shares.Still, there's a huge amount of cash left on FDX's balance sheet.Forward p/e ratio stands at only 16.8.","When I recommended FedEx (NYSE:FDX) in September of 2013, it was trading at $114.90 per share. Today, shares are trading at $148.06, an increase of 28.91%, more than double that of the S&P500, which has gone up by 13.74%. Despite the amazing appreciation in price per share, the dividend yield is now actually slightly higher than it was 11 months ago. At the current rate of $0.54 per quarter, the dividend yield stands at 0.54% annually.FDX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsFedEx has seen its revenue increase by an average of 5.12% over the past 5 years, reaching $45.56 billion in the most recent fiscal year. At a market cap of $42.28 billion, this means the company is trading at a price to sales ratio of 0.9, slightly above the 5 year average of 0.8 but well below United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) p/s ratio of 1.6. For the current fiscal year, analysts expect FedEx to have revenues of $47.69 billion, which would be an increase of 4.68%.FDX EPS Basic (3 Year Growth) data by YChartsFedEx has a 3 year EPS growth rate of 13.94%, slightly above the 11.44% average of its largest competitor. Last year's earnings per share were $6.75, giving the company a price to earnings ratio of 22.0, which is quite high, especially considering the fact you can get UPS for only 21.3 times last year's earnings. However, FDX' earnings per share are expected to reach $8.81 in the current fiscal year, giving the company a forward p/e ratio of only 16.8.FDX Dividend Per Share (5 Year Growth) data by YChartsFedEx may have a very low dividend yield, but with a payout ratio of only 8.92% in the most recent 4 quarters, there's plenty of room for growth left. The dividend has grown by an average of 6.40% over the past 5 years and with earnings expected to go up by 30.5% in the current fiscal year, I wouldn't be surprised to see the dividend get raised to $0.25 or even higher.FedEx has a very good looking balance sheet, with $2.91 billion in cash and equivalents. With 285 million shares currently outstanding, the company has over $10 per share in cash. This gives FDX a lot of opportunities to return some capital to its shareholders, either by issuing a special dividend or by repurchasing more shares. Over the past 12 months FDX has already spent $4.3 billion on buybacks, lowering the number of outstanding shares and thus increasing EPS. UPS only bought back $3.1 billion of its own shares, despite having a market cap more than twice that of FDXFDX Stock Buybacks (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsFedEx isn't a stock for investors who need income from dividends right away. However, as the company increases EPS, I would expect it to continue its dividend growth and for those with a longer investment horizon, it might be a very interesting stock. The stock has already gone up quite a lot but large stock buybacks and income growth are increasing EPS at such a rate that the forward p/e ratio is still very reasonable. FedEx has an extremely low payout ratio which means the company can increase the dividend at a higher pace than the EPS growth rate.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The Street was expecting $11.66 billion in revenue resulting in $2.36 eps. FedEx reported well above those levels with $11.8 billion in revenue and $2.46 eps. This release marks a significant improvement from last year's fourth quarter earnings of $2.13 per share when one time charges were excluded. Further, CEO Fred Smith opined his optimism for the future in the release:Source: Q4 Earnings ReleaseMoreover, FedEx's operating margin grew to 10% from 9.6% in the same period last year (on a non-GAAP basis). The business fundamentals are improving as revenue growth was coupled with margin improvement to drive net income growth. Management is also creating shareholder value by buying back shares and expanding the dividend.On June 9th, FedEx declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a $0.05 per share increase from the prior quarter's dividend. To receive this dividend, inventors must be stockholders of record at the close of business tomorrow. Investors are also benefiting from a shrinking number of shares outstanding. During the fourth quarter, FedEx acquired 9.9 million shares, increasing the fiscal 2014 purchase total to 36.8 million shares. As of May 31, 2014, the company still had 5.3 million shares remaining under the existing repurchase authorizations.Future OutlookManagement has given a positive outlook in its guidance. For fiscal 2015, management projected earnings to be $8.50 to $9.00 per share. SG&A costs should be reduced as its voluntary buyout program departures were completed this year. The company will also become more efficient from a modernization of the company's aircraft fleet. Upgrading to new B767 planes represents a 30% reduction in operating costs compared to its current MD10-30 planes. The company expects capital spending to increase to $4.2 billion, a large portion will be dedicated to these new planes.FedEx is not merely just focusing on improving its current business operations, but is also in an expanding. On May 1, 2014, Express completed the acquisition of Supaswift businesses in South Africa and six other countries: Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zambia. The acquisition of Supaswift will increase FedEx's capabilities in one of the world's most rapidly developing regions and offer tremendous opportunities for both local and international customers to access new markets.Final RemarksFedEx's business fundamentals are improving and its future outlook is bright. Management is undoubtedly creating shareholder value and a long-term investor will benefit from a share buyback program and increasing dividend. FedEx is a stable company that can be a cornerstone of a long-term portfolio.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The Street estimate is $2.36.Revenues: Expectations are for an increase of 2.0% y/y to $11.66 bln.","By Craig BowlesOverviewFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is slated to report 4Q 2014 earnings before the bell on Wednesday, June 18th. The earnings release is expected at approximately 7:30 a.m. EST with an 8:30 a.m. earnings conference call webcast available at FedEx Investor Relations. Results from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx has retested December's all-time highs following 2013's 50% advance. 2013's move up was similar to the first move of 50 points out of the great recession. Those 2013 highs and more recently June's first half are now acting as a resistance area above $140. Historically, the stock has tested below the 200-Day MA soon after sharp advances, so a retest would seem likely by October. That being said, consolidative support appears strong below $136 down to $130 with limited resistance for higher prices. Above $135 encourages optimism. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx is supporting their stock with a massive buyback and insiders took advantage and sold the all-time highs. Now enters Warren Buffett's buying. Both UPS and FedEx have moved higher since the lousy UPS earnings report and are testing December highs. Traders don't expect much for this earnings report, so an earnings miss of a few cents wouldn't be surprising as long as revenue comes in closer to $11.7 bln with a decent outlook for 2015. The biggest worry is the stock had quite an advance last year and still hasn't had its historically normal healthy pullback.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

We have one account with a cost basis on FDX of $36.85 from March 2000.You have to think about the iconic transport company and brand over two time frames:1.) Near-term, with the results being driven by the share repo and the restructuring of the company;and2.) The longer-term time frame, as Express volumes continue to shrink and more importantly the cost structure of FDX's Express business is adjusted to reflect lower volumes;Last quarter was a sizable EPS and revenue miss for FDX even though revenue grew 3% y/y, operating income grew 9%, and EPS grew 9%. Weather was thought to have cost FDX about $0.25 per share in q3 '14.During the q3 '14 conference call, FDX management cut the fiscal '14 guidance to 5%-9% EPS growth due to the q2 '13 and q3 '14 weather.As it stands right now, FDX will grow revenue and EPS for the full year ended May 31, '14 at 2.5% and 7%, respectively.Fiscal '15 revenue and EPS are expected to grow y/y at 5% and 31% respectively.Of the 31% expected EPS growth in fiscal 2015 (begins June 1, 2014), it looks like about half of the share repurchases will occur in fiscal '15, resulting in 8% of the 31% of expected growth being due to the share repo.FDX originally set out to repo 32 million shares or roughly 10% of their fully-diluted shares outstanding when they made the share repo announcement in October '13, and by q3 '14 management had repo'ed about 17 million of the 32 million total. However, they didn't get the full benefit of the repo, since the jump in the stock price caused some unexpected stock option exercises or what I would think was unanticipated dilution.When FDX made the share repo announcement, there were 319 million fully-diluted shares outstanding, and even though there has been 17 million shares repo'ed (per the FDX March '14 earnings call), as of the February '14 quarter, there were 307 million fully-diluted shares outstanding. Mathematically, there should have been 302 million shares outstanding (319 - 17 million repo'ed = 302 million should have been remaining). 5 million shares materialized (I suspect) from exercise of stock options that were out of the money and maybe were expected to expire worthless, and didn't.The point being (sorry, I had to take readers through the math to be sure I understood it), is that in fiscal '15 about 7%-8% of the expected 31% EPS growth will be due to lower share count, or roughly 25% of 2015's expected full-year earnings growth as the 32 million share repurchase program ends.Longer-term, even as management downsizes Express, Express has been a pleasant surprise the last two quarters: per our spreadsheet notes, Express margins rose 130 bps in q2 '14, and then again in q3 '14 (last quarter) Express, as Express volumes, particularly Domestic volumes, continued to be negative in the low single digits.By segment, FedEx Express is 59% of FDX's total revenue as of last quarter, and 20% of total operating income.By contrast, FedEx Ground is 27% of FDX's total revenue as of last quarter, but 74% of FDX's total operating income.Ground is the star right now for FDX, as the Ground segment has better margins and faster growth.Express is being pressured as more commercial airlines move freight in commercial airliner underbellies, as Fred Smith detailed in the March '14 conference call.Valuation: Expected EPS growth for fiscal years 2014 to 2016 are 7%, 33% and 21% respectively, while expected revenue for the next two years is 2%, 5%, and 6% respectively. (Fiscal '14 is over, so we are really clued in on the 2015 and 2016 estimates.)At $140 per share, FDX is trading at 21(x), 15(x) and 13(x) the next three years' consensus estimates, so on a PEG basis, FDX is cheap. To pay 15(x) fiscal 2015's consensus EPS of $8.84, which is 33% growth from the expected 2014 EPS of $6.67, is pretty reasonable.But that is about where the valuation attraction ends: FDX is trading at 1(x) 4-quarter trailing revenues, 10(x) cash-flow and 39(x) free-cash-flow.FDX is returning 393% of its free-cash-flow to shareholders primarily in the form of the share repurchase, although there is a small dividend, as long-term debt has increased to fund part of the share repurchase.Debt to total capital has risen from 10% to 24% in the last 8 quarters.To be frank, given FDX's capital intensity, operating leverage, and free-cash-flow generation, I'm amazed they committed to a 10% share repo program at all. There are many companies with less leveraged business models and more free-cash-flow that could do this size of a share repo, but don't.Our internal valuation model has given us widely divergent estimated intrinsic value estimates for FDX over the last 5 years, given the operating leverage and capital intensity of the business. If we use an 18 quarter average intrinsic value estimate for FDX, it is exactly $140 per share (I kid you not) which is where the stock closed Friday, June 13th.Morningstar has an intrinsic value estimate on FDX of $146 per share.From our valuation models, FDX seems pretty fairly valued at current levels.Technically, we would only buy the shares if FDX fell to the $120 area, which is a price level that represents a series of highs from early 2006 through mid-2007, before the stock fell apart.The stock is overbought on the daily, weekly and monthly charts.We have no plans to add or subtract to the current position.The stock tends to run when the economy is on the upswing, volumes are improving and the price of crude oil is stable to falling, which allows the fuel surcharge to fatten the margins.Talk of $120-$150 crude oil if Iraq falls would not be a near-term positive for FDX.From a competitive analysis position, FDX Ground is pushing UPS even though the price competition is still thought to be rational. Both companies can maintain their yields and profit margins, without getting stupid about market share. Having DHL vacate the US market (or at least my impression was DHL pulled back from the US market), helped maintain margins and competitive positions.FDX's q4 '14 should see a bounce back from q3 '14 and the weather issue. 2015 guidance should be around 5% revenue growth and 33% EPS growth.We think the stock is fairly valued, although there have been a number of high-profile investors and activist hedge funds sniffing around the stock. We have followed the company for 15 years, and I just am not sure how much value there is left to unlock.Here is our March '14 article on FDX, and here last Sept '13.Disclosure: The author is long FDX.

2106883,21798,2014-03-25T06:19:16-04:00,FedEx took an expected hit to earnings as a result of the severe winter weather.Stable fuel prices and share buybacks should help to put a floor under the stock price.The outlook for the future still looks positive as earnings growth looks strong over the long-term.,"The effect of an above average season of winter storms did have a negative effect on F3Q2014 earnings for FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX). The company missed its revenue estimate by $160 million and missed its earnings estimate by 23 cents per share. Despite the miss, revenue of $11.3 billion increased 3.2% year-over-year and EPS of $1.23 increased 9% year-over-year. This shows that the weather had a negative effect, but not a devastating one for the company. Overall, FedEx still looks like a strong investment for the long-term.The FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight segments were strong in F3Q2014 with revenue gains of 10% and 9% respectively. However, revenue for FedEx Express was flat for the quarter due to lower freight revenue and lower fuel surcharges.Stable fuel prices are likely to benefit FedEx for 2014 and 2015. Eia.gov expects the average price of retail gasoline to be $3.44 in 2014 and $3.36 in 2015. This should keep costs under control and allow for positive earnings growth.FedEx authorized a share repurchase program last quarter to the tune of 32 million shares. This should help contribute to a boost in earnings per share and lay a solid foundation for the stock to move higher. As of February 28, 2014, FedEx had 15.2 million shares remaining in the plan.The company generated a healthy cash flow of $4.3 billion for the past twelve months with $968 million left as free cash flow. The balance sheet is solid as FedEx has nearly 2 times more current assets than current liabilities. There are also over 2 times more total assets than total liabilities.ValuationFedEx looks fairly valued as it's trading at about 15 times expected 2015 EPS of $8.84. This fair valuation is reinforced by a PEG of 1.32 and a price-to-book ratio of 2.65. Competitor, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is trading with a higher valuation. UPS has a forward P/E of 16, a PEG of 1.7, and a price-to-book ratio of 13.8. FedEx's EV/EBITDA of 7.1 is also lower than UPS's figure of 10.7. Overall, FedEx has a fair price, but is priced more attractively than its main competitor.The RisksOne troubling factor for FedEx is the lower growth for the Express segment as compared to the Ground & Freight segments. Customers have been using more of the lower-priced services than the Express services. The company has implemented a profit improvement program which is focused on FedEx Express and FedEx Services. However, most of the benefits of this program will not be realized until 2015 and 2016. The success of the program depends on the health of the economy. So, if the economy continues to improve over the next few years, the Express segment is likely to experience increases again. If the economy hits a rough patch, then the Express segment is likely to show weakness.ConclusionFedEx is expected to grow earnings at 15% annually for the next five years. This is expected to come from 2% - 4% annual revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and share buybacks. The stock is priced better than UPS, but fairly valued as compared to the S&P 500. The stock should perform well along with the improving economy. Since FedEx's expected earnings growth is higher than that of the average S&P 500 company, I think that FedEx will outperform the index over the next few years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2093973,23479,2014-03-17T21:26:43-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is set to release its third quarter (fiscal year ending May) earnings on March 19, 2014. In the previous quarter, FedEx posted revenue growth of 3% driven by the growing volumes at its Ground segment. Net profits improved 14% driven by profitability improvements such as the shift to fuel efficient aircraft’s and lower pension expenses. In the third quarter, we expect to see gains in FedEx’s Ground segment driven by the holiday season deliveries. However, similar to UPS, catering to the higher-than-expected deliveries must have resulted in higher costs as well.Revenues for FedEx’s Express segment have felt the pressure from a shift in customers' preference towards slower but economical shipment options. This has led to declines in revenue and volumes for FedEx’s pricier yet time efficient services. In order to offset the decline in these premium services, FedEx’s Express segment will be highly dependent on yields, or revenue per package.Ground Segment May See Increase In RevenuesFedEx’s ground segment, which deals with domestic package delivery at lower prices, posted a 10% growth in revenues in the second quarter of FY 2014, driven by customers' shift towards economical package delivery services rather than pricier yet time efficient services. The holiday season and online shopping sales in November also had a positive impact.In the third quarter, we expect FedEx’s ground segment to benefit from the sales during the December holiday season. Additionally, the sales from Cyber Monday will also add to the segment’s revenue in the third quarter. The majority of these sales can be attributed to an increase in online shopping. The segment also stands to benefit from the increase in FedEx’s shipping rates by an average of 4.9%, which came into effect from January 6.A matter of concern for FedEx’s ground segment will be the higher costs that it might have incurred in order to cater to the overwhelming number of deliveries during the holiday season. UPS had to increase its temporary staff by 30,000 and increase purchased transportation in order to manage the deliveries, leading to higher costs and lower net profits. Bad weather during the holiday season would have also added to the difficulties faced by logistical services providers. Higher costs will have a negative impact on FedEx’s margins and bottom line. However, in anticipation of high volume of packages during the holiday season, FedEx had already undertaken many of the expansion and maintenance activities in the second quarter. This might ease off some pressure on margins in the third quarter since a portion of the costs had already been incurred in the previous quarter.Express Segment Revenues May Be Impacted By Change in Customer PreferenceFedEx’s Express segment has been facing headwinds due to the increasing shift of customers towards economical package delivery options and the move away from time efficient alternatives. This leads to a shift in revenues from FedEx’s pricier yet time efficient service offerings from International Priority to economical options like International Economy. This is also evidenced by a 10% increase in International Economy volumes and revenues in the second quarter of FY 2014, whereas International Priority revenues and volumes declined 2% and 5%, respectively. The trends from the previous quarter are expected to continue leading to growth in volumes for FedEx’s International Economy service as volumes move away from International Priority. Yields, or revenue per package, will play a major role in determining the whether the segment’s revenues will rise or decline.We will be revising our price estimate of $139 for FedEx after the company files its results with the SEC.Disclosure: No positions."

The results weren't as bad, although they did fail to reach expectations.Expansion abroad is likely to bring some top line growth as the company acquires customers from Japan, Spain, and their surrounding markets.The company is taking cost cutting seriously by replacing planes and laying off staff.Cost cutting measures and international expansion along with the fact that winter is over will help fight low yields and lead to share price growth.","Logistics expert FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) reported its third quarter yesterday which to some came as a bad news since the company missed expectations. The stock price is down 3.75% year to date. The reason behind the decline was the severe winter weather in the US that of all the sectors impacted transportation more than anywhere else.However, despite temporary volatile results FedEx still remains a good company. In this article, we will go through the company's reported performance. We will then have a look at what makes FedEx a good choice to be considered in your portfolio.The QuarterYesterday's reported results included a revenue increase of 3% to $11.3 billion compared to last year's results. Express remained relatively flat as lower freight revenue, fuel surcharges, and the impact from weather offset domestic package volume and revenue per package that slightly increased. Ground deliveries remained strong with average daily volume growing 8% and the company posting 10% growth in the segment's revenue. This was driven by market share gain due the popularity of the FedEx Home Delivery and business to business service.Operating income grew 9% to $641 million that could have been $125 million more had weather not impacted the company's operations. Higher base package yields, lower pension expense, one additional operating day, and ongoing cost reduction activities contributed towards the increase that was partially offset by lower freight revenue, increased network expansion costs, and the negative net impact of fuel.The net result was diluted earnings per share rising to $1.23 reflecting a near 9% jump since the previous year. The company experienced a shifting trend towards more economical choices offered as opposed to priority services and this will now continue to affect operations in the near run. Despite that, this quarter didn't give bad results as we have seen in other companies.FedEx's plan to expand its network globally, running cost cutting measures, and the fact that winter is almost over means that the company will be able to get back to where it was. Let's have a deeper look at these happenings.The FutureGlobal ExpansionSource: PresentationThe internet has led to buyers and sellers coming closer than ever. This is resulting in the growth of door to door shipments of smaller packages and light freight shipments (air express) as cross-border e-commerce activity multiplies (see above chart). While US GDP growth is forecasted to stay at 2.6% and 3% for 2014 and 2015, growing international operations despite some harmful policies are likely to favor the company's expansion abroad.Next month FedEx Express will be opening its North Asia-Pacific regional hub at Kansai International Airport in Osaka acquiring a greater amount of customers in Japan who need access to and from the markets in Asia-Pacific, the US, and Europe. In an arena where profits are still possible by expansion which simultaneously carries with it brand awareness, this is a safe way to generate additional organic returns.Express will also open a new hub station in a call centre in Mexico City this month. The company has reached a milestone under its growth initiative that it started during 2011 by opening its 100th new station in Seville of southern Spain.Expanding Bottom Line Savings will help Retain MarginsWhile yields on this type of commodity traffic have been declining in real terms over 20 years making traditional cargo service profitability challenging, cost cutting measures such as the company's impending $1.6 billion program will allow FedEx to maintain its margins. The program will focus especially on restructuring the Express unit that has been hurt by international concerns and trade down.Source: PresentationSecondly, the company is in the process of changing its fleet to a more fuel efficient operation given the hike in fuel prices (see graph above). FedEx is acquiring more 767 aircrafts than the previously decided 777F aircrafts. The 767 provides a $10 million annual positive impact to the P&L despite the higher depreciation. So this change will add another source of value to profits.Other efforts include laying-off staff. At the beginning of March, about 75% of the 3,600 employees accepted voluntary buyouts and vacated their positions. The remaining 25% will depart by May this year. The third quarter results included benefits from this voluntary severance program and additional benefits will continue as the fiscal year progresses.Bottom LineSource: MorningstarDespite the slowing market, FedEx has experienced revenue growth of 8.4% as its 3 year average was higher than the industry's 5.7%. Similar momentum has followed the net income that has also grown at 9.7%. All of this has happened at a debt to equity of 0.2 while the industry runs at 0.6. This leaves us with one thing: whatever happens to the industry, FedEx has managed to outperform competitors like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).UPS already faced bad publicity last Christmas when it failed to deliver orders. Nothing as such has happened with FedEx. With winter ending, the company will be able to get back on track. While strong returns are a little ways away, FedEx will offer them at some point. Therefore, I give the company a buy rating.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2146193,24491,2014-04-17T03:57:39-04:00,"We don't think the new money finds FedEx that attractive. Let's find out why.FedEx posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 4, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals.We prefer more timely ideas for consideration, ones with Valuentum Buying Index ratings of 9 or 10.","As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. Let's examine what we think FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is worth in this article and whether shares are timely for new money.But first, a little background about us to help with the understanding of this article. At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies (good value, good momentum, etc.), thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below). More interest by a wide variety of investors --> more buying --> increased likelihood of price to fair value convergence.At the core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash-flow basis and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. For relative valuation purposes, we compare FedEx to peers CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW), Uti Worldwide (NASDAQ:UTIW), and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). We understand the pitfalls of relative valuation analysis, which is why we combine the relative valuation process with a rigorous discounted cash-flow exercise. We like to take a holistic view.FedEx posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 4 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. To us, we think the new money doesn't find FedEx that attractive (on the basis of this rating). We prefer firms with higher Valuentum Buying Index ratings - firms that register a 9 or 10. These companies are not only underpriced on both a discounted cash flow and relative valuation basis but also are exhibiting strong technical and momentum indicators.Our Report on FedExInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 12.2% during the past three years.• FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services• FedEx's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• FedEx's long-term financial goals are as follows: 1) achieve 10% operating margin; 2) increase EPS 10%-15% per year; 3) grow profitable revenue; 4) improve cash flows; 5) increase ROIC; 6) and increase the dividend. We like management's focus.• Global trade growth and e-commerce continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 54% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 42% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx's shares are worth between $96-$160 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. In many cases, we think the wider the margin of safety, the wiser the investor. The estimated fair value of $128 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.4 times last year's EBITDA. Shares of FedEx are trading at more than $130 per share at the time of this writing. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.3%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $128 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $96 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $160 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $128 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $172 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $128 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score, as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2095833,23625,2014-03-18T13:34:42-04:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) is set to report FQ3 2014 earnings before the market opens on Wednesday, March 19th. This December was marked by brutal snowstorms and extremely cold temperatures, which kept shoppers out of retail stores. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) got bombarded during the holiday season and rival UPS (NYSE:UPS) needed to hire 30,000 more temporary workers than expected to keep up with demand. As a result, margins were much thinner and UPS earned $1.25 EPS compared to earlier estimates of $1.43. EPS estimates for FedEx have fallen as well throughout the quarter, but not nearly as sharply as they did for UPS. Here's what investors are expecting from FedEx on Wednesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for FedEx)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for FedEx to report $1.52 EPS and $11.462B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 29 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.55 EPS and $11.490B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting FedEx to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue.Over the past six quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting FedEx's EPS and revenue 3 and 5 times, respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non-professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a moderate difference between the two groups' expectations.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from $1.45 to $1.60 EPS and from $11.334B to $11.605B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing an average sized distribution of estimates on FedEx.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market could mean greater volatility post earnings. Over the past four months, the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from $1.55 to $1.52 while the Estimize consensus slipped from $1.57 to $1.55. Meanwhile, the Wall Street revenue forecast dropped from $11.502B to $11.462B while the Estimize forecast also decreased from a high of $11.529B to $11.490B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bearish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Nils1975 who projects $1.46 EPS and $11.334B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, Nils1975 is rated as the 18th best analyst and is ranked 12th overall among over 3,950 contributing analysts. This season Nils1975 has been more accurate than the Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 64% and 70% of the time, respectively, over 89 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, Nils1975 is making a bearish call expecting FedEx to miss the Estimize community's expectations on both EPS and revenue by a wide margin.This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform are expecting FedEx to beat the Street's forecasts on both the top and bottom line. Costs are expected to be higher this quarter and weigh down FedEx's earnings, but investors still have significantly higher expectations than Wall Street.Disclosure: None."
2093573,32001,2014-03-17T15:32:43-04:00,Share repo is primary stock catalyst but just getting started.FDX is a return to global growth play.Express segment remains a drag on returns.,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports their fiscal Q3 '14 earnings before the bell on Wednesday morning, Match 19th, 2014.Analyst consensus, per Thomson Reuters, is expecting $11.46 billion in revenues and $1.52 in EPS, for expected year-over-year growth of 5% and 37% respectively.Both the revenue and EPS consensus have been trimmed slightly since the last earnings report in December, '13.Last quarter, in a surprise reversal from the last few years, Express actually did pretty well, while the Ground segment didn't do so well. Express margins were up roughly 130 bp's (per our internal spreadsheet) while Ground margins fell roughly 250 bp's. Express Domestic volumes were still slightly negative, while Ground volume rose 8%.Last October '13 FDX announced a 32 million share repurchase program, which amounts to a little more than 10% of the fully diluted shares outstanding at November, '13 of 315 million. Some of the shares could be used to offset dilution since FDX has been downsizing the Express unit and has offered early buyout to a nice chunk of FDX employees, which presumably are both union and management. (You can see this more on the balance sheet where ""pension and PRHC (post retirement healthcare) liabilities"" has fallen from $5.6 billion as of May, 2012 to $3.7 billion as of November, '13.At the time of the share repo announcement, the stock was trading around $111 - $112, but by the end of October had run up to $131.Longer-term, FDX has to continue to shrink Express as the segment has seen gradually declining volumes for years, while FDX continues to grow Ground.Currently Express is roughly 60% of total FDX revenue and 40% of total FDX operating income, while Ground is 30% of total FDX revenue and a little over half of operating income. The Freight business, which has been struggling makes up the difference in FDX's total revenue and operating metrics.What is interesting for me as an investor is that I never would have thought FDX generated enough free-cash-flow to do a buyback of that size, with Baa1 / BBB credit ratings.The reader can quickly see the surge in free-cash-flow with most of it being funded by the decline in capex. This isn't unprecedented for companies to do this: Home Depot (NYSE:HD) did the exact the same thing: dramatically reduced their store openings and plowed the money into share repurchases and dividends.Valuation: FDX is expected to grow EPS 12%, 28% and 21% over the next three fiscal year, 2014,2015, and 2016, while revenue growth is expected to be 3%, 5% and 6% for the same years. That is an average of 20% EPS growth and 5% revenue growth as it stands today.At 19(x) expected 2014 earnings, the stock isn't expensive on a p.e basis.On a cash-flow basis at 9(x) cash-flow and 23(x) free-cash-flow, it isn't as cheap now as it was when we were accumulating the shares, which was closer to 6(x) cash-flow.Here where it gets interesting though: in terms of intrinsic value calculations, our earnings-based model values FDX at a $180 intrinsic value, while Morningstar places a $136 dollar price on fair or intrinsic value. Averaging the two, we get $161.The point is that we using the above range, we are still at the low end of the intrinsic value range.Technicals: looking at the daily and weekly charts, we wouldn't add to current positions until the stock pulled back to the previous all-time-high at $120.A number of hedge funds have now jumped into FDX looking for ""value-creation"". FDX's debt to capital is just 10%. I for one hope FDX doesn't lever up and debt to buy back more stock.To be frank, I was surprised by the share repo announcement in mid-October '13. It puts an onus on FDX to reduce investment (i.e. capex), cut expenses dramatically, or lever up to repo shares.The closer the stock gets to $150 - $160, the more likely we would be to reduce our current 2% position in the stock.Disclosure: I am long FDX, HD.

2060423,56962,2014-03-01T01:07:00-05:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) operates in the integrated shipping and logistics industry providing a range of transportation, e-commerce, and business services. It operates through its four business segments: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services. The company has a long-term bottom-line target to achieve a higher than 10% operating margin and a 10%-15% rise in EPS per year. This is mainly due to the company's target of $1.6 billion in annual profit improvement by the end of FY 2016 mainly from the FedEx Express operating segment.My article will analyze the company's current bottom-line performance and determine actions initiated by the company that will contribute to the operating margin and EPS growth targets in the coming years. To begin, let us analyze the company's current operating margins and EPS performance.Operating Margin and EPS Performance AnalysisSource: Morning StarYou can see from the table above that the company recorded a decline in its operating margin in FY 2013. The FY 2014 TTM operating margin shows a slight recovery due to ongoing initiatives undertaken by the company that I will discuss later on in my article. A similar trend can also be seen with regards to the company's EPS that declined in FY 2013 and is showing recovery in the FY 2014 TTM. The company is so far ahead of its target of 10-15% growth in its EPS for FY 2014. I will now determine how the company is putting its efforts into achieving its long-term target of a more than 10% operating margin.Path to Reach Margin Improvement TargetBusiness Realignment focused on FedEx Express SegmentSource: FDX 10K FilingThe company experienced a more challenging business environment in FY 2013. This included changing trends for FedEx Express as customers shifted from priority to deferred shipping services that impacted the company's profitability materially in FY 2013. Priority freight is a high-margin operation for the company as it satisfies the customers' need for speedy delivery.As a result of these factors, the company announced its profit improvement programs in FY 2013 targeting a profitability improvement of $1.6 billion for FedEx Express by the end of the year 2016 (from full year 2013 base business). This cost reduction initiative is mainly targeted at cost reductions in selling, general, and administrative functions through headcount reductions, rationalization of processes and modernization of the FedEx Express' aircraft fleet.The following chart displays the targeted savings to be made from a broad category of items.Source: FDX PIP PresentationFirst let us have a look at the company's initiative to decrease its SG&A expenses.SG&A Cost ReductionsSource: Yahoo FinanceYou can see from the table above that the SG&A expenses represented 50.22% of the company's consolidated revenue in FY 2013. The company successfully reduced its SG&A expenses to 49.55% as percentage of the company's consolidated revenue.The company has further planned cost reductions in selling, general, and administrative functions through headcount reductions, rationalization of processes and removal of less essential work. FedEx Express employed approximately 160,700 employees by the end of FY 2013.The company completed a voluntary program offering cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees in certain staff functions. Around 3,600 employees left or will be leaving voluntarily by the end of the year 2014. These actions will reduce the company's SG&A expenses (that represent around 50% of the company's revenue) as a percentage of the company's consolidated revenue and in turn will improve the company's overall operating margin.Now, I will determine how the company will save money due to fleet modernization.Fleet ModernizationFleet modernization results in lower aircraft maintenance expenses along with savings from fuel efficiency. The maintenance and repair expenses incurred by the company decreased by 6% in Q2 FY 2014 and by 9% in the Q1 FY 2014 due to continued modernization of the company's aircraft fleet. The FedEx Express global air and ground network is comprised of a fleet of over 640 aircrafts that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories. The table below shows the company's aircraft purchase commitment for the coming years.Source: FDX 10K FilingThese new aircraft models are more economical compared to the older ones the company has as shown through the trip cost comparison chart below.Source: FDX PIP PresentationThe company aims to experience a 20% improvement in trip costs savings from B757 aircraft and a 30% improvement in trip costs saved from B767 aircraft through to FY 2016.The use of newer and more fuel-efficient aircrafts will reduce the company's greenhouse gas emissions and airport noise in addition to saving from jet fuel efficiency as discussed below.Source: FDX 10K FilingYou can see from the table above that the company's jet fuel costs represent 8.3% of the company's consolidated revenue while total fuel expense was 10.7% of the company's consolidated revenue in FY 2013. The company's fuel expense declined by 4.24% in FY 2013 and 5.60% in Q2 of FY 2014.The company is adding more fuel-efficient aircraft to its fleet. The company updated its long-term goal to increase its FedEx Express vehicles' fuel efficiency by 30% by 2020. The company has also established a goal of obtaining 30% of its jet fuel from alternative fuels by the year 2030.The company's electric delivery fleet has grown to 360 low-emission hybrid-electric vehicles and 165 zero emission electric vehicles. In addition to this, the company recently purchased 1,900 lightweight, composite-body Reach vehicles from Utilimaster to add to its 400 Reach vehicles already in operation. This makes the FedEx Express lightweight composite-body vehicle fleet the biggest in the industry. The Reach van is 35% more fuel efficient than conventional vehicles in the FedEx Express fleet.Closing RemarksI am optimistic about the company's bottom line due to the profit-improving programs initiated the company. The FedEx Express segment that is currently hurting the company's overall bottom line is likely to gain benefits from savings due to headcount reductions and fleet modernization. These steps will also support the reduction in the company's SG&A expense, which eats up around 50% of the company's consolidated revenue, repairs and maintenance, and fuel expense in the coming years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

Furthermore, the guidance for the balance of the full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx has nearly recovered the highs of before UPS lowered guidance and reporting earnings. Those highs are now resistance up to $142.50. Immediate support is the 50-Day MA's $136.25, below which is consolidation down to $130. With the 20-day MA below the 50-day and oil prices already testing above $100, you have to wonder if the stock will retest the 200-day MA early this summer. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx is supporting their stock with a massive buyback and insiders are taking advantage and selling near all-time highs. With oil prices already testing above $100, positive economic indications from FedEx could boost oil prices as much as FedEx's stock price. The stock quickly found support following the weak holiday season and negative UPS earnings report. Previous consolidation levels have built up some sturdy support and resistance inside of $130-$142.50, so the stock probably remains in this range barring some unexpected news in the earnings report. Guidance would be where to look for the unexpected news but has been given in percentages, so would need to be calculated. Analysts having such a broad range for 2015 doesn't suggest a lot of confidence in their estimates.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

2008271,61301,2014-02-11T01:20:13-05:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) have a combined 80% market share in the U.S market. The duopoly nature of the airfreight & surface transportation industry is likely to stay the same in the coming years. The strength of the two companies was in full display when international competitor DHL exited the domestic U.S market in 2009. Between FedEx and UPS, I would pick FedEx because of its sustainable advantages over UPS listed below.I believe these competitive advantages can translate into greater profitability for FedEx in the future with its ongoing cost saving program and its investment in the higher margin Ground division. If FedEx is able to execute its current strategies, I believe there is a 38% upside potential.Cost-saving program that leads to a higher operating marginFedEx launched the cost-saving program in FY13 that aims to increase operating margin to 9.4%, on par with UPS's current margin by the end of FY16, representing an annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion. As part of the cost saving efforts, the Voluntary Buyout Program was launched last year, offering employees who are willing to leave the company with a prepaid salary compensation package. The program has shown encouraging progress. In FY13, 3600 employees have voluntarily left or will be leaving the company by the end of FY14. FedEx has also completed the final retirement of the old inefficient B727 fleet.Investment in the higher margin FedEx Ground divisionIn FY13, FedEx Express's operating margin was 5%, and FedEx Ground's operating margin was 16.9%. By increasing revenue contributed by the higher margin Ground business, FedEx can greatly improve its operating margin. FedEx has shown great progress in this strategic focus as well. In the FY14 Q1 conference call, Alan Graf, FedEx CFO said that FedEx has been gaining market share in the Ground business and will continue the trend through aggressive capital spending. In 2013, 90% of capital expense was used to expand the capacity for growth, including building new hubs, building expansions, and material handling. FedEx is able to realize return from its capital spending by achieving a 9% package volume growth in Ground as oppose to 5% growth in Express in FY13.ValuationI decided to use the enterprise value multiple (EV/EBITD) to compare the valuation of FedEx to that of UPS because this metric takes into account the balance sheet and cash flow.FedEx's EV/EBITD is currently at 6.8, which is inexpensive comparing to UPS's 9.0. UPS is able to trade at a higher multiple because of its higher operating margin. FedEx's margin is around 6% and UPS's margin is around 10%. The major reason behind UPS's higher profitability is its much larger Ground business, which has a significantly higher margin than that of the Express business. Below are the revenue mix charts for FedEx and UPS in FY13.Historically, FedEx has been trading at 5.5 EV/EBITD. It is currently trading at a slightly higher multiple because FedEx's share price has appreciated a lot in the end of 2013 along with the market run-up. Although the stock has recently pulled back a bit, the appreciated share price still reflects investors are optimistic about FedEx. There are a several reasons why investors are relatively optimistic now.In fact, if we apply the current EV to the management forecasted FY14 EBITD, FedEx is now trading at FY14's forward EBITD. It appears that the recent share price appreciation has just priced in the positive news, and assume FedEx's management is going to execute their cost-saving program in the near future. I have tremendous confidence in FedEx's management team, but there are risks that if FedEx is not able to fulfill investors' expectations, FedEx's share price will be under pressure.ConclusionFedEx has been investing 9% of its revenue to expand its business in the past few years, and UPS has no intention to grow its business, investing only 4% of its revenue. FedEx can trade higher in the future if it is able to improve its operating margin (~6%) to UPS's level (~10%) as FedEx continues to take market share in the Ground business and realize its cost-saving by the end of FY16. The fact that FedEx's Ground business has a higher margin than UPS's Ground business is an encouraging sign that FedEx can possibly reach or even exceed UPS's current impressive margin. Financial data in the next few years would reveal if FedEx is indeed gradually increasing its margin to reach that target. I will not be surprised if FedEx is trading at $180 (38% upside), with UPS's current multiple, in the near future.Source: 10K (FedEx and UPS)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.FDX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 11/30/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFDX Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:FedEx Corporation is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. The company has shown insufficient earnings growth over the ten-year period and is trading at PEmg and PB ratios that are too high for the Defensive Investor, but the company passes all of the requirements of the Enterprising Investor. As a result, Enterprising Investors seeking to follow the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable conducting further research into the company and its competitors such as through a review of ModernGraham's analysis of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and a Glance at the Dow.From a valuation perspective, the company appears to be fairly valued. The company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.31 in 2010 to an estimated $5.66 for 2014, a level of demonstrated growth that supports the market's implied estimate of 8.00% earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model has returned an estimate of intrinsic value that falls within a margin of safety in relation to the price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects. What do you think? What value would you put on FedEx Corporation? Where do you see the company going in the future?

1919391,24491,2013-12-29T03:12:38-05:00,,"What is stock analysis? Well, there are some that think it has everything to do with the dividend. There are others that only look at charts. There are others that think analyst estimate misses (notice how this is equivalent to companies' earnings beats) are a way to gauge the trajectory of a stock. And yet there are others who are lost in medieval times. We as investors need to move beyond these individual frameworks and start taking a holistic view. Let's take a look at what we mean as it relates to our analysis with FedEx (NYSE:FDX).At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis it scores high on our scale. FedEx posts a VBI score of 5 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm and its attractive relative valuation versus peers. We compare FedEx to peers CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and UTI Worldwide (NASDAQ:UTIW). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 12.2% during the past three years.• FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services• FedEx's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• FedEx's long-term financial goals are as follows: 1) achieve 10% operating margin; 2) increase EPS 10%- 15% per year; 3) grow profitable revenue; 4) improve cash flows; 5) increase ROIC; 6) and increase the dividend. We like management's focus.• E-commerce and global trade growth continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityMost Recent Quarterly ResultsFedEx reported slightly lower-than-expected bottom-line performance in its fiscal second-quarter results. Revenue advanced 3% during the quarter, while reported operating income leapt 15% thanks to roughly 80 basis points of operating-margin improvement. Adjusted for the effects of Hurricane Sandy, however, year-over-year performance wasn't that great. The firm's quarterly earnings per share mark of $1.57 compares to an adjusted measure of $1.50, or a 4.7% increase, which itself was augmented by its share-repurchase program. Free cash flow was negative during the six months ended November 30, 2013, consistent with the cash use during the prior-year period. The company experienced improved yield and cost management (and materially better operating margin performance) at FedEx Express (its largest operating segment), but overall, the fiscal second-quarter performance wasn't as strong as we would have liked. Share repurchases will continue to bolster the company's bottom-line performance in the quarters ahead.Traditionally, FedEx hasn't generated impressive measures of 'return on assets' and 'return on equity', and performance in the six months ended November 30 was no different. During the period, return on assets came in at just over 5%, while return on equity stood at an even 10%. Our future forecasts for return on invested capital hover in the low-teens, and while this is greater than our estimate of the firm's weighted average cost of capital, indicating economic profit creation, the magnitude is not great. We think FedEx is a good business, not a great one, on the basis of these return measures.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital - ROIC -with its weighted average cost of capital - WACC. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 54% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 42% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $121 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 10%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $121 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $91 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $151 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $121 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $163 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $121 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1912931,58651,2013-12-23T11:14:57-05:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which is best known for the transportation services it offers in the US, released its Q2 earnings report recently. The report showed that the company had missed the analysts' consensus estimates of revenue and EPS growth, apparently due to the softening growth of its core services like FedEx Express. However, the varying levels of demand in the transportation industry has to be factored into the equation. Further, the company has significantly improved its operating margins and raised its growth guidance for 2014. Together these point to a far brighter picture of FedEx going forward than may be evident from the earnings report alone.The bad news in Q2 Earnings ReportThe Q2 earnings report of the second largest transportation services company in the US revealed that the company's EPS stood at $1.57, up 13% from a year ago. However it was below the consensus of $1.64, thus continuing the deceleration shown in Q1. Further, the 13% rise itself appears inflated, since last year's shipping volumes had suffered due to Hurricane Sandy and the EPS this year was helped by the repurchase of 10 million shares by FedEx.FedEx's quarterly revenue rose 3% to $11.4 billion, marginally below the consensus of $11.44 billion. This can be attributed to the decline in growth of daily volume at FedEx Ground - it was 10-11% in the previous two quarters as compared to 8% this fiscal quarter. In addition, the revenue from FedEx Express showed a slight fall as well.Factors to be counted inThe above statistics do not factor in the fact that while the last Cyber Monday fell in November, this year it was in December. The fiscal quarter ended in the middle of the Thanksgiving weekend, which is vital for any transportation business. Hence, the fall in revenue and volume can partly be blamed on an inopportune calendar.On the flipside, these will be counted in the earnings report for the next quarter, and should help boost the figures for holiday season sales. It would not be surprising if the next quarter showed a significant rise in FedEx's fortunes. Keeping this in mind, it is not surprising that the company has raised its full year EPS growth forecast from 8% to 14% from the earlier 7% to 14%.Structural improvements, raised growth guidanceFedEx has remained committed to raising the operating margin to 10%, from the 6.3% it was previously. The cost cutting measures it undertook in this regard have led to the rise of operating margin to 7.3% in Q2, up from 6.5% in the same quarter a year back. Analysts at Deutsche Bank firmly believe that the company will be able to achieve the target operating margin:The investor's choiceAs the above analysis shows, FedEx's less than exciting Q2 earnings report does not fully reflect upon its sales. A higher than expected Q3 growth number will contribute to better annual growth than current targets. Added to this are the cost-cutting measures of the company, which will help it improve profitability in the long run. Together, these indicate that the company will continue to grow at a good pace. Thus, it would be advisable for those already having FedEx in their portfolio to ""hold"" the stock for now, while those who have not yet purchased the company's stock may be advised to buy into FedEx.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1938881,57561,2014-01-10T11:06:31-05:00,,"The year 2013 was another good year for FedEx (NYSE:FDX) bulls with a stock price appreciation of 53%. The company has been rated overweight by big financial service firms like Citigroup and Deutsche Bank due to its strong fundamentals and bright growth prospects. Going forward, can the company continue its bull run?Driving factors for FedEx in 2014FedEx might look overvalued for 2014, but there is more upside potential stemming from the company's initiative and overall market growth, especially from e-commerce. E-commerce is the biggest growth driver for the company with worldwide e-commerce sales expected to hit $1 trillion in 2016, representing 1% of the overall global GDP. U.S. online spending is expected to increase from $262 billion in 2013 to $371 billion in 2017. In the last decade, FedEx launched initiatives focused on the e-commerce market like FedEx Home Delivery (the first dedicated residential delivery service) and FedEx SmartPost (provides an economical option to online retailers for shipping lightweight products at low cost). FedEx SmartPost has played a major role in FedEx's growth in the e-commerce market as this service has been popular among online retailers for providing free shipping. Around 50% of online sales come with free shipping, and this has resulted in strong demand for FedEx SmartPost, which is boosting FedEx's ground segment.This trend has continued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. SmartPost's average daily volume increased 9% year over year. Going forward, the ground segment revenue growth will sustain this year due to demand from e-commerce supported by the increased shipping rate in the ground segment, including SmartPost, effective from January 6, 2014.FedEx's ground segment helped the company offset the decline in the FedEx express segment in the last quarterly result. FedEx Express is the premium next-day air service provided by the company, but a shift in the trend towards the demand for slower and cheaper shipments services has adversely affected the segment's revenue thereby putting pressure on the margins.In October 2012, FedEx had laid out the profit improvement program to reduce operating cost to boost profit by $1.7 billion by fiscal year 2016. Most of the restructuring is occurring at the FedEx Express division with fleet modernization, replacing the existing fleet of Boeing 727s, MD 10s and MD 11s with newer, more-fuel-efficient aircraft including Boeing 757s and 767s. Boeing 757s are a 20% cost improvement and the Boeing 767s are a 30% cost improvement compared to the company's existing fleet.In December 2013, FedEx placed an order for two new 767-300F freighters from Boeing, adding to the initial order of 50 new 767-300F freighters. Boeing delivered the first 767-300F freighter in September 2013, and the remaining planes are expected to be delivered through 2019. Fuel expenses as a percentage of the total revenue of the Express segment is currently pegged at 14.5% (second quarter of fiscal year 2014). Therefore, this percentage will come down going forward. FedEx Express is the company's biggest segment with 61% share in total revenue for fiscal year 2013. Therefore, these cost reduction initiatives positively impact the company's overall margin as well as the segment's margin.These initiatives were targeted from the cost perspective, while also boosting the express segment's revenue. Additionally, the company is actively pursuing international market opportunities. International revenue forms 45% of the FedEx Express revenue (for fiscal year 2013), so it is an important source for the segment's growth.FedEx is also streamlining the organization by removing redundant jobs. In June last year, FedEx completed a voluntary buyout program to reduce human personnel by 3,600, helping it reach the target of achieving a $1.7 billion profit boost by its fiscal year 2016.Overall FedEx is all set to post a strong result in 2014. The positive macro environment (increase in consumer spending) and strong demand from e-commerce will be significant growth drivers for the company. In addition, improving overall margins, mainly contributed by FedEx Express segment, will also promote strong profitability.How UPS might affect FedEx's growth in 2014?Like FedEx, UPS (NYSE:UPS) has also been a beneficiary of the e-commerce boom, and its air services' margins have also been affected by the changing consumer trend to shift to cheaper ground services rather than faster and expensive air services.UPS has taken bold initiatives towards e-commerce, and due to its leading position in ground logistics, the company was the beneficiary of the consumer shift towards cheaper ground transportation while FedEx, being more inclined towards the air-based delivery system, was adversely affected by this trend. However, FedEx has implemented key initiatives to increase its presence in ground logistics and reduced FedEx Express costs to remain competitive in the market.In the e-commerce market, UPS has an important partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). During the third week of December, Amazon added 1 million new Prime customers, and a staggering 36.8 million items were ordered from the website on Cyber Monday alone. This is a record membership set during the holiday season for Amazon Prime, with its annual membership program offering free two day shipments on its items. Therefore, UPS benefited significantly from having Amazon as a partner. In addition, UPS had also launched a Mobile App for the Amazon Kindle Fire Family that allows customers to manage their delivery packages.On the cost side, UPS has improved its margin, thus operating as an industry leader with operational margin of 13.7% for the first nine months of 2013. The key initiatives towards this involved speeding up the deployment of On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation, or ORION software, which optimizes delivery routes to reduces miles driven. The company plans to deploy this software to nearly all 55,000 routes by 2017. A reduction of one mile per day saves cost up to $50 million annually in expenses, so full deployment of this software across all routes will bring significant cost reduction. UPS is also aiming to shift towards natural gas and announced plans to purchase 700 LNG vehicles and build 13 fueling stations by the end of 2014. UPS has noted that shifting towards LNG will result in savings of 24 million gallons of diesel fuel annually.Therefore, the industry leader will affect FedEx's growth plans, and it will be difficult for FedEx to gain market share in light of the stiff competition. FedEx has been working hard to remain competitive in the market, so it will be interesting to see which company benefits the most and gains traction in the logistics market.ConclusionFedEx's growth fundamentals look solid, and after its cost initiatives, the company will have high profitability to return to shareholders. FedEx has always provided good shareholder returns in terms of share repurchase, and during October of last year, the company authorized another share repurchase program for 32 million outstanding shares of common stock, thus augmenting the 7.4 million shares left in the previous authorization. From the investment point of view, FedEx looks relatively undervalued compared to its peer based on its trailing twelve months P/E 27.18X and Price to Sales ratio of 0.97 compared to UPS's forward P/E of 66.81x and P/S ratio of 1.72, which indicate that FedEx still has upside potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1956891,56822,2014-01-21T09:41:09-05:00,,"With annual revenues exceeding $45 billion FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is no small player in the logistics and cargo delivery sector. Thanks to recent shipment delays by its rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) whose services were contracted for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) FedEx could be in line to win a long term contract in the future to service the shipment needs of this online retailer. However, that's not all FedEx has lined up and I wouldn't place my bet on this news alone. There are a lot more events going on for the company that makes it an attractive investment for long term buyers.The year 2014 is going well for FedEx. During its last (2nd) quarter, the company increased its sales to $11.4 billion reflecting a 3% increase since the same quarter a year ago. This resulted in higher product volumes and yield increases. The less dominant segments saw increasing revenue and the company's highest revenue generating segment, FedEx Express that provides delivery services all around the world, was supported by the bottom line profit improvement initiatives that flourished despite revenue decline.Thanks to the Profit Improving Initiatives, FedEx Express saw a 43% jump in Operating IncomeThe initiatives such as modernizing the fleet to allow for lower maintenance costs was the reason that even though the Express service's revenues remained stable during the last quarter the company was able to report an operating income increase of 43% taking the absolute value to $326 million! If these initiatives are maintained I expect the efficiency to settle at a decent rate in the future.Source: 10QThe most important point about the Express segment is that during the last quarter the company experienced increasing growth from international & US based packages and Trade Network customers but this was offset by lower freight revenue as well as negative impact from fuel surcharges that caused the total segment revenue to remain nearly stable. The company picked up on the trend of higher package volume since the beginning of 2014 (graph above).Freight revenue made up only $1 billion (average) of the company's quarterly revenue. Removing fuel surcharges could allow FedEx to generate even more improvements within the segment. With the initiatives already in place and growing volume trend we can be almost certain that the segment will improve its performance in the upcoming period.With regards to costs, FedEx's operating expenses are positively related to its revenue and volumes. FedEx incurred a lower pension expense and a modest benefit from the voluntary employee severance program it announced in 2013. Similarly, depreciation and fuel expenses also declined as a percentage of total revenue. A majority of these costs that increased, such as purchased transportation, were a result of the company's expansion plans (in FedEx Trade Network) as well as those that were positively correlated to revenue and volume growth. All in all, operating costs fell 80 bps as a percentage of revenue bringing the operating margin to 7.3%.The diluted EPS reported by the company reflected a 13% increase to $1.57. It is important to note that the 2013 result's included a $0.11 impact that was related to superstorm Sandy. However, to the delight of investors, even if we exclude the total impact from the quarterly diluted EPS, FedEx experienced a 4.67% increase since the corresponding quarter of 2013. That was higher than the overall increase the company experienced with regards to its revenue.FedEx Continues to Increase its International Presence Last year, the company made an agreement to acquire its service provider, Supaswift that caters to most of FedEx's operations in the 5 countries of Southern Africa along with 2 new countries. Increased control in its regions of operation will allow the company to expand further and bring more markets into its reach. The acquisition is supposed to be completed this year and with that comes further assurance that the delivery revenues particularly for the Express segment will be enhanced.These expansions are being financed through the company's CFO. The company has no short reserves available but $3.9 billion was available last November after paying for tax refunds and financing pension obligations. This means that the company can further sustain such programs in the future.The BuybackA few days ago, FedEx announced that it was selling $2 billion senior notes and will use the proceeds to buy back shares as part of its newly implemented buyback plan. I do not believe that issuing more debt will harm the company as it already trades below the industry's debt to equity ratio of 0.6. The 0.2 D/E of FedEx will only come a little in line with the industry and will bring in more value for investors through the positive sentiment it spreads and create price appreciation.ConclusionFedEx has seen its product mix shift towards more economical offerings than the high priced alternatives. By expanding into new markets and lowering costs through profit management initiatives I believe it can sustain the changing mix. Adding everything up, there are small positive improvements going on in the company: profit initiatives, expansion and buybacks. All of this exists amidst an economy that is expected to grow moderately in the short term.The share price has increased by 45% adding nearly $45 to its present value of $142. The company has profit margins above that of the industry although the trailing ROE has floated at 10% and is below the industry's 15.6%. Nonetheless, the share price appreciation has provided more than what has been short of dividends. The factors above make me certain that FedEx will continue riding this growing share price trend and bring continuing value to shareholders. Therefore I recommend buying the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1904751,53552,2013-12-18T09:36:13-05:00,,"This morning FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported earnings that were generally weaker than analysts were expecting (press release available here). In the quarter, earnings were $1.57 on $11.4 billion in sales, and analysts were looking for $1.64 and $11.44 billion in sales. Nonetheless, results were better than a year ago with sales up 3% and earnings up 4% from last year's adjusted $1.50 in EPS. Even though this quarter was a bit disappointing, the company did boost full year guidance to 8-14% EPS growth from 7-13% EPS growth. Analysts have already been expecting 12% EPS growth this year, so this bump in guidance is unlikely to change expectations. Given the shares' run this year, was this quarter good enough to merit buying FDX?(Click to enlarge)After this quarter, I continue to be concerned about FedEx Express, which really continues to struggle. Consumers seem content to go for slower ground options, which generate less revenue. For many years, a major component of competition in the shipping business was speed, and we seem to be shifting away from that. Express was down again year over year from $6.86 to $6.84 billion. Express is the main driver of the business, and unless it returns to growth, FDX will struggle to grow revenue over the long term.To offset declines in the domestic express business, FDX has focused on expanding to international markets to boost revenue. Unfortunately, we are seeing the same trend overseas that we are seeing in the United States. International Economy daily volume jumped 10%, which is pretty solid. On the other hand, International Priority saw daily volume fall 5%. At the end of the day, the company is much better off if Priority grows rather than Economy because the company can charge more for these packages. Unfortunately, consumers and businesses continue to shift towards cheaper options, which is a major headwind for the company.Fortunately, the company's cheaper alternatives have been performing well with daily volume at Ground up 8% and Freight up 4%. While it seems that FedEx is gaining some share in these markets, FedEx is likely cannibalizing itself. In other words, customers who used to ship FedEx Express are now shipping FedEx Ground. In this situation, Ground looks strong and Express weak, but overall, the company is slightly worse off as these cheaper options are not the ones the company wants customers taking.Businesses and consumers are increasingly cost sensitive and if a package does not have to arrive for a few days will use a cheaper alternative. As the shipping market returns to a point where price rather than speed becomes the major driver of competition, I am concerned that FedEx could see increasing pricing pressure and declining margins alongside UPS (NYSE:UPS). Until FedEx can start to grow its premium services, revenue is likely to grow slowly in the 0-3% range, and EPS growth will be driven by cost cutting and share buybacks rather than a growing topline.In this environment, I do think FedEx shares are overpriced even with analysts looking for 12% EPS growth in 2014. With $7 in 2014 earnings, shares are trading at 19.86x, which is especially expensive for a company whose fate is so closely tied to economic growth. With shifts towards lower end products, I believe FedEx will be facing decelerating growth over the next three years. After a 50% 2013 rally, I think shares have moved enough, and this quarter does not merit such a high earnings multiple. Even if shares fell 10% to $126, they would still trade at a pretty pricey 18x earnings. At 20x, FedEx is a sell, and I would not be interested in buying unless shares fell below $120.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1910201,23471,2013-12-20T15:35:59-05:00,,"Here is a look at how FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fares in ModernGraham's opinion, based on an updated and modernized version of Benjamin Graham's requirements of defensive and enterprising investors from The Intelligent Investor:Defensive and Enterprising Investor Tests (What is the significance of these tests, and what is PEmg ratio?):Defensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least four of the following five tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation Summary (Explanation of the ModernGraham Valuation Model)Key Data:Balance Sheet - 8/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - Modern GrahamConclusion:FedEx is a company whose earnings have been a little unstable over the 10-year historical period we've reviewed. The company showed great growth during the first half of the period, then had a strong pullback from $6.48 in EPS for 2007 to $0.31 for 2009. This drop can probably be attributed significantly to the recession, but it is noteworthy nonetheless. In addition, the earnings issue has affected the company's standing with Defensive Investors, as it has led the company to fail the Defensive Investor's earnings growth requirement. The company also fails the Defensive Investors requirements of low PEmg and PB ratios, and hence is not suitable for the Defensive Investor. However, Enterprising Investors are more willing to take on risk than their Defensive Investor counterparts, and FedEx passes the Enterprising Investor's requirements with flying colors. From the valuation side of things, the market currently implies a growth rate of 7.93%, and that growth is supported by the recent trend in the earnings after the company has grown EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.45 in 2009 to an estimated $5.74 for 2014. As a result, the company appears to be fairly valued and Enterprising Investors should feel comfortable proceeding with further research to determine if it is suitable for their individual portfolios.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Fedex Corporation (FDX) at the time of publication and had no intention of entering into a position within the next 72 hours."
1909101,25120,2013-12-20T06:07:29-05:00,,"Investors in FedEx (NYSE:FDX) have had a great run this year amidst improved operational excellence, higher revenues and shareholder-friendly initiatives. After this great run up analysts at multiple research firms boost their recommendation for the shares ahead of the second quarter results as reported on Wednesday.I believe analysts might be jumping on the bandwagon a bit late, and would not chase shares up at this current level. I remain on the sidelines.Second Quarter ResultsFedEx generated second quarter revenues of $11.40 billion, up 2.7% on the year before, slightly missing consensus estimates at $11.44 billion.Net earnings rose by 14% to $500 million as earnings per share rose by 13% to $1.57 per share. Note that last year's earnings included a $0.11 per share charge on the back of the impact of superstorm Sandy. Earnings came in a little short of estimates, with analysts looking for earnings of $1.64 per share.The strong earnings growth was driven by solid operating margin expansion, with margins increasing by 80 basis points to 7.3% of total revenues.The express segment reported flat revenue growth, yet the margins saw a big boost. Revenues came in at $6.84 billion, while operating margins rose by 140 basis points to 4.8% of total revenues. Cost reduction efforts, higher package yields and lower pension expenses boosted margins.The ground business reported a solid 10% growth in revenues to $2.85 billion. Margins saw some pressure falling by 100 basis points to 14.9% of total sales. The continued growth in e-commerce boosted revenues, while margins fell on the back of a later start of the holiday shipping season.The freight business reported a 4% increase in revenues to $1.43 billion. Margins were essentially flat at 5.4% of total revenues.Analyst Are BullishAt the end of last week, analysts upgraded FedEx already ahead of the second quarter earnings report, citing further potential for cost cutting and revenue growth.Analysts at Raymond James upgraded FedEx as the company is set to deliver further gains. Analyst Arthur Hatfield upgraded FedEx from ""Outperform"" to ""Strong Buy"". Hatfield attaches a 12-month price target of $190 per share, suggesting some 38% upside from Friday's closing levels last week.There is more value in the shares on the back of the aggressive cost improvement plans which are in progress and are on track according to Hatfield. Given the aggressiveness and the relative transformative plan, the stock should be trading less on current earnings power, but more on the back of earnings power a few years down the road.Actually it is not just analysts at Raymond James which are bullish. Citigroup attached a $170 price target to the shares as well. Cost efforts at the express segment, higher volumes and share buybacks should drive future earnings. Earnings of $10 per share should ""enter the discussion"" in 2015, which combined with historical multiples of 17 times earnings explains the price target.ValuationThe company ended the second quarter of its fiscal 2014 with $4.0 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stands at $3.0 billion for a net cash position of around $1.0 billion.Revenues for the first six months of the fiscal year of 2014 came in at $22.4 billion, up 2% on the year before. Net earnings rose by 10% to $989 million. At this pace, annual revenues are seen around $45 billion, while earnings could increase towards $2.2 billion.Trading around $140 per share, the market values FedEx at roughly $44 billion, which values operating assets of the firm at $43 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at little below 1.0 times annual revenues and 20 times GAAP earnings.FedEx currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.4%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term investors in FedEx have seen modestly solid results, driven by the run up of the shares into 2013. Shares fell from highs of $120 in 2006 towards lows of just $40 in 2009.Shares mostly traded in a $70-$100 trading range following the recovery. Since the start of the year, shares have risen by about 50% to current levels approaching $140 per share.Between the fiscal year of 2010 and 2013, FedEx has increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 27% to $44.3 billion. Earnings rose by about a third to little above $1.5 billion last year.Sophisticated Investors Buy The Growth StoryRecently FedEx has attracted some prominent investors. Dan Loeb who runs Third Point LLC has recently bought a 2 million shares stake in the business. Loeb aims for a more shareholder friendly capital structure, accompanied by higher dividends, given FedEx's paltry dividends at the moment. Loeb might also be involved with the succession planning of CEO and Chairman Fred Smith, after he recruited Marissa Mayer for Yahoo (YHOO).Other recent investors include Soros Fund Management, the fund behind Georgo Soros which bought a 1.5 million share stake in the firm. Despite these prominent investors, large changes are unlikely. FedEx already announced share repurchases and a cost reduction program. There is more room however for further dividend hikes given the solid earnings, strong capital structure and low current dividend yield.Perhaps these ""sophisticated"" investors are attracted to FedEx given its strong exposure to the growing e-commerce. The company previously expected to make 19 million shipments on December 10, which is going to be a peak day. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas the company expects to ship 280 million packages. This projection sees shipments up 13% on the year, on the back of continued growth in e-commerce shopping, requiring FedEx to hire a staff of 20,000 on a temporarily basis to handle all these additional flows.Investment ThesisInvestors are pleased with the progress of FedEx which is targeting massive improvements at the Express business.The express business generates the vast majority of the revenues, some $6.85 billion in the second quarter of the fiscal year of 2014, roughly unchanged from last year. The unit generated operating earnings of ""merely"" $326 million, for operating margins of 4.8% which was up already 140 basis points compared to last year. In total, FedEx targets $1.6 billion in operating earnings improvement for this business, boosting margins towards 10%.The ground business continues to drive the results, and notably earnings on the back of the growth in e-commerce. Revenues came in at $2.85 billion, up 10% on the year before. The unit generates the vast majority of earnings of $424 million, with high operating margins of 14.9%.The ambitious targets to boost operating margins towards 10% of total revenues, could result in annual operating earnings of about $5.0 billion by the fiscal year of 2016. This could boost GAAP earnings to $3 billion per annum by the fiscal year of 2016, valuing the business at 14 times earnings at the time.For now, FedEx is already making progress, as the business has a great reputation for achieving long-term market share gains. The 3.9% to 4.5% price hike target for its business in January of 2014 will boost earnings in the immediate term as well. On top of that, the company aims to repurchase 32 million shares, which at a current price could cost the company upto $4.5 billion. Given the solid financial position, this should provide no problem for the balance sheet. During the second quarter, FedEx actually repurchased 7.2 million shares, or 2.3% of its current float which is quite aggressive.Back in September, when FedEx reported its first quarter results, I last took a look at the company's prospects, as I concluded to remain on the sidelines despite the attractive valuation multiples on the back of low dividends. Ever since, shares have risen about 25% in just three month's time, raising the expectations for the second quarter results later this week. Real improvements will come later this year and into next year with fleet modernization, lay-offs and cost controls making a real impact on the earnings.While earnings of $10 per share in 2016 might be realistic, this still values the business at around 14 times earnings two or three years ahead. Given the big run-up in recent times, it seems that analysts are running behind the bandwagon, as I would be much more cautious at current levels.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company predicts a strong holiday season, and plans to make 85 million shipments the week following cyber Monday, which would be about a 13% increase from the past year. FedEx also plans to increase shipping rates after the New Year. Is the stock still a buy at current levels?FedEx Express said the company will increase shipping rates by an average of 3.9% for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services effective January 6, 2014. The FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost pricing changes for 2014 will not be announced until later this year. The price increases could help margins and help drive earnings when the company reports in December.Last quarter FedEx delivered despite facing headwinds of a tough airfreight market, unfavorable fuel price movements, and one fewer operating day compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company was able to improved margins at Express, while accelerating volume growth at Ground. FedEx reiterated FY14 guidance of 7%-13% YOY growth in EPS, in line with their estimates.Recent Quarterly Results:· FedEx Express- Revenue of $6.61 billion, down slightly from last year's $6.63 billion. Operating income of $236 million, up 14% from $207 million a year ago and operating margin of 3.6%, up from 3.1% the previous year.· FedEx Ground- Revenue of $2.73 billion, up 11% from last year's $2.46 billion and operating income of $468 million, up 5% from $445 million a year ago. Operating margin of 17.1%, down from 18.1% the previous year.· FedEx Freight- Revenue of $1.42 billion, up 2% from last year's $1.40 billion. Operating income of $91 million was up 1% from $90 million a year ago. Operating margin of 6.4%, were unchanged from 6.4% the previous year.After this, again, the stock sold off initially, this time it dropped about 4% over the few weeks following the September 18 report. However, shares rallied 27% over the next two months following that post earnings dip. Turns out billionaire investors George Soros and John Paulson joined Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, took large positions at the end of Q3 in FedEx Corp.· Soros Fund Management LLC bought 1.52 million shares valued at $173 million at the end of the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing yesterday (Cost $113)· Paulson & Co. disclosed a new stake of 646,800 shares valued at $73.8 million. (Cost $114)· Third Point reported a holding of 2 million FedEx shares, valued at $228.2 million. (Cost $114)Sometimes, when hedge-fund managers take large stakes in companies, they seek material changes. However, these managers will have to confront a strong-willed CEO in Fred Smith, who already has his company trading at all-time highs. Smith was optimistic about the holiday season when he was interviewed on CNBC on November 15. ""We project our peak day to be Cyber Monday,"" Smith said. ""The peak shopping day is a little different this year because the time is compressed between Thanksgiving and Christmas"". We will soon officially find out if that is true.Smith predicted a strong holiday season for his company, with 10% - 11% growth in shipments to 22 million on Cyber Monday. He added that the company plans to make 85 million shipments that week, about a 13% increase from the past year. However, he was not as optimistic on the economy. ""The economy is not strong,"" Smith said. ""It is not strong because we don't have pro-growth policies in terms of taxes and trade and the centerpiece of that is reforming the tax code to incentive more business investment.""FDX has returned 76% over the most recent two-year period, while competitors United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is up 50%, and C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (CHRW) lost 11% and Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD) gained 6%.FedEx reports its next quarterly report on December 18 before the market open. Smart money will be watching price of FDX, and shares of FedEx are up over 50% YTD. The large positions taken recently by hedge funds are sitting on better than 20% profits right now, so if these fund managers anticipate any weakness in the coming quarter, they could look to take profits. Investors, who chase the stock at resistance, might find themselves behind the curve.In the end price is what makes us money, and according to the Stock Traders Daily real-time trading report, FDX is testing long-term resistance. We are sellers near resistance, and if resistance holds, we would expect shares to move lower and eventually test support. Based on the real-time trading report published by Stock Traders Daily, FDX is a sell/short at resistance, with risk controls in place if resistance breaks higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receives compensation from the publicly traded companies listed herein for writing this article."
1898081,23625,2013-12-13T15:22:42-05:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is another company that has experienced incredible stock growth throughout the bull market of 2013. The delivery services company began the year trading at $92.36 and since announcing a share repurchase program in October the stock has taken off to prices in the mid $130s. At a time when retail sales are going through a difficult period, how do analysts expect FedEx to perform?FedEx is expected to report FQ2 2014 earnings on Wednesday, December 18th. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for FDX to report $1.64 EPS and $11.483B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from nine Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.62 EPS and $11.483B revenue. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we're seeing a smaller differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers compared to previous quarters.Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has increased from $1.61 to $1.64 while Wall Street revenue expectations have dropped from $11.525B to $11.462B. The Estimize EPS consensus has risen this quarter from $1.61 to $1.62 and revenue has fallen from $11.516B to $11.483B.Over the previous six quarters, FDX has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS four times and revenue three times. Over the same time period FDX has beaten the Estimize EPS consensus three times and was accurately forecasted once. FedEx exceeded the Estimize consensus on revenue three times.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $1.57 to $1.66 EPS and $11.312B to $11.550B in revenues. We're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates this quarter for FDX than normal. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution signaling the potential for less volatility post earnings, a wider vice versa.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is JL7913 who projects a $1.60 EPS and $11.490B in revenue. JL7913 is a hedge-fund analyst who covers 57 industrial stocks on our platform and is ranked 116 of 3340 contributing analysts overall. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. Like the Estimize community, JL7913 is expecting more revenue and lower EPS than Wall Street.Disclosure: None."
1902431,24706,2013-12-17T08:46:49-05:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to report 2Q 2014 earnings before the bell on Wednesday, December 18. The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Results from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. Furthermore, the guidance for the balance of the full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx shares recently broke out to an all-time high of $140.81, and is up more than 53% YTD. However, the shares have struggled to make a definitive push through this level, implying Wednesday's earnings must significantly surpass consensus estimates to trigger a breakout to the upside. Should FedEx shares fail to meet the high end of Street views, initial support is at $135, with downside risk to $130. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)(Click to enlarge)SummaryFedEx shares are trading near and all-time high, benefiting from restructuring efforts announced last October designed to drastically reduce costs, share repurchases, and upgrades to its fleet. The company is also benefiting from improving e-commerce growth trends and increased market share. But with the shares up 53% YTD and difficulty making a sustained push through the $140-level, FedEx is vulnerable to even the slightest missteps, following the recent flurry of upbeat sell-side comments and technically overbought conditions.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1892301,32001,2013-12-11T13:11:28-05:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) reports their fiscal 2nd quarter, 2014 earnings before the opening bell on Tuesday, December 18th, 2013, with analyst consensus looking for $1.63 in earnings per share (EPS) on $11.43 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 17% and 3% respectively.Analyst consensus estimates for the 2nd quarter '14 have remained relatively stable since the September '13 earnings release, where consensus for q2 '14 was expecting $1.62 and $11.440 billion in revenues.The big news in the last year for FDX was the announcement of the 32 million share repurchase program on October 15, 2013, which pushed the stock from the $114 - $115 price area into the low $130's where FDX trades today.Thirty-two million shares is roughly 10% of FDX's 319 million fully-diluted shares outstanding as of the 8/31/13 quarter end, so the buyback is material from an EPS perspective.The many SeekingAlpha readers which populate the site can have varied and different time horizons, from a trading or investing perspective. We tend to be long-term investors for client portfolios, and have combined a blend of value and growth investing within the accounts.Our oldest position in FDX is from March, 2000, with a $36 cost basis. Since then, within most client accounts, we have traded the stock, and have done pretty well for clients in terms of FDX's total-return. (Fundamentally, our internal spreadsheet goes all the way back to February, 1998, which is a 15 year history of FDX's financial results.)Over the last 10 years, FDX has struggled with volume growth, particularly in Express, where, according to one analyst (can't recall the source), Express volume had not grown or even contracted, for 6 of the last 7 years ended May, 2013.FDX Express is 60% of FDX's total revenues, but just 30% of its operating income last quarter, so the negative leverage for a key business is easy to see.FDX Ground on the other hand is the exact opposite story for FDX: Just 25% of FDX's total revenues, Ground accounts for 50% of FDX's operating income, and the Ground segment has been generating positive volume growth with good yields since the inception of the segment in 2000.Here is a brief table on the breakdown of FDX's revenue and operating income by segment:FDX has embarked on a cost-cutting initiative within Express that has reduced headcount and downsize the unit so that the fixed-cost structure is appropriate for a low-single-digit volume growth rate within Express.The plus side to that is any improvement in volume at Express, if and when it should ever occur will drive better EPS growth, as FDX Corp has taken fixed costs out of the Express P/L, thus more revenues will get to the bottom line.The last year there has been a ""trade-down"" effect at Express as SouthEast Asian customers have gravitated to lower-cost freight options, presumably shipping and container, versus airfreight.In the meantime, Ground continues to execute well. The segment has been a stalwart as Express and Freight have languished, with mid to high single digit volume growth rates and good yields.Whether it was the DHL exit from the U.S. market, or some other factor, a price war hasn't developed between FDX and UPS (NYSE:UPS) in the Ground segment. The competition is very rational and yields have remained healthy allowing both companies to continue to maintain margins.FDX's valuation on a p.e basis seems normal at 19(x) and 15(x) forward earnings for 2014 and '15 of $7.01 and $8.84, and given the expected EPS growth in fiscal '14 and '15 of 13% and 26% the next two fiscal years.Price to cash-flow is 8(x), which is about right for a highly leveraged business, with price to free-cash-flow (NYSE:FCF) of over 20(x), which is why the share buyback kind of surprised me.To repo the 10% of the shares outstanding, FDX needs to generate more free-cash-flow. As of the Aug. '13 quarter, FDX's FCF was $1.8 billion (4-quarter trailing) which at the time of the report, meant FDX could repo 15 million shares, and that is if ALL the free-cash went to the repo, which it can't, since FDX pays a dividend.The share repo will likely take a few years to conclude, unless FDX adds to the $3 billion in long-term debt outstanding, which they could do.In terms of intrinsic value, our internal model values FDX near $150, while Morningstar has a current ""intrinsic value"" on FDX of $125.Technically, a pullback to the February, 2007 high of $121.42 would likely be a good place for technical support of the stock, and a place to buy for a trade.What would likely need to happen to see an upward bias to intrinsic value of FDX ?1.) Continued decline in crude oil prices and jet fuel, which if the surcharge is still in place, adds to FDX's bottom line. Of course the opposite is true as well;2.) Reinvigorated Express volume, which would mean the segment would see volume growth rise from the -2% to 3% range, solidly into mid-single-digits. That isn't out of the question given the recovery in Japan, and China, but I do believe we would need to see a prolonged streak of decent GDP growth in the global economy.3.) Jeff Bezos' shot across the bow with the drones and same-day delivery, was in my opinion a direct shot at FDX and UPS. Same day delivery is coming, and many retailers and will evolve to provide that service for customers. FDX and UPS could benefit from this I would think, over the long run, but they would need to do it in a cost-effective manner;4.) Probably less well understood and maybe a smaller impact is the SP 500 returns in 2013 as well as higher interest rates, both of which impact pension benefit obligations positively. FDX could see some savings on pension expense given their union workforce, although to be honest I haven't run the math on this in years, and with the shrinkage in the Express workforce, this may become less of an issue in the future.To conclude, FDX is approaching full valuation given the current state of the world, but the p.e-to-growth ratio's on the stock for the next two years are pretty reasonable, and faster global growth would be a definite plus.Disclosure: I am long FDX, AMZN.

1869771,23479,2013-12-01T05:29:18-05:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) is a global leader in logistics and transportation, with a market leadership position in express airfreight services. The company competes with other logistics players such as United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and international players like TNT and DHL, in the $4 trillion logistics market. Its service model, featuring extensive express airfreight services, differentiates it from the rest of its competitors who have a larger footprint in ground operations.FedEx recently extended its alliance with healthcare products provider Cardinal Health, a multi-billion dollar healthcare services company, to expand its healthcare shipment services. In this note, we take a brief look at the global healthcare product logistics industry and focus on the positives of this alliance for FedEx. We have a Trefis price estimate of $139 for FedEx, which is marginally higher than its current market price of $137.Logistics Provider Reach To Support Healthcare Shipment Market GrowthGlobal healthcare shipments are estimated to be worth $7.5 billion today and are expected to reach $9.3 billion by 2017. This represents a 4.5% growth in logistics spend for biopharma products annually. In comparison, the overall biopharma sector is expected to grow at 6.6% annually, from $209 billion in 2012 to $288 billion by 2017. This higher growth rate in the biopharma sector, compared to the logistics spent on part of healthcare product manufacturers, is driving investments into new supply chain service offerings into the market.Demand for biopharmaceutical products is on the rise due not only to advancements in medical technology and personalized medicines, but to innovation driven demand in emerging economies and increasing life expectancy globally. In order to maximize their growth from this surge in demand, healthcare product manufacturers are expanding both their offerings across service channels and their product portfolios. By partnering with global logistics players, healthcare players gain additional opportunities to grow the top line by expanding the domestic and international reach of their products.FedEx May Be Looking To Emulate UPS' Success In Healthcare Shipment DivisionThe latest partnership between FedEx and Cardinal Health is an indication of the company's attempt to bolster top line growth through services other than its principal operating division, FedEx Express. The Express segment has been under pressure due to a heavier impact from increasing fuel costs, resulting in a migration of customer demand from faster airfreight services to longer and cheaper modes of transportation. Express segment revenues account for 62% of the total $43.5 billion revenues for FedEx.FedEx's Supply Chain and Trade Network division includes various supply chain service offerings for cold chain, and other temperature and time sensitive products. Revenues from the segment grew 23% annually compared to flat sales for UPS' supply chain business between 2008 and 2012. However, absolute revenues of $1.21 billion from FedEx's supply chain division are significantly lower than the $6.77 billion generated from supply chain operations by competitor UPS in 2012.UPS had the first mover advantage in the niche healthcare logistics market, though it has posted flat revenues in the past four years. The company allocated 30 of its 130 global distribution facilities to dedicated healthcare logistics operations and recently added two new facilities in China to cater to the fast growing Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical market. With the extended alliance, FedEx plans to pursue a similar business model and ship Cardinal Health's medical equipment and biopharmaceutical products through its 40 domestic warehouses and distribution facilities across the U.S. We believe that the healthcare alliance strengthens the company's position in the global supply chain service market, which is expected to grow approximately 10% annually through 2017.FedEx's current offerings of various temperature sensitive, monitoring and visibility services should bode well with the current trend in the healthcare shipments market. Going forward, we expect FedEx to increase its service offerings in its healthcare logistics segment in response to an increase in cold chain shipments of medical and pharmaceutical products. On the flip side, the lack of sufficient footing in ground-based operations could force the company to have higher pricing per shipment, resulting in a significant drag on top line growth for its supply chain business.Disclosure: No positions"
1904631,50662,2013-12-18T08:39:53-05:00,,"IntroductionIn this article, I'll have a closer look at FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) which has just released its financial results for the second quarter of the financial year 2014. I will provide my view on the financial results and the company's balance sheet, where after I will discuss the outlook for the company. This will result in my investment thesis at the end of this article.My view on the financial resultsIn the second quarter of FY 2014, FedEx reported a revenue of $11.4B, which is a 3% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Most segments are relatively stable, but one notices there's a huge increase in the FedEx Ground segment, which increased by 10%. The expenses increased slower than the revenues which caused the operating income to increase by an excellent 15% to $827M (vs. $718M last year).The tax rate for FedEx remains relatively stable at 36.5%, and the company paid $292M in income taxes which resulted in a net income of exactly $500M, which is a 14% increase compared to last year and results in a quarterly EPS of $1.57.As most of my readers know, I always like to have a look at the cash flow statements of companies, as I think these statements offer a better indication on the quality of the underlying business. So when we move over to the cash flow statements, we see the company recorded an operating cash flow of $1.6B which it entirely spent on capital expenditures, which caused the company to be (barely) free cash flow negative. However, this result was influenced by the $1B change in working capital, and without this change, FedEx would have seen a free cash flow of approximately $1B.(Click to enlarge)The management team is also showing some shareholder love, as it repurchased another 7.2M shares in the second quarter, bringing the total to 10 million shares (3.1% of the outstanding shares) which were acquired at an average price of $121/share. As the company has extended its share repurchase program, I expect these buybacks to continue and this will ultimately benefit the shareholders.My view on the balance sheetMoving over to the balance sheet, the company enjoyed a very healthy working capital position totaling $5.5B of which $3.9B was being held in cash. The current ratio is a very healthy 2.01, which means the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. As the working capital status looks excellent, I expect FedEx to continue to aggressively repurchase its own shares for cancellation, and I expect the company to end the financial year 2014 with approximately 295 million outstanding shares (which is approximately 4.5% lower than today). This will obviously enhance the earnings and cash flow per share.The book value (based on 309.4M outstanding shares after repurchasing 7.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year) was $56.67, which means the company is currently trading at almost 2.5 times its book value.OutlookThe share repurchases will have a positive effect of approximately $0.04 per share for the FY 2014 financial results, and I expect this effect to be larger in FY 2015 as FedEx' total share count will be lower than 300 million shares by the end of this financial year.The big question is whether or not the company will be free cash flow positive, as the management team has reiterated the capital expenditure guidance of $4B during FY 2014. Based on the first six months of this year, I'm expecting an operating cash flow of $4.8B, so even though the company will increase capex spending by 50% in H2 2014, I still think FedEx will end the year in a free cash flow positive territory.Investment thesisFedEx isn't exactly cheap right now, especially if you know most of the operational cash flow will be re-invested which reduces the amount of free cash flow. However, investors in FedEx should have a longer-term vision, as revenues are expected to increase by 25% over the next five years. If the management team is able to keep the operating margins stable (or even marginally increase them), shareholders are in for an attractive ride, especially as the company keeps reducing its share count.At this moment, I wouldn't want to pay $139/share, but I do realize that FedEx offers a very interesting investment case. As most of my readers know, I prefer to write put options instead of just buying the stock. In FedEx' case, I'm particularly looking at writing a P120 July 2014 for an option premium of $4.00 or a P 100 January 2015 for an option premium of $3.00. If I don't get the shares assigned, these option premiums result in an annualized yield of respectively 5.72% and 2.77%.FedEx Corp. is a buy for people with a longer-term investment horizon (3-5 years).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. I have no position in FedEx but might write an out of the money put option, as explained in this article."
1898001,52612,2013-12-13T14:53:45-05:00,,"It was probably unbeknown to companies in the courier business that their package delivery services would one day have such an elevated role and become an integral part of e-commerce development. Needless to say, without timely delivery of customer orders, the benefits of online shopping cannot be fully received by customers. Thus, as e-commerce continues to grow, so should package delivery companies that directly serve and support it.But the courier industry is rather fragmented with a wide range of service providers, big and small, focusing on different business areas that include services well beyond typical package delivery, such as long-haul freight service, things not directly tied to serving online merchants. To take advantage of the ongoing e-commerce growth, some couriers may have to realign their business with the kind of deliveries that online merchants need.This may well be the case for FedEx (NYSE:FDX) whose ground package delivery service, in terms of revenue, is less than 25% of the company's total business that also includes long-haul air courier service, less-than-truckload freight service and business office service, services that are outside typical package deliveries used by online merchants. Meanwhile, FedEx's closest competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS), the world's largest package delivery company, has most of its operations in small package deliveries that are very much e-commerce related, allowing the company to directly benefit from growing online shopping activities.As a result, UPS currently commands a much more favorable valuation than FedEx: more than 20 times equity book value for UPS stock vs. a mere 2.5 times equity book value for FedEx stock. Even at about one-fourth of the book equity size of FedEx, UPS is able to achieve a market capitalization twice the size of that for FedEx. Investors likely have accounted for the positive effect that e-commerce has had on UPS' package delivery business, while holding off endorsements on FedEx because of its current lack of a direct tie of its package delivery business with e-commerce activities. In addition, UPS' return on equity of more than 25% as compared to less than 10% for FedEx seems to reaffirm such a valuation bias.Admittedly, FedEx is trying to work on some profit improvement plan and has authorized a share repurchase program, all aimed at boosting earnings and shareholder returns. It makes sense that given FedEx's relatively low stock valuation and the potential growth in its future e-commerce-related package deliveries, big-name investors, including Paulson and Soros, have recently amassed considerable stakes in FedEx. It's a rare opportunity for investors as they can still find such a quality company like FedEx at this stage of the e-commerce development. Having not actively involved in serving the e-commerce market, FedEx can still capture the continuing growth in package deliveries when demand for courier services from online merchants likely remains strong.Another reason that FedEx can still get into the swing of e-commerce package deliveries is that the package delivery market is mostly composed of small couriers, if not counting UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. It's surprising that there hasn't been a nascent, specialized courier emerging out of the rising demand of package delivery services by countless online merchants. Thus, there could be even opportunities for FedEx to consolidate the market to make it less fragmented and provide online merchants more streamlined delivery services.Because of the lack of service uniformity and standards by package delivery companies, with each operating in their own niches, many online merchants, as well as brick and mortar stores with online operations, have to set up their own delivery fleets. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), for example, in a bid to get products faster to customers, has implemented a delivery service called eBay Now, which promises delivery within an hour. Getting no help from existing package delivery companies, eBay has to hire its own individual couriers running through local city streets.Similar to what eBay aspires to with its local express delivery, intra-city package deliveries in general may hold the most promise in the growth of courier business, as online merchants are more likely to sell merchandises through their regional fulfillment centers or local chain stores to avoid costly long-distance deliveries. Traditionally focusing on long-haul services with the largest fleet of cargo planes, FedEx has yet to craft a more compatible business model to realign its courier services better with the needs for local deliveries from many online merchants. If FedEx decides to expand its current Ground Package System, it can certainly leverage its enormous logistic capability as an established courier and find its rightful place in the still fragmented package delivery market.Some companies are deservedly cheap, meaning that their underperforming business, coupled with no growth potential, justifies their low valuation. But other companies may be unfairly undervalued, especially when growth opportunities clearly exist. FedEx belongs to the latter. With well-known activist investors taking large stakes in the company, one can reasonably expect that FedEx is about to make certain business changes to help increase its valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1866741,25047,2013-11-27T14:10:38-05:00,,"I've once compared UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to the railroads, and online retailers to the coal miners. This comparison stemmed from the fact that while there are thousands of online retailers, all of them have to ship their wares through a very limited set of shippers. Much like there are many coal mines, but for each there is usually a single railroad, which can take its product to the market.This lopsided situation gives the shipping oligopoly a massively superior bargaining position. It ensures that the economics of the shippers will be decent over time and will allow them to capture most of the value created by online retailing. The one exception is the other oligopoly - paying processors, which mostly includes Visa, MasterCard, American Express and increasingly, PayPal.While conceptually the above thesis - that shippers will capture the value - is easy to understand, one could ask more specifically where the proof is of that happening. Just this week, UPS again provided us with the answer: The proof is in the pricing power.Pricing power, or price elasticity of demand, tells us how much a company can increase prices while still maintaining sales volume. This is an easy concept to absorb. If Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) increases the price on any of the products it sells, the sales plunge. Amazon.com has seen it happen on very minor moves, for instance the Kindle Fire HDX is selling poorly in 2013 because it's priced slightly higher ($229) than the Kindle Fire HD was the previous year ($199), even though it's a superior product. UPS and FedEx, on the other hand, increase prices regularly and yet see no volume implosion. That's pricing power.This is what the price increases have looked like over the last 8 years at UPS (Source: BofA Merrill Lynch):And obviously, it's not just UPS. FedEx and DHL Express matched the increases. This is what pricing power looks like. Contrast it with the online retailers always in the cut-throat business of having to have the lowest possible price. Over time, this pricing power assures that the shipping business is a much superior business for investors.The one threatThere is basically one threat to UPS and FedEx in what concerns pricing power. That threat is the fact that both face an uneconomic player, USPS, also delivering packages. USPS is able to run at a deep deficit and stay afloat, and that puts downward pressure on what UPS and FedEx can charge to deliver the same thing. While UPS and FedEx have convenience advantages, there is only so much premium both can charge before customers start shifting volume towards USPS - much like Amazon.com is already doing where it can though implying a customer service penalty.ConclusionEach year that passes, the shippers reinforce the very obvious fact that if there's value to be captured in online retail, it will be captured by them (and the payment processors). This fact is illustrated in the massive pricing power the shippers have, where they increase prices consistently year after year without losing volume.The shippers are an obvious choice to buy in any economic slowdown, as their activity would be temporarily impacted yet their superior market position would probably remain the same.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Dan Loeb's Third Point reported a stake of two million shares which were purchased during the third quarter of 2013. Over the last three month alone FedEx shares have risen 27% and are up 55% over a one-year period.Compared to other air freight companies in the sector, FDX is the best performing stock with a plus of 75% over the most recent two-year period. United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is up 50%, Expeditors International of Washington (NASDAQ:EXPD) gained 6% and CH Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) lost 11%.Decent Q1 2014FedEx's first quarter results presented in September were quite solid and gave the shares tailwinds. Revenues increased 2% to $11 billion vs. $10.8 billion last year. Q1 2014 diluted EPS stood at $1.53 compared to $1.45 in Q1 2013 (a plus of 6%). Similarly, operating income jumped to $795 million vs. $742 million for the same period last year (an increase of 7%).FedEx also reaffirmed its 2014 EPS guidance and underlying macro assumptions:I am slightly more optimistic about the US economy and believe strong global growth is ahead of us. The US is still digging itself slowly out of the ditch while China is taking a breather. Higher global growth will materially benefit the international freight operations of FedEx. In this scenario, EPS outperformance is a strong possibility which could give further justification for valuation growth.Market valuationThe peer group consisting of air delivery and freight services companies has an average P/E ratio of 18.93. FedEx demands a P/E ratio of 15.64 and is the cheapest large-cap, international freight services provider in the peer group. However, a multiple of nearly 16 is clearly indicating fair value territory and I see limited room for multiple expansion from this point. UPS and CH Robinson Worldwide have P/E ratios close to the P/E average. Expeditors International fetches a valuation of 22 times forward earnings.The air freight services sector does not lend itself to income investors. Valuations have quite increased over the last 24 months and rising share prices have led to low dividend yields. Accelerating share price gains for FedEx over the last month are mainly attributable to investors reacting to news that hedge fund manager Dan Loeb initiated a FedEx position in the third quarter. As a result, FedEx currently pays a negligible dividend yield of 0.44%.A summary table with the most relevant valuation- and dividend metrics for the air delivery and freight services sector is provided below:ConclusionFedEx is an air freight and delivery company which appears to be fairly valued on its current earnings picture. Improving economic conditions, which I think will materialize over the next 2-3 years, will likely have an outsized effect on FedEx's per share earnings growth. I also estimate that valuation increases will come from stronger international earnings rather than multiple expansion.Investors who seek exposure to a cyclical company whose earnings benefit when the economy gains momentum, might want to consider FedEx. Shareholders also have renowned investors like Soros, Loeb and Paulson on their side who have demonstrated their stock picking skills in the past. Long-term BUY on possible EPS outperformance, cyclical exposure to the economy and strong activist presence in the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1837812,23263,2013-11-13T18:33:00-05:00,,"Hedge fund titan Dan Loeb is buying into FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS (NYSE:UPS) trading at an all-time high. The parcel delivery business is strongly back in fashion among investors. But, as of now, these two giants are all but absent from the world's largest and fastest-growing delivery market, China.The Chinese government, for now, has mainly shut them out, allowing domestic Chinese companies, in particular one called Shunfeng Express, to grow from start-up to giants in less than a decade.FedEx and UPS will need to find ways to grow in China. The opportunity there is truly outsized. Let me explain.China is modeling itself after the wrong part of the American economy. The money, the rhetoric and the policies are all focused on trying to replicate America's lead in high-technology and innovation. Instead, China would be long-term much better off and its citizens enjoy immediate higher living standards if it copied something far more mundane from the US, its distribution and logistics. If China's $9 trillion economy has an Achilles Heel, this is it. It simply costs too much to get things into consumers' hands.Wholesale layer is piled onto wholesale layer, with margin and fees extracted at every step. Fixers, expediters, overlookers all take a cut. Trucks are too small, tolls too high, warehouses too small and road traffic too congested in major cities. Commercial and retail rents are high, relative to per capita income level. In China, there is enough ""friction"" in every retail transaction to start a bonfire.Logistical costs and bottlenecks are the single biggest reason why so many goods made in China are sold at higher prices than in the US. This has more real-world consequences for average Chinese consumers than the level of the dollar-Renminbi exchange rate. It is logistics costs, all the stickiness and expense of getting products to market, that is most to blame for holding back the buying power, and so spending impulses, of Chinese consumers. Middlemen live well in China. Consumers less so.It is cheaper, in many cases, to get a product made in China onto a container ship in Shanghai, offload it in Long Beach, truck it across the US, and then stock it on a shelf at a Wal-Mart in Georgia then it is to put the same product in front of Chinese consumers in a Wal-Mart in China. High taxes don't help. China's VAT, applied to most things sold at retail, is set at a higher level than most sales taxes in the US. Another factor: retail competition as Americans know it is also largely absent in China. Stores don't compete much on price in China. Wal-Mart won't say, but it's a fair assumption its margins in China are at least double those in the US.But, high consumer prices in China are mainly the product of the high handling charges. A simple example. I eat a lot of fruit. Most fresh fruit grown in China costs as much or more in supermarkets here than the same fruit grown and sold in the US.Apples sell for around Rmb 6 (95 cents) per pound and up in China. The apple farmer gets around Rmb 1 per pound. The rest is liberally spread among all those standing between the apple tree and my mouth.Adjusted for purchasing power, Chinese average income levels are around 1/6th the US's. So, that Chinese apple sells for equivalent, in US terms, of $6 a pound. That amounts to a lot of money per apple being shared by people other than the grower and the eater. How much? Chinese eat a lot of apples. In fact, almost half of all apples grown in the world are eaten in China, ten times more than total US consumption.I met the boss of one of China's largest apple shipping and packaging companies. Outside of China, this is a razor-thin margin business. But the Chinese apple packer and shipper has profit margins well above 10%.One of the most expensive links in the Chinese domestic supply chain are road tolls. China's are among the most costly, per kilometer traveled, anywhere in the world. Trucks carrying agricultural products don't pay tolls. Anything else moving along China's highway system pays full freight. Depending where you are in the country, tolls run as high as 25 cents a mile for passenger cars. Trucks pay triple that. It all, of course, ends up being passed along to consumers.To amortize the tolls, truckers overload their vehicles. This burns more fuel, degrades roadways (justifying still higher tolls), and makes loading and unloading more time-consuming and more costly. According to the boss of a large long-distance shipping company I talked to, his trucks are routinely pulled over by traffic police and made to pay various on-the-spot fines. This can double the amount paid in tolls.Everything about the logistics industry in China acts as a sponge soaking up consumers' cash. The one exception: Shunfeng Express （顺 丰快递）. Little known outside China, Shunfeng Express is China's most successful private shipping and delivery company. It alone proves that logistics in China don't need to be wasteful, expensive and inefficient.Shunfeng is modeled after Fedex, DHL and UPS, but operates on a scale, and at prices, that would be unimaginable to these global giants. Shunfeng is a secretive outfit. Not much is publicly disclosed. The founder lives in Hong Kong, but comes originally from the mainland. It was started in 1993, and according to some media reports, its net income in 2010 Rmb 13 billion ($2.1 billion). That may be a stretch, but Shunfeng is doing a lot right and deserves whatever profit it keeps.Shunfeng picks up and delivers documents, packages and some bulk freight between cities in China. It charges a fraction of what Fedex or UPS do in the US. These US companies are mainly prohibited to operate in China's domestic delivery market. I'm not sure they'd be so eager. For next-day document delivery within a city, Shunfeng charges under $2. Delivery to other cities: $3. If you want to move a few kilos of freight, Shunfeng not only ships it, but will come and package it for you. That part is free. The shipping usually works out to less than $5 a kilo.One of the main reasons Alibaba's Taobao has become so successful in China is that Shunfeng ships Taobao purchases cheaply and efficiently across China. Taobao, which operates like a cross between Amazon Marketplace and eBay, will likely facilitate transactions worth around USD$100 billion this year. A lot of that will get shipped and delivered by Shunfeng.They have an army of delivery guys. Most larger office buildings in major cities have one permanently stationed inside. You call for a pickup and the Shunfeng guy arrives within minutes. Most letters and packages get moved around by either electric motorcycle or jet. It leases its own aircraft to fly stuff around within China.Shunfeng doesn't do cross-country trucking. This is one big reason Shunfeng are so efficient and so cheap. Anything that moves by truck in China is going to have multiple hands in the till, and so end up costing consumers too much.Shunfeng has achieved its massive scale and now well-known brand in China without raising capital from the stock market, or bringing in outside professional investors until three months ago. There are few private companies in China I admire more, and who are doing more to benefit the average consumer in China. I wish I could invest. For the good of every consumer in China, Shunfeng should continue to grow, continue to expand the range of what it handles in China. At the same time, UPS and FedEx need to find ways to expand, quickly, in China. This will all do a lot to unstick China's logistical logjam.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1773932,38201,2013-10-25T11:25:27-04:00,,"In our last report on FedEx (FDX), we estimated the company's EPS for the end of the present fiscal to be $5.25, which is 7.1% year-over-year growth. Our growth projection didn't involved any share repurchase activity by FedEx. The company is easily achieving its EPS growth target of 7% to 13% without making any share repurchases. However, FedEx is consistently repurchasing shares, which can lead to consistent capital returns to shareholders.In October 2013, FedEx announced plans to buyback 32 million shares, subject to market conditions. This will be an addition to its existing repurchase program, which has a remaining authorization of 7.4 million shares. FedEx's consistent share repurchase activities indicate that it wants to ensure consistent returns to shareholders.The 32 million share buyback will form 10% of the company's 316 million outstanding shares. Historically FedEx hasn't been an aggressive buyer of its shares, so this indicates that it has plans to give considerable returns to its shareholders. Apart from share repurchases, FedEx is making a considerable change to the pricing policy for its FedEx Express segment to grab more customers.Announcement of flat-rate shippingFedEx has efforts to reach individuals and small businesses, so it announced a flat-rate shipping option on October 21, 2013, which will start on November 1, 2013 in the U.S. This one-rate option will help FedEx's Express air-shipping unit compete with the U.S. Postal Service's Priority Mail Flat Rate.This service will boost FedEx's express segment, which witnessed just 2.4% growth in its topline, year over year, in the last quarterly results. Prior to this service, FedEx charged by a combination of weight and distance traveled. In addition to this, surcharges for fuel and other items also prevailed, which used to complicate the pricing.With introduction of FedEx one-rate, more packaging options will be available to customers; five new boxes will be added to the present line of free packaging along with a new extra-large size category. This will lead to a total of 12 packing options for the express shipping services. After choosing the appropriate size, the customer will have to pay a flat rate for each package with respect to destination. This will facilitate customers to take benefit of simply-priced options for the distance covered in shipping.The one-rate option will facilitate domestic shipments for overnight, 2-day and 3-day shipping in the U.S. Moreover the pricing will also include value added services like tracking capabilities, customer service, and a money-back guarantee. The company won't require an additional charge for a stated value of $100. FedEx already has 36,500 drop box locations, which will facilitate customers to drop off their respective one-rate shipments at those locations.We expect that this new service will enhance the company's topline since it will offer more packaging alternatives, simplification of pricing options, online order placement, and timely deliveries. This will also benefit FedEx with new customer acquisitions, which used to find FedEx's Express services a bit expensive.The company riding high on investor's confidenceAs per the present share repurchase program, FedEx will repurchase the shares time to time through privately negotiated transactions in the open market. The continuous share repurchase activity can guarantee short term rally in a stock, but investors should be cautious, since the buyback can be financed through debt if the company doesn't generate sufficient cash. Financing the repurchase through debt will mean trading of one type of liability for another. We will now discuss the cash flows generated by FedEx as compared to its peers, which will give us an idea of the company's liquidity position.From the above table, we can easily infer that FedEx's trailing twelve month, or TTM, price to cash flow is lower than United Parcel Service (UPS) and C.H. Robinson (CHRW). FedEx's price to cash flow is even lower than the S&P 500. So, we can say quite comfortably that FedEx's cash generation ability is better than the two prominent players in the air delivery and freight industry. Moreover, its liquidity position is also strong compared to the S&P 500 industrial average.Its debt to equity ratio also stands lowest compared to UPS and C.H. Robinson, which suggests that FedEx's creditworthiness is quite high. FedEx doesn't need to depend on debt to fund the share repurchase. The company had a cash balance of $5.09 billion in last quarter results ended in August 2013, and it requires around $4 billion to fund the new 32 million share repurchase according to present share prices. So we can say that FedEx is in a comfortable position to make the share repurchase.FedEx had 317 million outstanding shares as on September 30, 2013, after repurchasing 2.8 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. We can say the company has been moving to return value to shareholders from the start of the present fiscal year. The capital returns witnessed by FedEx since the start of the present fiscal are given below:FDX data by YChartsFrom the above chart, we can infer that FedEx has given capital returns of around 54% in the last year. Further, FedEx's consistent share repurchase announcement has complemented the stock returns. The stock jumped by 4.1% after the announcement of the new share repurchase program. This was the highest increase the stock had witnessed since February 2007.ConclusionFedEx's new flat-rate pricing system will benefit the customers since this will provide better services at an affordable cost. Moreover, it will benefit the highest contributing segment of FedEx.Apart from this, FedEx's consistent repurchase program will complement the strong fundamentals of the company. Moreover, its cash generation ability will help the company to continue with shareholder friendly policies. So, we recommend a buy on FedEx with a long term horizon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1729752,38201,2013-10-04T15:38:21-04:00,,"FedEx (FDX) is known for making constant share buybacks to achieve its EPS targets. It made share repurchases in the last quarter, and it can continue to do so, since it still has to buyback 7.4 million out of 10.0 million shares as per the share repurchase program started in March 2013. A big question is whether the company actually needs to repurchase shares to achieve its EPS target.Apart from what lies ahead with share repurchase, another area of interest is the company's FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost segments, which are its shipping divisions. These sectors cumulatively witnessed the highest operating margin of 17% amongst all FedEx's operating segments in the last quarter. With a promising operating margin, can both the segments drive FedEx's topline?Expecting a better result from most profitable segmentsFedEx's ground and smartpost segment generated revenue of $2.73 billion in the recent quarterly results, witnessing an 11% rise year over year. The major reason behind this revenue growth was the continued growth in home deliveries and commercial business services.Apart from this, FedEx SmartPost individually witnessed a 26% rise year over year in its average daily volume in the last quarter results. This segment specializes in low weight and less time sensitive consumer package business. Since both are shipping services, FedEx SmartPost revenue is included in FedEx Ground.The company expects that earnings and revenue growth will continue in the present quarter driven by FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost. FedEx generated around 24.5% of its total revenue from these two segments in the last quarter. FedEx mentioned that it will continue to make capital expenditures in the ground segment, and 90% of the capital expenditure allocated toward the ground segment would be to expand capacity and build new hubs.Let's compare FedEx Ground with its biggest competitor, United Parcel Service (UPS).Source: FedEx roadshow August, 2013FedEx has the upper hand compared to UPS in the ground segment since it has faster lanes than UPS, offering faster transit. It also gives us an indication that FedEx has developed better infrastructure for the ground segment than UPS. In the last three years, FedEx improved the transit times by more than 50% by developing its city to city shipping lanes. We expect that FedEx will continue to develop its lanes since it allocates a good sum of money toward capital expenditure in the ground segment.The growing e-commerce business also supplemented the topline growth for FedEx SmartPost. Online retail sales were estimated to be around $225.5 billion in 2012 in the U.S., and it is expected to reach $434.2 billion in 2017. To harness this growth, FedEx has already developed e-commerce facilities in the form of electronic shipping tools and development of its FedEx ship manager application. Such developments will also benefit the FedEx ground segment. The company expects growing online retail sales will drive the revenue for FedEx Ground since it has already noticed the impact in the average daily volume for the segment.Let's have a look at the average daily volume from FedEx Ground:Source SEC Filings of the companyThe average daily volume, or ADV, for FedEx Ground has been growing at an average of 2.6%. Moreover, the ADV of FedEx SmartPost is growing at an average of 7.1% over the same period. Considering a scenario where the ADV of FedEx Ground increases at the same rate for the present quarter, then the average daily volume for FedEx Ground will be 4,428,000 packages. Applying the same methodology, the average daily volume for FedEx SmartPost will be 224,100 packages.If the revenue for the quarter increases at the same rate as the increase in ADV, then we can expect revenue of $2.81 billion for both FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost combined. This will lead to an increase of 3% in the segment's revenue quarter over quarter. So according to our analysis, the segment will continue to ensure topline growth for FedEx.Is it required to make further share repurchases to achieve the EPS targetFedEx plans to achieve an EPS growth target of 7% to 13% year over year in the present fiscal year. The company is already active in achieving this target, since it repurchased 2.82 million shares in the last quarter, which led to cash outflow of $277.76 million. This repurchase raised the EPS to $1.54 for the quarter, a 5.5% rise year over year. This share repurchase didn't significantly increase FedEx's EPS; without the repurchase, EPS would have been $1.53 for the quarter.If the company completes the current repurchase program, then it will lead to a cash outflow of $870 million. Does the company really require the repurchase plan to meet its EPS guidance?The company's net earnings grew at an average rate of 13.38% in the last three fiscal results. Even if the company achieves half of this earnings growth, it can witness net income of $1.66 billion, resulting in an EPS of $5.25 by the end of the present fiscal without additional share repurchases. This would lead to 7.1% EPS growth by the fiscal end. So according to our analysis, the company can achieve its EPS target without making any share repurchase, but if its EPS target changes to a higher estimate, then it may require the share repurchase.ValuationA close analysis of FedEx and its peers, which include UPS and C.H. Robinson (CHRW).Source: Yahoo financeFedEx is ahead of its peers regarding generation of revenue with respect to enterprise value. Moreover, from the profitability front, the company is generating the highest EBITDA with respect to enterprise value in comparison to its peers. Apart from these two indicators, FedEx's long-term growth also seems highest when considering P/E since its PEG ratio is also the lowest. We can infer that the company may outperform since its valuation seems attractive in comparison to its peers.ConclusionWe have considerable expectations that FedEx Ground will ensure topline growth for FedEx, and the segment will increase its share of the company's overall revenue. If any segment reports diminishing revenue for FedEx, it can offset this with the higher revenue growth from the ground segment.Based on our EPS estimates, we can say that company can generate enough profits to achieve its EPS target. We believe the company's action plans are enough to ensure both topline growth and achieve its EPS growth target of 7% to 13%, so we recommend a buy for the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1697532,24491,2013-09-17T03:38:45-04:00,,"Hedgeye recently called for investors to buy FedEx on the dip. But should they? Let's get a second opinion on the intrinsic value of FedEx (NYSE:FDX).At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Please see how we rate firms below as it relates to both their intrinsic value and their technical/momentum indicators.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. FedEx posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare FedEx to peers CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW), UTI Worldwide (NASDAQ:UTIW), and United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS).Our Report on FedExInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 12.2% during the past three years.• FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services. The company operates under various segments including: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, and FedEx Services• FedEx's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• FedEx's long-term financial goals are as follows: 1) achieve 10% operating margin; 2) increase EPS 10%-15% per year; 3) grow profitable revenue; 4) improve cash flows; 5) increase ROIC; 6) and increase the dividend. We like management's focus.• E-commerce and global trade growth continue to drive increased demand for FedEx's services. FedEx Express is becoming more efficient, FedEx Ground is gaining share, and FedEx Freight margins are rebounding.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.5%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 54% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 42% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $105 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 16.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6.2 times last year's EBITDA. We're not seeing much of an opportunity here. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.6%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $105 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $79 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $131 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $105 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $141 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $105 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1701282,41821,2013-09-18T13:12:13-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) was trading up 2.5% in pre-market trading on Wednesday morning, following quarterly earnings and revenue that both beat analyst expectations.FedEx is one of the world's largest courier/shipping companies and most well-known name brands; it draws annual revenues of $43 billion from numerous services and products under the FedEx name. Aside from shipping, FedEx runs FedEx Office, shipping and copying retail stores that the company acquired when it bought Kinko's in February 2004.The purpose of this article is going to be to review FedEx's quarterly report, and present an argument as to why I believe FedEx will continue to be a lucrative investment going forward.Here's how FedEx has fared in its last five quarters of reporting earnings:FedEx has been a lucrative investment for traders over the last year, yielding 31.1% in the last twelve months and an impressive 14% in the last three months alone. (Click to enlarge)As you can see, FDX has traded well from a technical standpoint over the last six months, as well. The RSI indication shows that the stock has neither been overbought nor oversold during that time period, and that the sustained uptrend appears to be a healthy one.For the quarter ending August 2013, FedEx reported profit of $1.53/share ($489 million), up from $1.45/share ($459 million) the year prior. In addition, revenue was $11.02 billion for the quarter, rising 2.1% and beating analyst expectations of $10.97 billion.Also this morning, FedEx confirmed their forecast for full year earnings growth of 7% to 13% and that they ""expected $4 billion in capital spending for fiscal 2014"".FedEx has been following through on the restructuring that it said it was going to put in place last year. It consists mainly of updating their airline fleet and restructuring their express and ground segments.In addition, FedEx is working on continuing to grow its FedEx Ground segment, a segment that has produced roughly $10 billion in revenue last year. FedEx Ground is a ground delivery service that FedEx started officially in the year 2000. The purpose of FedEx Ground was to expand the company from its well known express routes, and tap into the ground shipping game that United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and the USPS were both dominating. Since then, FedEx has found significant success with FedEx Ground.FedEx has the ability to ship to and reach over 200 countries worldwide, and international shipping also generates significant revenue for the company; about $9 billion in 2012 alone. In order to continue to grow this segment, FedEx is expanding its processing and storage facilities worldwide.One primary risk that FedEx faces is the rising cost of oil, as fuel for its trucks and airliners make up a significant amount of cost that the company has to bear. The company uses over 700 planes and tens of thousands of trucks, according a report by NPR. The company has considerable resources that use fossil fuels, and as crude continues to rise - as it's expected to do through 2014 - it could present a challenge for FedEx. (Click to enlarge)However, it was reported by NPR that FedEx's CEO, Fred Smith, is acutely focused on trying to find solutions to the petroleum barrier:Smith's plan includes betting on hybrid and electric vehicles, as well as adding biofuels and natural gas to the mix. This type of forward thinking is going to be crucial for FedEx to address costs going forward, and I'm excited that FedEx has started looking at solutions in 2012/2013 and not waiting until it becomes a significant problem for the company.FedEx is a great buy now, because it's easily the quickest growing company, when compared to UPS and the USPS - it's two main competitors. In addition, FDX's stock price has appreciated every year dating back to 2001, generally at a rate of about 5% or above each year. Competitors like UPS and DHL (OTCPK:DPSTF) have found inconsistent growth - in UPS' cases a rough period between 2007 and 2010, and in DHL's case, continual decline since the early 2000's.As I stated in my last article about Ford (NYSE:F), dividends are just lovely. They're like little security blankets for investors that choose to place their money in certain equities. Dividends in the market remain the best loyalty program companies have implemented since casinos started handing out vats of whiskey, buffet tickets & free rooms simply for handing over your hard earned money directly to them.As FedEx continues to grow, their dividend is growing with it. Although not competitive with the dividends of competitors like UPS, yet, the consistent raise shows that FedEx is doing the right thing for shareholders and continuing to make their stock appealing to potential investors. (Click to enlarge)It has been years of significant and rapid growth for FedEx, all based from their one original segment - its express services. The name ""FedEx"", like ""Google"" is so synonymous with express mailing, people say they're simply ""going to FedEx something"" the way people now say they're ""going to Google it"".One of the things that I look for in any company is a non-saturated market that is ripe for the expansion. Two companies I've written about this year - Natural Gas Services (NYSE:NGS) and Kona Grill (KONA) were attractive to me due to the amount of expansion potential they had.FedEx has this same opportunity as they continue to penetrate into the ground shipping market - still dominated primarily by UPS and USPS. There has even been speculation that as the USPS downsizes, they may begin to privatize certain segments; this has led to extremely speculative, yet not out of the question, theories about a FedEx/USPS partnership.Combining ground with the amount of expansion that FedEx could take on internationally - namely by adding infrastructure overseas in China and other countries - and FedEx still clearly has a lot of room to grow. In conjunction with these factors, the company's forward thinking and the safety blanket of a dividend, FedEx is very likely to continue to deliver for investors going forward. As always, best of luck to all investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1527102,24491,2013-06-28T15:28:01-04:00,,"Shipping powerhouse FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported better than anticipated fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $11.4 billion, roughly in-line with consensus estimates. However, adjusted earnings per share climbed 7% year-over-year to $2.13, easily exceeding consensus expectations. This ""beat"" came after the company reduced its guidance in the preceding quarter, so we still do not believe results were that great. Still, the firm did an effective job of lowering capital spending, so full-year free cash flow increased 59% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Volumes for the year were also light, with average daily shipments falling 1% year-over-year in the US and with international export volumes increasing only 3%.FedEx's Express segment showed marginal sequential improvement during the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 3% year-over-year to $7 billion, compared to 2% revenue growth in the prior quarter. Thanks to several successful cost-control initiatives, adjusted operating income jumped 11% year-over-year to $460 million. The US performed reasonably well, with volumes 2% higher than a year ago and price-per-pound up 1%. On top of solid domestic results, the company announced that it inked a 7-year, $10.5 billion deal (with revenue upside) with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to handle airline-haul traffic. Although the deal is worth less than the prior arrangement, we think the agreement strengthens FedEx's relationship with the troubled department. Given the current state of the USPS and political environment, we could see some reductions in the size of the postal system, leaving FedEx and competitors such as UPS (NYSE:UPS) with the opportunity to help shoulder the burden.Meanwhile, FedEx Ground continues to show strong performance, with revenue up 12% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. The Ground business capitalized on e-commerce growth, which drove volumes 10% higher year-over-year during the fourth quarter. FedEx's SmartPost business, which leverages FedEx's transportation infrastructure and the USPS' daily routes for quick-shipping, posted a whopping 25% increase in shipping volumes. Though the segment's revenue remains a fraction of the Express business, we believe Ground is FedEx's growth engine. More efficient e-commerce distribution networks are dictating a shift in shipping modes, and companies continue to avoid more expensive methods like FedEx Express.Looking ahead, the company provided lackluster fiscal year 2014 guidance. Management expects US GDP growth is expected to tally just 2.3%, while world GDP growth is just a touch better at 2.7%. Earnings per share are expected to increase 7%-13% during the year, but management anticipates capital spending in the $4 billion range. It seems as though the company spared free cash flow in fiscal year 2013 by pushing purchases into fiscal year 2014. As such, we think free cash flow will be slightly lower in fiscal year 2014.Valuentum's TakeFedEx lowered the hurdle twice in fiscal year 2013, so we are somewhat skeptical of the firm's preliminary guidance for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 wasn't a great year for FedEx, but free cash flow was strong, and the company continues to experience fantastic growth in its Ground business. FedEx is a strong company, but we think it needs more robust economic growth to achieve better earnings expansion. Therefore, we aren't interested in adding shares to the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter at this time, nor do we see much value in the sector.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1677632,38201,2013-09-06T09:53:46-04:00,,"The U.S. benchmark index Dow Jones registered 40% returns in the last two years, but three major airfreight companies underperformed the market standard during the same duration. However, there are promising growth prospects for these companies, since they are expanding in developing countries, e-commerce, and technological advancements. Let's analyze these companies to find investment opportunities for the investors.Bigger, the betterFedEx (FDX) has partnered with around 9,000 small business units across the U.S. and Canada for delivering shipments, and it generated revenue of around $10 billion under its FedEx ground segment in the last fiscal year. The company will expand this model to other states in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2014, as its services are quick and reliable. FedEx delivers 61% of packages in two days or less, due to its efficiently managed facilities. The company has advanced automated systems that can sort 7,500 packages per hour. Moreover, it has 31 sorting facilities in the U.S. and Canada to manage its operations in this region. By increasing its footprint and employing latest technology, FedEx will be able to grow its FedEx ground segment revenue by around 8% in this fiscal.FedEx generated around $8.8 billion last year from its international priority package shipments under its FedEx express segment. The company has a wide reach; it caters to around 220 countries with its strong distribution network and advanced technology. In the last decade, Asian countries emerged as growing contributors in global trade due to increased exports and imports from emerging countries like China, India, and South Korea. To tap this growth, the company is planning to launch a new sorting facility in Japan by 2014 as it has smoother connectivity between Asia and American continents. Furthermore, to monetize the volume growth and maximize the capacity utilization, the company is planning to buy multiple Boeing's 777F in line with what it bought in 2010. FedEx is hoping to have around 22 of these planes in service by next year, and will add 16 more by 2020. The 777F has more space and capacity to carry more goods at a time. FedEx can use this capacity efficiently reach customers with ease. These cargo planes travel around 6,600 miles in one flight, enabling customers to send parcels from the U.S. to Asia, or vise-a-versa, in a single day. We assume bigger cargo planes will help it capitalize on growth opportunities in Asia with the additional capacity. Considering these factors, we believe FedEx will able to generate higher revenue from its international priority segment in the coming years.Banking on Asia and e-commerce marketPackage volume is expected to grow in the U.S. as a result of economic recovery in past few quarters and increased consumer spending. United Parcel Services (UPS) generated around $23 billion in the last year from its domestic ground operations in the U.S., and this revenue is expected to rise further due to the increasing U.S. e-commerce market. The U.S. e-commerce market was $225 billion last year and is expected to grow around 12% this year. Also, the North American e-commerce market is expected to surge from $373 billion last year to $420 billion this year. UPS has focused service like ""Surepost"", which caters to the growing e-commerce market with ease. With the help of this service, shippers and receivers can track orders online, and it is more reliable and consistent than any other service available on the market. This service is ideal for the business to customer, or B2C, market where this kind of smoothness is essential. We assume that UPS will benefit from the surging e-commerce market with its unique services.In the second quarter result of 2013, UPS revenue grew by 1.2% year over year to $13.5 billion, and it posted an increase of 5% in the international daily package volume. The company is leveraging its market position in Asia with the launch of a new direct flight from Zhengzhou, China to South Korea last year. Zhengzou is a major hub for exports in China, and it exports to Europe and the U.S. Goods exported from Zhengzou will reach in the U.S. via the air route to South Korea, which has smooth connectivity. China's government is also promoting Zhengzou to increase trade and is taking developmental initiatives. The government approved the Central Plains Economic Zone last year for this city, which will increase the logistics and infrastructural development. With this, UPS also launched new express freight services in China to cater customers that have urgent, time sensitive delivery requirements. By leveraging its market position in this country, we assume that UPS will able to increase its volume, which will result in higher revenue.Growing import and exportsExpeditors International (EXPD) is a leading global player in logistics and offers solutions in shipments and logistical support to various businesses. The company's revenue improved 10% from $83.96 million last year to $92.32 million this year. The company's revenue in airfreight segment marginally increased 0.7%, while revenue of ocean freight and services dropped 5.2% in the same period. We feel Expeditors' revenue will rise further in the second half of this fiscal year due to a flurry of new technological product launches. Many silicon-valley companies will roll out new products in the second of this fiscal year, and there will be a rise of demand of these consumer goods. It is expected that launch of Apple's new iPhone, Sony's PlayStation, and various other technological products will increase U.S. exports this year. In June 2013, this region registered export growth of around 5.6% year over year, so it is already showing an inclining trend. We believe that the rise in exports of these consumer goods and dominant market positions of Expeditors will help its revenue continue to grow since it caters to these customers through its different channels.A rise in consumer spending is a sign of improving economy, and the U.S. is currently experiencing this recovery. With these developments and an increasing consumer confidence index, import of goods through containers is expected to rise by 4.2% in the second half of the current fiscal year, which was estimated at 2% previously. Moreover, the entire trade lane is expected to experience growth due to increasing consumer demand. Trade lane refers to the logistical network by which goods are sent and received. With the increase in U.S. imports, Expeditors will have more goods to transport, which will increase the company's volume. Expeditors' volume declined in the first half of this fiscal year, but we expect that the trends will reverse this in the second half. We base our expectation on the optimism over U.S. imports since Expeditors has the capacity to transport through water and air with expertise. Therefore, Expeditors' EPS is also expected to increase by 13.36% in the next year.Valuations:FedEx has a PE of 21.78, which is lower than PE of both UPS and Expeditors. UPS and Expeditors stand at a PE of 99.51 and 24.58 respectively. Looking at this, we assume FedEx will outperform its competitors. However, UPS and Expeditors' fundamentals are strong, which will move their stocks upward. All three companies have an expected EPS growth rate of above 11% for the next fiscal year, which should give investors' confidence in regards to the growth of these stocks. Considering these factors, we recommend a ""buy"" for all three stocks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1713162,42201,2013-09-25T14:24:03-04:00,,"Year to date, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is up more than 25%. Despite the higher price per share, I still believe FDX is a good stock for dividend growth investors. In this article, I will be looking at FDX's cash flows, balance sheet, valuation and dividends. For comparison, I will be using United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)DividendsFDX's dividend yield at current prices is at 0.52%, which is quite low compared to UPS's 2.72%. However, I believe FDX's dividend has a good chance of going up, for these two reasons:-FDX's low dividend has allowed it to save up a very large sum of money. At the end of FY2013, FedEx had $4.9 billion in cash, or 13.5% of its total market cap. Its current assets have increased at a much higher rate than its current liabilities, causing the current ratio to reach 1.96 at the end of FY2013.ValuationAt 22.9 times earnings, FedEx looks very expensive. Between 2010 and 2012, the average price to earnings ratio was at 17.4. However, analysts expect FDX to reach EPS of $6.98 in fiscal year 2014, and $8.69 in 2015, which means the stock is now selling for 16.4 times expected earnings in 2014 (the current fiscal year) and only 13.2 times the expected earnings in 2015. UPS is currently trading at $91.26, which is 16.7 times the expected earnings for the next fiscal year.ConclusionWhile at first glance the low dividend and relatively high price to earnings ratio makes FDX looks like a stock a dividend-orientated investor should avoid, a deeper look at the company makes it look very attractive. By paying a small dividend, FDX has managed to save up billions of dollars. The current dividend is only 13.5% of the free cash flow. Earnings were down in FY 2013, but are expected to grow by double digits in both the current fiscal year and next year. FedEx's first quarter for the current fiscal year ended a few days ago, with earnings per share of $1.53, 5.5% higher than in the first quarter of last year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1732582,24491,2013-10-07T13:47:04-04:00,,"Shipping goliath FedEx (NYSE:FDX) announced better-than-anticipated fiscal first quarter results. Revenue rose 2% year-over-year to $11 billion, slightly above consensus expectations. Earnings per share increased 5.5% year-over-year to $1.53 per share, also slightly above consensus estimates. Free cash flow was decent at $357 million, equal to 3.2% of total revenue.FedEx ExpressExpress revenue was roughly flat year-over-year at $6.61 billion, but segment operating income jumped 14% year-over-year to $236 million as the firm benefitted from 50 basis points of operating margin expansion. Management cited lower pension expenses and lower maintenance costs as the main drivers of earnings expansion in the face of flat top-line performance. This ends two consecutive quarters of top-line growth, but we remain very impressed with the pace of profitability expansion.FedEx GroundFedEx Ground continues to be the company's growth driver, as revenue surged 11% year-over-year to $2.73 billion (as average daily package volume jumped 11%). Though we think some revenue is being siphoned from the Express unit, we believe Ground shipping is a secular growth story that is advantageously exposed to the continued preference for e-commerce. Segment operating income was just 5% higher year-over-year at $468 million driving operating margins 100 basis points lower than the year-ago period at 17.1%. Management blamed the decline on rising fuel costs, as well as capital spending designed to increase the size of the firm's shipping network. CFO Alan Graf added that these initiatives are ""very high ROIC"" investments, which we view as an encouraging statement about cash flow generation in coming years.FedEx FreightOften an afterthought, FedEx Freight generated revenue of $1.42 billion, 2% higher than the same period in the year-prior period. Operating margins were flat year-over-year at 6.4%, so operating income was just $1 million higher at $91 million.GuidanceLooking ahead, management kept its previous guidance for fiscal year 2014 in place, though it lowered its GDP outlook for the US to 2.1% (was 2.3%) and the world to 2.6% (was 2.7%). Earnings-per-share is still expected to expand 7-13% on a year-over-year basis, while the firm spends $4 billion on capital investment. We think there is modest upside to the earnings forecast if US GDP growth accelerates and/or pricing initiatives don't lead to significant customer defections (FedEx Express will increase shipping rates 3.9% effective January 2014).Valuentum's TakeFedEx's fiscal first quarter certainly wasn't marked by strong top-line growth, but Express segment operating margin expansion and continued secular growth in Ground helped the firm achieve positive results. Though share performance has been strong (up nearly 29% year-to-date), we think shares of the shipping giant are currently fairly valued. For a highly cyclical business like FedEx, we demand a large margin of safety, and we do not believe the current valuation justifies a position in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1701672,25120,2013-09-18T15:26:17-04:00,,"Shares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) jumped up in Wednesday's trading session after the transportation giant reported first quarter results.The earnings report indicates that the company is on track with its plan to cut costs, thereby boosting earnings in the coming years.Despite the reasonably solid results, I remain on the sidelines based on the fair valuation and little appealing dividends.First Quarter ResultsFedEx generated first quarter revenues for its fiscal year of 2014 of $11.02 billion, up 2% on the year before. Revenues came in slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $11.00 billion.Net earnings rose by 7% to $489 million, as diluted earnings per share advanced to $1.53 per share. Earnings came in above consensus estimates of $1.50 per share as FedEx is making solid progress on its cost cutting efforts.Important for shareholders, FedEx remains focused and committed to improve operating profitability at its FedEx Express division. The company targets a $1.6 billion cumulative operating improvement through the end of the fiscal year of 2016. It is margin expansion at the Express division and continued growth in the Ground segment which should support and drive the future valuation of the company.A Look Into The ResultsThe large Express segment has shown some marked improvements. While revenues fell by 0.3% to $6.61 billion, profitability improved markedly. Operating income was up by 14% to $236 million as operating margins improved by 50 basis points to 3.6% of total revenues.Revenues were under pressure on lower fuel surcharges and one fewer operating day. International exports grew by 4% as economic packages where in demand, while priority mail was out of favor as customers opt for cheaper shipping options. Global customers are adjusting to the ""new normal"" and are happy to take delivery a few days later at much lower prices. Lower expansion expenses, job cuts and the modernization of the aircraft fleet should support a continued sustainable lower cost base.The hugely profitable Ground segment reported a solid 11% increase in revenues, which totaled $2.73 billion. Operating earnings rose by 5% to $468 million as operating margins fell by 100 basis points to 17.1% of total revenues. Notably home delivery and commercial deliveries rose, driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. FedEx is well positioned to benefit from new technology product introductions, as many consumers order tablets or other gadgets plus associated accessories online. Margins were under pressure on network expansion costs and one fewer operating day.The smaller Freight segment reported a 2% increase in volumes, totaling $1.42 billion. Operating income rose 1% to $91 million, resulting in steady operating margins of 6.4%.And The Remainder Of The YearFedEx sees full year earnings growth of 7 to 13% from last year's adjusted earnings. Key underlying assumptions for this outlook are current fuel prices and solid growth in US and global GDP. The exposure to the global and US economy is large, so is the exposure to world trade. The downside is that FedEx is already a large player in the market, making it difficult to ""outgrow"" the general world economy.The earnings guidance implies that earnings are expected to come in between $6.63 and $7.01 per share. Consensus estimates for full year earnings stood at $6.97 per share. Note that last year's earnings were heavily impacted by accelerated aircraft depreciation charges in the final quarter.FedEx Express will raise shipping rates by 3.9% in January of 2014, and it is still to be seen how customers will react to this. Ground and SmartPost price changes are not yet available, while the Freight division has increased rates by 4.5% in July of this year already. The effects of this has already been seen as many customers shifted toward cheaper delivery options.ValuationFedEx ended its first quarter with $5.10 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stood at $3.00 billion, for a net cash position of around $2.1 billion.FedEx is on track to generate annual revenues of around $45 billion for the fiscal year of 2014, on which it could earn some $2.1 billion in adjusted earnings.Factoring in gains of 2%, with shares exchanging hands at $114 per share, the market values FedEx at $36 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at some $34 billion, or 0.75 times annual revenues, and 17 times earnings.FedEx pays a very modest quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share for an annual dividend yield of 0.5%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term holders in FedEx have seen relative modest returns. While globalization and the emergence of e-commerce have boosted the business, shareholders have only benefited to some extent. Shares traded in a $100-$120 range between 2005-2007, to fall to lows in their mid-thirties by 2009.Following a steady recovery, shares have rallied back to $115 again, which means investors have not made any progress over the past 8 years. Dividend yields of 0.5% at the moment have been very modest as well.Between the fiscal year of 2009 and 2013, FedEx has grown annual revenues by a cumulative 28% to $44.3 billion. Earnings rose by 32% to $1.56 billion in the meantime.Investment ThesisThe company remains committed to its long-term profitability targets. The Express division is still committed to boost operating profits by a cumulative $1.6 billion by the end of the fiscal year of 2016. While the unit is by far the largest in terms of revenues, it lags in profit contributions despite margin improvements over the past quarter.Continued cost cutting efforts at this unit should bolster overall profitability as customers cut back from expensive airfreight shipping options, and fuel surcharges are under pressure. The star performer within the company remains the ground business which reports really fat profit margins.Yet the real profit improvements are not seen in the fiscal year of 2014 yet, despite the projected earnings increases. The real improvements will be seen in 2015 when fleet modernization, cost controls and lay-offs will really start to make an impact on the bottom line. Note that roughly half of the 3,600 workers which were made redundant have left the company at this point in time.FedEx remains a bellwether as it handles over 10 million packages a day across the globe, giving the company unique insight in the strength of the global economy and changing trends. Continued cautious words from the company should be taken seriously as it calls the current situation the ""new normal.""Back in March of this year, I last took a look at FedEx's prospects. I concluded that investors were negatively surprised by the continued Express troubles which sent shares to $100 at the time.The cumulative profit improvement target of the Express division for 2016 should boost annual earnings by some $500 million per annum, thereby boosting earnings per share by some $1.50. The company notes that it is ahead of schedule in achieving these cost reductions in its conference call.With adjusted earnings estimates around $7.00 at the high end of the range for 2014, earnings could improve toward $9.00 per share if cost benefits materialize and the global economy remains on track by 2016. Further investments in the Ground business, which generates high returns on assets, will be a driver of future earnings, so will lower operating earnings in Freight. The fleet renewal driven by Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 767-300 freight planes are reducing operating costs markedly.Shares trade at 17 times projected earnings for the coming year and about 13 times projected earnings in two year's time given that improvements materialize as anticipated. These are relatively attractive multiples, although I'm disappointed with the lack of dividends.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:UPS). While most investors probably are familiar in some form with Deutsche Post DHL's (OTCPK:DPSTF)) competitive services, getting comprehensive information for the company is not so easy based on the simple fact that it trades on the German stock exchange and is not publicly listed in the U.S.Understanding DHL's comparative business segments and operations as they relate to both FedEx and UPS is a crucial piece to the analysis framework when considering investments in either U.S. company. For this reason the article will provide an overall assessment comparing all three companies and the analysis will be structured into the following areas:INDUSTRY OVERVIEWIt is important for investors to consider some high-level factors which directly impact FedEx, UPS, and DHL. Two primary variables that always play a role in the demand for package delivery, freight, and supply chain are the growth of the global economy and secondarily, the price fluctuations of oil.Global Outlook for Growth of Gross Domestic Product, 2013-2025 (May 2013) (Click to enlarge)Europe includes all 27 current members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.**Other advanced includes Canada, Israel, Korea, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand.***Southeast Europe includes Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia & Montenegro, and Turkey.Source: The Conference Board Global Economic Outlook 2013, May 2013 updateGlobal Outlook for Growth of Gross Domestic Product, 1996-2013 (May 2013)*Europe includes all 27 current members of the European Union, as well as Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.**Other advanced includes Canada, Israel, Korea, Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and New Zealand.***Southeast Europe includes Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Serbia & Montenegro, and Turkey..****The percentage of contributions to global growth are computed as log differences and therefore do not exactly add up to the percentage growth rate for the world economy.Source: The Conference Board Global Economic Outlook, May 2013 update.The above information, courtesy of The Conference Board, displays historical trends of global GDP growth as well as forecasts for short-term and mid-term time horizons. Most interesting to note is that post 2005 trends, advanced economies have witnessed a decline in GDP growth trends of over 50%, while emerging and developing economies have remained stable. For the mid-term horizon year, world total GDP growth is expected to continue its overall downward trend.The diagram below depicts major global trade flows between regions. Based on world GDP growth of 3%, this diagram provides a snapshot of 2012 trade volumes. A key observation is the significance of the Asia Pacific region (China most notably) as the largest regional importer in the world with more than 300 million tons of trade flows coming from each North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

To date prices for oil have declined from the February 2013 peak near the year's low.

A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Newark, Oakland, Fort Worth and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Guangzhou and Cologne/Bonn serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America.Through FedEx Trade Networks the company also provides international trade services, specializing in customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding. FedEx Supply Chain Systems provides a range of supply chain solutions utilizing FedEx information technology and transportation networks around the world.FedEx Ground is a leading provider of business and residential ground package delivery services.

FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with 30,770 owner-operated vehicles and approximately 35,000 company-owned trailers.As FedEx Ground relies on independent contractors for its owner-operator operations, investors should take note regarding the fact that the company is involved in numerous lawsuits and other proceedings (state tax audits or administrative challenges) where the classification of its independent contractors is at issue. Item 1A of the Annual Report Form 10-K above and Note 17 provide more information.FedEx SmartPost (a subsidiary of FedEx Ground) is a leading national small-parcel consolidator, which specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages, using the USPS for final delivery to residences. The company picks up shipments from customers (including e-tailers and catalog companies), provides sorting and linehaul services and then delivers the packages to a USPS facility for final delivery by a postal carrier.FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of less than truckload, or LTL, freight services including FedEx Freight Priority and Economy. FedEx Freight serves every U.S. ZIP code, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

For an overview of DHL's business or information please refer to their most recent annual report.DHL is the only provider of universal postal services in Germany. In the Mail segment, DHL delivers domestic and international mail and parcels and specialize in dialogue marketing, nationwide press distribution services and all the electronic services associated with mail delivery.The Express segment offers courier and express services to business customers and consumers in more than 220 countries and territories. Today, DHL generates almost 20% of its revenue in the Asia Pacific region. Just as FedEx has pioneered express distribution in the U.S., DHL's CEO Ken Allen has claimed that ""DHL pioneered Express services in Asia"".The Global Forwarding, Freight segment handles the carriage of goods by rail, road, air, and sea. DHL is the world's number one air freight operator, number two ocean freight operator, and one of the leading overland freight forwarders in Europe.The Supply Chain segment is the global market leader in contract logistics, providing warehousing, managed transportation, and value-added services at every link in the supply chain for customers in a variety of industries. DHL also offers solutions for corporate information and communications management tailored precisely to the needs of customers.REVENUES AND COMPETITIONBefore diving into the analysis a few technical disclosures need mentioning to aid readers.All year-to-date, or YTD, growth rates are based upon the most recent quarter's data. The growth rate is compounded quarterly, CQGR, and annualized to reflect a current snapshot of the most recent 2-year growth trend. The baseline year of comparison is as follows:This method is utilized in all subsequent sections comparing YTD growth rates, unless otherwise noted. Additionally, a year-over-year percentage change is included to accommodate for seasonality trends, unless otherwise noted.All DHL revenue line items are based in Euro currency. As of the writing of this article, the Euro/Dollar conversion rate was €1.00 equals $1.3067. Please use the following link for any currency conversion interests or needs.FedEx, UPS, and DHL provide mostly similar revenue line items in somewhat varying forms. The three charts below provide each company's revenues by business segment. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)At first glance, revenue growth has not been very exciting for these companies, considering their business segment revenues. However, these charts begin to illustrate characteristics regarding where these companies excel, for instance, FedEx generates a significant amount of revenue from its Express segment, UPS generates a significant amount of revenue from its U.S. Domestic Package segment, and DHL has a diversified range of revenue between €3-4 billion for all four segments.Comprehensively, all three companies generate a substantial amount of revenue. The table below provides comparative growth rate trends based on total revenues. Trailing twelve-month revenues reflect each company's most recent financial disclosure in 2013.When considering total revenues, FedEx provides the most growth with the exception being the most recent year-over-year performance. It is important to note that while DHL clearly generates more revenue than all three companies, roughly one quarter of this total comes from the Mail segment which functions more like the U.S.'s USPS, within Germany. While both FedEx and UPS do provide services that are entrenched with the USPS, it is of interest to exclude the DHL Mail line item for comparative purposes. When considering DHL's revenue growth rates without the Mail segment, it becomes clear that based on the company's strong presence in Europe and Asia, there may be more competitive factors affecting FedEx and UPS growth.The table below provides information regarding express-based package revenues. For FedEx this includes FedEx Express; domestic and international package line items, for UPS this includes U.S. Domestic Package; Next Day Air and Deferred line items and International Package; Domestic, Export, and Cargo line items, and for DHL this includes the Express line item.It is not clear as to the proportion of DHL U.S. revenue, and based on the growth rates by FedEx and UPS combined with 2012 Latin America trade flows to Asia; it would not be a far fetch to assume that a majority of DHL's growth may be occurring from Latin America. What is clear is that DHL is significantly outperforming its U.S. counterparts in the international geographies. FedEx appears to be a strong second ahead of UPS. This table suggests that UPS has been feeling pressure over the past couple years for its non-U.S. operations, and the pursuit to acquire TNT Express was a strategy to leap frog the competition. Improvements to the Cologne facility are in direct competition with DHL and TNT Express.For ground-based revenues the table below provides pertinent information. For FedEx this includes FedEx Ground, and for UPS this includes the U.S. Domestic Package Ground line item. DHL's closest product that resembles this area is its Mail Parcel Germany line item. This line item seems to function as a hybrid USPS-like mail delivery and ground-based parcel service.For those not entirely familiar with UPS, this is the company's bread and butter segment. With a history dating back to 1907, the company has developed into the U.S.'s dominant ground parcel delivery service. To FedEx's credit, this segment represents its second fastest growth driver. In just over a third of UPS's company history, FedEx has grown to nearly 50% of UPS's ground revenues. DHL is experiencing robust parcel delivery growth within Germany.For freight forwarding and supply chain revenues the table below provides pertinent information. For FedEx this includes the FedEx Express Other line item, for UPS this includes the Supply Chain and Freight; Forwarding and Logistics line item, and for DHL this includes Global Forwarding, Freight and Supply Chain; Global Forwarding and Supply Chain line items.FedEx has experienced extremely significant growth in the company's FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx Supply Chain Systems areas; grouped collectively in the FedEx Express ""Other"" revenue line item. Apparently, UPS has struggled recently. Similar to UPS's Ground segment, forwarding and supply chain operations are DHL's strong point. The company has plenty of examples of supply chain ventures in China. As DHL is such a dominant force in this area it is beneficial to expand upon the company's developments.As mentioned, DHL already generates almost 20% of its global revenue in the Asia Pacific region. By 2017, the company plans to increase revenue in the region to a third of its total. In the last several years DHL has invested more than 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to develop products and services in Asia. In addition, the company plans to invest in further aircraft in order to serve the high-demand trade lanes between Shanghai, northern Asia, Europe, and the U.S.Source: DHL Annual Report 2012For freight-related revenues the table below provides pertinent information. For FedEx this includes the FedEx Freight line item, for UPS this includes the Supply Chain and Freight; Freight line item, and for DHL this includes the Global Forwarding, Freight; Freight line item.Both FedEx and DHL have a lead on UPS with respect to freight revenues. This market segment is highly fragmented and there are many other competitors in North America representing LTL and full truckload services including companies like Con-Way Inc. (NYSE:CNW) and YRC Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:YRCW), among others.Revenues and Competition SummaryBased on the revenue analysis it is clear that FedEx Express, UPS Ground, and DHL's Freight Forwarding and Supply Chain line items are the most significant areas for each respective business. When comparing FedEx to UPS, the only area where UPS is slightly outpacing FedEx is in freight-related revenues. FedEx is outperforming UPS significantly in all other major revenue areas, and will continue to chip away at UPS's total revenue lead. DHL seems to be competing much better against FedEx from a growth perspective, granted in some respects DHL is at the lowest end of the group. DHL's core success for the foreseeable future will rely upon its forwarding and supply chain operations; the company is also seeing strength in its Express segment and within Germany.KEY GROWTH DRIVERSKey growth drivers for express and ground-based revenues will include average daily package volumes, or ADVs, and revenue/package yields. Key growth drivers for freight revenues will include freight LTL shipments, weight/LTL shipment, and LTL yield (revenue/hundredweight). It should also be noted that in this section, all YTD data is not annualized and therefore, there is no need for YOY comparisons.For express-based package ADV and yield, the table below provides trailing twelve-month, or TTM, information. For FedEx this includes FedEx Express; domestic and international package ADV and revenue/package yield, for UPS this includes U.S. Domestic Package; Next Day Air and Deferred package ADV and revenue/package yield, and International Package; Domestic, Export, and Cargo package ADV and revenue/package yield, and for DHL this includes the Express package ADV.What is clear between FedEx and UPS is that U.S. revenue/package yields are fairly close and FedEx's slightly higher volume and yield is the reason why the company has generated more U.S. express-based package revenue. It should be noted that FedEx disaggregates its freight-related express operations into freight revenue/pound yield, while UPS does not. It would also appear that UPS has taken some U.S. package ADV market share of late.Non-U.S. express revenue/package yields tell a completely different story. FedEx is able to generate a 52% higher comprehensive yield than UPS (this is declining significantly of late), which allows for them to generate 40% less volume and come within 17% of UPS's Non-U.S. express-based package revenues.FedEx is also growing extremely fast with respect to Non-U.S. package volumes, driven predominantly by international domestic services at 8.5%. This is a direct result from acquisitions in 2012 including the Mexican domestic express package delivery company Servicios Nacionales Mupa, S.A. de C.V. (Multipack); the Polish domestic express package delivery company Opek Sp. z o.o.; the French express transportation company TATAEX; and the Brazilian transportation and logistics company Rapidao Cometa Logistica e Transportres S.A.FedEx managed growth near 1.0% for its international export services. These two services provide the company's lowest and highest revenue/package yields respectively.While total global package volume growth for Express services was strong for DHL, this information is not broken down geographically and revenue/package yield was not available.For ground-based package ADV and yield, the table below provides pertinent information. For FedEx this includes the FedEx Ground package ADV and revenue/package yield line items, for UPS this includes the U.S. Domestic Package; Ground package ADV and revenue/package yield line items, and for DHL this includes the Mail; Parcel Germany package ADV.When comparing UPS to FedEx package ADV, UPS produces almost double the package volume. FedEx returns the doubling effect outpacing UPS based on the growth rate, however, when we consider where this growth is coming from, it is clear that FedEx SmartPost is leading the way growing at a CQGR near 5.5% and while the FedEx Ground segment is growing near 1.8%.This becomes clearer when considering yield information. Although it appears that FedEx is able to command a 10% premium for its revenue/package yield, 33% of FedEx's package ADV is generated from FedEx SmartPost which produces a revenue/package yield of $1.77. If we were to average both of these segments, FedEx would have a yield of $6.60.So while FedEx is making significant progress with ground volumes, their revenues may not necessarily reflect this growth based on the lower yields generated from SmartPost.DHL similarly to the express-based segment displays significant volume growth in Germany, with no information related to yields.For freight LTL shipments, weight/LTL shipment, and LTL yield (revenue/hundredweight), the table below provides pertinent information. For FedEx this includes the FedEx Freight line item, for UPS this includes Supply Chain and Freight; Freight line item, and for DHL there was not sufficient comparative information to be included.Both FedEx and UPS compare closely when considering freight drivers. The primary variable distinguishing between the two is the fact that FedEx provides more average daily LTL shipments, which strongly correlates to freight revenues.Key Growth Drivers SummaryUnfortunately, this section does not provide a complete comprehensive analysis for DHL. The available trends do however speak to the fact that DHL is growing well within Germany, and other international geographies.The highlight from this information when comparing FedEx and UPS seems to be that FedEx's growth drivers continue to exceed that of UPS. When assessing the value of FedEx's growth, we can see that some of their lower revenue/package yield services including international domestic (via acquisitions) and FedEx SmartPost are leading this trend. This speaks to the competitive strength of UPS's domestic Ground services and domestic express-based package services, as FedEx is taking alternative strategies to grow its package and parcel volumes.On the acquisition front, FedEx has recently acquired a South African company, Supaswift and its subsidiaries. This deal should have similar implications, namely reducing international yields and increasing international volumes, and marginally increasing international express revenues.It would also appear that FedEx is better positioned with respect to freight services for express-related packages and LTL freight shipments. FedEx's focus of taking volume market share from UPS within these focus areas may end up paying off in the long-term, but remains to be seen.For other categories without growth drivers including Freight Forwarding and Supply Chain, investors should assume the above high-level developments for world GDP and oil prices. FedEx's supply chain services are the fastest growing segment within the company, while UPS is losing market share, and DHL's dominant presence is only getting stronger.FUNDAMENTAL PEER REVIEWTo be honest this is my favorite part of the analysis. With the above information in the back of our minds, we now will be able to consider stock price growth over time, debt/equity, free cash flow/share growth, earnings/share growth, among many other metrics. Rather than divulge them all in written form, let's get right to it with the table below and accompanying charts. All data is as of the market close, June 25, 2013, and is based on TTM and diluted shares outstanding where appropriate.This table presents us with what I like to call a conundrum. FedEx is the fastest growing company between the three, yet has the lowest enterprise value by a wide margin compared to UPS, and more slightly versus DHL. Based on FedEx's broad strength leading in five of the eight other categories, it does not necessarily make sense for the company to trade at such a depressed EV/sales ratio.The charts below will compare key trends related to earnings per share growth, stock price growth, free cash flow per share growth, and dividend growth, to paint a picture of these core growth drivers. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)When comparing diluted earnings per share growth, the effects of the two recessions are clearly prevalent in 2001/2002 and 2009 performance. FedEx provides the most consistent growth hovering around the 7% level the previous four years. UPS's recent earnings decline is somewhat deceiving as it was a result of one-time pension costs. We can see that the 2013 Q1 result has already improved the YTD marginally for UPS. DHL has struggled throughout the previous ten-plus years to produce positive earnings. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)For investors who have owned FedEx stock over the past decade, returns have definitely been kind. Post-recession returns have fluctuated between 8-9% per year. UPS's stock price has grown at a slow pace during the decade, and DHL, while negative throughout the entire decade has provided some great buying opportunities near their lows. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Personally, free cash flow per share carries the most weight for most of my investment considerations as this metric solidifies a company's operating strength to fund capital expenditures, dividends, and debt obligations, among other financial items. Both FedEx and UPS have generated significant free cash flow per share growth during the previous decade at an annual rate of 14% and 28% respectively. DHL has struggled with negative free cash flow the past five years.The strength of this metric is reflected in capital expenditures as FedEx has averaged over $3.2 billion the past five years, UPS has averaged $2 billion, and DHL has average €1.5 billion. Despite UPS and DHL's close capital budgets, UPS has also averaged an additional $1.8 billion per year in stock repurchases. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)All three companies have averaged a 10% dividend growth rate per year. DHL's dividend has typically yielded a slightly higher amount than UPS, while FedEx, despite solid dividend growth, would take far too long to get to any level close to UPS or DHL, unless they significantly raised their dividend payout.Fundamental Peer Review SummaryFor me the bottom line for FedEx is that the company continues to display leading revenue growth characteristics, while having a significantly depressed enterprise value. The company is financially sound based on its leverage and cash flow generation. FedEx's investments in more fuel-efficient airplanes including greater carrying capacity should improve operating margins and ultimately lead to increased cash flows.The closer FedEx gets to UPS based on revenue and cash flow generation, the stronger the argument for a more consistent valuation, which bodes well for FedEx shareholders.CONCLUSIONAll three of these companies possess significant strengths. FedEx has grown rapidly over the past 40 years pivoting off of its express services. UPS is a dominant force in the U.S. via its Ground segment, while DHL rules the global freight forwarding and supply chain arena.FedEx iterated guidance of earnings per share growth between 7-13% based upon modest GDP growth of 2% in the U.S. during 2013 and 2.5% during 2014. With all of the capital investments and asset disposals, the company is targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion by 2016 at its Express segment.The company also expects earnings and revenue growth for its Express segment this upcoming year and revenue growth for all Ground services based on e-commerce trends, market share gains, and yield growth. Freight is expected to grow modestly.Headwinds include continued pressure on international yields and freight volumes. Please refer to the earnings transcript for more details.On a more speculative note there may be opportunities for FedEx to continue to partner with and/or consolidate aspects of the USPS, which is in a risky financial position. The following link provides the agency's most recent 10-K filing. The agency's current liability challenges involve $11.2 billion in retiree health benefits and $9.5 billion in current debt. This does not even include the agency's regular compensation and benefits or payables and accrued expenses which total $3.7 billion. The company only has $3.4 billion in current assets. Between 2011 and 2012, the USPS net deficit has grown from ($18.9) billion to ($34.8) billion. Many of the USPS volume trends are continuing to decline including First-Class Mail, Standard Mail, Periodicals, and Other services.While it does not make sense for FedEx, UPS, or DHL to attempt to acquire the USPS business collectively, it would make sense for the USPS' services to eventually become privatized. This may occur on a more segmented basis. DHL's counterpart Deutsche Post is a proven record that a national mail operation can fit within a well-established global package, freight, and supply chain company.Overall, DHL's logistics operation is the most intriguing part of the company's future, yet as it is a German-based company most U.S. investors will probably not necessarily be interested in purchasing shares. UPS provides a strong incentive for investors via its dividend payout and growth, as well as its leadership in free cash flow growth. FedEx, however, seems to be a stronger candidate as the leader amongst these three peers based upon the company's key growth drivers, revenue growth trends, and comprehensive fundamental strength.Disclosure: I am long FDX.

1511452,22600,2013-06-19T19:08:20-04:00,,Global economic bellwether FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported earnings today and provided us with a pretty good overview of the state of things. Here are some key pieces of the report:The big takeaways:
1521482,25218,2013-06-26T04:49:51-04:00,,"The purpose of this series is to highlight stocks that are undervalued, profitable, underperformed the market, and have a favorable technical outlook. The stock that I will be covering for my undervalued series this week is FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX). FedEx stock has dropped 3% in the last month but has outperformed the market as a whole, with the S&P 500 dropping just over 4% in the last month. FedEx reported earnings of $2.13/share ex-items before the open on June 19th, which beat the estimate of $1.96/share, and the stock closed higher on the day.ValueTo value FedEx, I will be using the DCF calculator from smartmoney.com, with data for earnings and growth coming from Zacks.com, benchmark data from longrundata.com, and CPI data from the BLS. The DCF table below shows shares of FedEx are undervalued by 34.76%, which represents a potentially quality price appreciation opportunity for shares of FedEx.EPS [ttm]: $6.20Long-term Growth Rate: 12.07%Earnings grow for next: 5 yearsLevel off: to 1% afterBenchmark return: 10 yr annualized SPY return of 7.23%+1.4% inflation= 8.63% benchmarkTechnical OutlookThe chart below shows that shares of FedEx have tested closing below their 200 day moving average [Blue Line] the last two days of trading, but both days they have closed above it. Looking back since October, FedEx share price has closed below the 200 DMA before, but it has rebounded higher after each break. In addition, FedEx has a strong rising support level [Redline] that is below the 200 DMA and has been a strong level, which FedEx has tested 3 times since October and held each time. This could be an opportunity for a long-term entry point in FedEx with shares near two levels of strong support.CatalystThe biggest catalyst for FedEx is the completion of its restructuring plan that it has to make its business more efficient. First, according to an AP summary of the earnings report of FedEx ""3,600 employees will take voluntary buyouts and nearly half of them have already left."" With buyouts only halfway completed, there is still more savings in operating expenses to come for FedEx.The second part of the restructuring is to retire old planes and replace them with new planes. The president and CEO of FedEx Express in a company news release said, ""We are modernizing our aircraft fleet by retiring older, less-efficient, and less-reliable aircraft and replacing them with modern aircraft to build a fleet with higher reliability and better cost efficiency."" With e-commerce continuing to grow, I think this is a smart decision for FedEx, because with rising e-commerce sales comes the demand for shipping those products to end users. Therefore, if FedEx can ship the same goods but do so more efficiently at less cost, that makes strong business sense. I believe the restructuring is off to a good start because the last earnings report showed operating margins had increased from 9% a year ago to 9.6% in the most recent quarter.RisksThe biggest risk to FedEx is the global economy slowing down, and FedEx in its last earnings report hinted that the next fiscal year starting June 1st 2013 might be the case. In the same AP earnings summary as above was the following information: ""The Company forecast that adjusted earnings will grow between 7 percent and 13 percent. That would suggest a range of $6.67 to $7.04 per share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $7.28 per share in the new year."" Therefore, FedEx is seeing the potential that the global economy will weaken, and earnings might fall short of expectations.Closing thoughtI believe shares of FedEx are poised to rebound higher from current levels because the stock is undervalued, the stock is near two levels of strong support, and the continued progress of restructuring. I believe all those factors along with the continued growth in e-commerce, makes FedEx a strong stock to hold for the long term.DisclaimerDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1507632,24706,2013-06-18T08:18:24-04:00,,"By: Brendan Gilmartin, VP Research & ContentOverviewFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to report 4Q 2013 earnings before the bell on Wednesday, June 19. The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Results from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. Furthermore, the guidance for the balance of the full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx shares have been meandering in a fairly narrow range over the past several weeks, despite the broader market volatility. Should results fail to meet the Street's tempered expectations, look for initial support near the 50-Day SMA at $96.00, with further downside risk to $94.00. Conversely, there is initial resistance at the $100-level, followed by 4102 in the event that earnings surprise to the upside. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx shares have meandered in a narrow range, despite evidence of an improving economic backdrop in North American and signs global markets are strengthening. At 13.4x forward earnings, FedEx is also trading at a discount to rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 15.2x, while recent price hikes are seen bolstering margins heading into 2014. FedEx is also seen benefiting from restructuring efforts announced last October, upgrades to its fleet, and a recent multi-billion agreement with the United States Postal Service. As usual, much of the focus will center on the outlook for the 4Q period and balance of fiscal 2013.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1497402,32001,2013-06-12T13:31:22-04:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX), the iconic global shipping and air freight giant whose brand is now part of the American lexicon (i.e. ""FedEx it"") reports their fiscal Q4 '13 financial results before the bell on Wednesday morning June 19th, 2013.Consensus analyst expectations (per Thomson Reuters) are for FDX to print $1.97 in earnings per share (EPS) on $11.46 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of -1% in terms of operating EPS on 4% growth in revenues.Estimates have been revised slightly lower since the February quarter was reported in March '13.The stock is up about 7.5% year-to-date, (as this is being written) lagging the SP 500, which has returned about 2(x) what FDX has for the calendar year. Also, FDX's all-time high was $120 last seen in May '06, so even though the SP 500 has traded to all-time highs this year, FDX continues to trade well below its all-time high.In the February '13 quarter, (i.e. last quarter), FDX reported 4% revenue growth and a decline in EPS of 21% as the Freight segment reported a miss, and the Express cost realignment continues to drag on.The challenges:Here is a brief list of some of the negatives around FDX's operating businesses right now:1.) China GDP has slowed, which has reduced volumes out of Southeast Asia. Can the economic rebound in Japan help regional FDX volumes? Haven't heard that yet.2.) Customers continue to transition from air to sea shipping mediums, which has resulted in excess capacity in international freight;3.) There was an unfavorable volume - mix combination in the Express business, which resulted in the operating margin falling 66% in Express from 5.33% a year ago to 1.76% in the February quarter.4.) From a longer-term perspective, FDX has always had a 10% operating margin as its ultimate goal. As of last quarter, the operating margin was 5.4%, and (per our internal spreadsheet) the only time FDX has met the 10% operating margin goal was May, 2006 and May, 2007. The problem since then has been the collapse and then slow growth in global growth, which is just now in the earliest stages of changing.The valuation:We believe FDX is trading at pretty nice discount to what we think is peak valuation around 1(x) 4-quarter trailing sales, which not coincidentally, the last time FDX traded at 1(x) sales was May '06 and May '07, coincident with the 10% operating margin.Today, FDX is trading at 0.71(x) 4-quarter trailing sales, so a trade back to 1(x) would put the stock closer to $125 - $130 per share.For fiscal '14 and '15, current analyst consensus is expecting EPS of $7.40 and $9.13 for expected y/y growth of 22% and 23% which is well above 2013's 10% decline. My guess is these estimates will continue to get trimmed given FDX's normally-conservative guidance, but even if investors get just half the growth rate expected currently, with FDX trading at 13(x) the 2014 estimate, the stock looks cheap on a PE basis and PEG (PE to growth) basis.Finally FDX's enterprise value (EV) cash-flow valuation of 6(x) continues to be very reasonable, although we would expect EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is likely to grow mid-single digits over the long term. FDX has been scraping along at 5 - 7(x) EV to cash-flow the last 6 quarters.Our internal model values FDX closer to $130 per share, while Morningstar puts an intrinsic value at $112 per share.The chart:(Click to enlarge)Technically, FDX is neither a screaming buy or oversold. Basically it is caught in the middle of its trading range.Summary:FDX can generate healthy earnings growth and maximum margins when there is volume growth across the FDX network. With the much-slower-than-expected return to global growth from the 2008 recession, the freight giant's stock has underperformed the benchmark the last few years, and is lagging again in 2013. However, we think the stock is undervalued by 25% - 30% from peak valuation, although peak earnings could be closer to $10 if we ever see a synchronized global recovery.There is one other element to FDX's story: jet fuel prices, which are closely tied to crude oil prices. With ""fuel expense"" between 10% - 12% of FDX's revenues since late 2010, stable to lower crude oil prices as volume grows is a close to perfect expense environment for FDX.FDX will likely continue to remove costs from the network as they await a global economic recovery. This will ultimately benefit the freight giant when growth returns as FDX will have greater operating leverage in the model.FDX is a high-fixed cost business in an unfriendly economic environment. The stock will really kick in when the economic headwinds become tailwinds.Disclosure: I am long FDX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1487142,24491,2013-06-07T07:44:05-04:00,,"Intrinsic value represents the conclusion to any and all stock research: What is the company worth? DCF valuation captures the expectations of a firm's competitive advantages, growth prospects, strategic endeavors, and any other qualitative factor. No other process does this. Putting to numbers a plethora of advanced fundamental items in arriving at a fair value estimate is the cornerstone--and the most critical component--of any stock research analysis. Without an in-depth intrinsic-value assessment, research is but a story that has no ending. -- Brian Nelson, President, Valuentum Securities, 2011We don't think it could be said any better. Let's dig into FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) intrinsic value assessment.Our Report on FedExInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 12.2% during the past three years.• The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $59, we'd take a closer look. To understand why we use a large margin of safety, please click here.• FedEx's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 6.3% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 54% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 42% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx's shares are worth between $59.00 - $98.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $78 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 4.6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.7%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $78 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $59 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $98 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $78 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $104 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $78 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With over 54,000 delivery vehicles, 660 aircraft, and over 58,000 drop-off boxes, FedEx is the second-largest global package delivery service in the world. FedEx operates four primary business segments which are FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Office.FedEx Express accounts for 62% of FedEx's total revenues and this business segment's revenues are an almost even mix of Domestic (United States) and International business (52% and 48% respectively). FedEx Express is the world leader in guaranteed time of delivery freight, package, and document delivery services. Guaranteed time services include overnight, same-day, and deferred delivery of freight, packages and documents. One important aspect of FedEx Express' international business is its operations in China. With 30 weekly flights into China and a delivery network covering over 400 Chinese cities, FedEx has greater access to the Chinese market than any other United States-based air-delivery service.FedEx Ground comprises about 21% of FedEx's total revenues and is North America's second-largest ground-based package delivery service. Holding second position makes FedEx Ground the United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) major competitor in the North American market. This segment is undergoing an overhaul/expansion, which will expand its operational capabilities and enhance its operational efficiencies to move a larger volume of packages and do it in record time. These increased capabilities/efficiencies will allow FedEx Ground to move an additional 5 million packages per day.FedEx Freight is responsible for about 12% of FedEx's total revenues. Services provided through this segment are less-than-truckload freight and regional freight services throughout the United States. FedEx Office accounts for about 5% of FedEx's total revenues and was once known as FedEx Kinko's. FedEx Office provides services such as copying, packaging, mailboxes and shipping services. This segment competes with UPS Stores and office supply stores such as Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP).Recently, FedEx initiated a profit improvement program. Most of the benefit of this program is expected to occur in 2015 and should give FedEx an additional $1.7 billion in operating profits per year by 2016. Some important aspects of the profit improvement program are investments in technology to better schedule routes for aircraft and ground delivery vehicles and better computer modeling of its extremely complex network of delivery assets to better determine pricing for delivery services. As part of the program, FedEx will retire less efficient aircraft and redesign air routes to maximize the efficiency of its fleet of aircraft.We believe that FedEx, through its FedEx Ground business, will increase its penetration into home delivery services continuing the trend of increasing its market share in the United States. In our opinion, as the global economy improves, FedEx will be a major beneficiary as larger package volumes delivered through its highly efficient operation will generate increased marginal profit margins. Also, a recent 5.9% general rate increase should help drive profits in the near term. We expect FedEx to have a bright future and apparently analysts agree as they estimate that FedEx will earn $6.08/share in 2013 and $7.55/share in 2014.We believe that FedEx is a good buy for the following reasons:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in FDX over the next 72 hours.

1460471,42371,2013-05-24T15:10:48-04:00,,"One of the greatest and most well known rivalries in America is United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) versus FedEx (NYSE:FDX). These two corporations are competing fiercely for customers in the transportation services industry.Performance and OperationsThe last reported annual revenue of UPS was an impressive $54.42 billion. FedEx, on the other hand, ""only"" notched $43.86 billion. At first glance, one is likely to think that UPS is the more dominant of the two companies. But with further examination, something quite phenomenal can be seen. Despite the fact that UPS made $10 billion dollars more in revenue than FedEx, the latter company still manages to bring in a greater profit. The net income reported by FedEx was $1.80 billion compared with $874 million for UPS. This, without a doubt, shows that FedEx is providing greater value to shareholders. Hence FedEx's earnings per share of 5.71 compared with the humbling 0.90 for UPS.In the past 10 years, UPS has seen net income jumping around somewhat unpredictably. It has fallen and risen numerous times, and currently seems to be spiraling downward. FedEx, on the other hand, took only one tumble around 2008-2009, and has otherwise experienced consistent and impressive growth, which seems to be a pattern that is currently active for the company. The chart below clearly illustrates the patterns I have pointed out.FDX Net Income Annual data by YChartsEffectiveness of ManagementBased on the information that has already been discussed, it should be clear that FedEx does a much better job of managing revenues and assets than its primary competitor. But there is even more statistical data that supports this idea. FedEx, led by Frederick W. Smith, has a return on assets of 6.40% compared with the 2.18% of UPS, led by Scott Davis. FedEx has a debt-to-equity ratio of 13.92. This might not seem too great, but it's fantastic in comparison with that of UPS, a disappointing 314.57.Despite the generally greater success of FedEx compared with UPS, the last quarter's reports would lead to different conclusions. In the transportation industry, profitability and efficiency are major measures of success. In the last quarter for FedEx, when compared with the corresponding quarter of 2012, the revenue per package fell about 4%. For UPS, the revenue per piece increased by .4%. Despite this, FedEx still experienced impressive growth in the quarter. Ground segment revenues were up 11% (3 months ended), freight revenues were up 3% (9 months ended), and express segment revenues were up 2%. The segment revenue changes were as follows for UPS:This growth shows that things weren't all bad for FedEx in the last quarter, as its revenue growth outpaced that of UPS.Price ValuationFedEx is currently trading at only 17.35 times earnings, while UPS is trading at 97.01 times earnings. The price-to-book ratio of UPS is an unattractive 20.70 while FedEx is looking cheap with a 1.96 ratio. FedEx also beats UPS in respect to price/sales: 0.72 versus 1.53. Surely, FedEx is at a much more enticing price than UPS.Despite what some of the statistics from each company's most recent 10-Q have led investors to believe, FedEx is operating in a much more successful manner than UPS. Also, the current price of the company's stock offers a much better margin of safety than that of UPS. By the majority of the aspects that have been discussed, FedEx has clearly prevailed as the more attractive investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1423031,44821,2013-05-10T03:31:00-04:00,,"FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) stock has been a significant underperformer since the start of the year largely on concerns that more customers are shipping packages using inexpensive/low profit ground services from the company, rather than opting for high price/high profit air shipping. The concern among many investors was that this would not be a temporary phenomenon that reversed as the economy gets stronger, but rather that this was a permanent secular shift towards expense control by FedEx's clients.Results from two small companies in the last month throw cold water on this thesis though. In particular, results from Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) and Atlas Air Worldwide (NASDAQ:AAWW) suggest the gloom may be over stated for FDX. (See my article on AAWW and why it is severely undervalued here.)Let's start by looking at EXPD and their recent results. EXPD is a freight forwarder, customs broker, and logistics company. Mainly they help manufacturers and distributors move products from one country to another. While the company does business both via ocean and air, for the purpose of evaluating FedEx, air freight is the primary area of interest. Earlier this year, the markets expressed concern over EXPDs performance in the air freight business in particular, sending shares sharply lower. But when EXPD reported at the start of May, things looked much brighter. EXPD CEO Peter Rose said at the time ""It was great to see some sustained traction in year-over-year air freight tonnage growth."" Mr. Rose then went on to say that he and the rest of the EXPD leadership team feel much better about the global economy now, then they did 3 months ago, or one year ago. This is significant for FDX in that if EXPD is seeing increased shipments and volume for air freight, then chances are that FDX will as well.EXPD gave weight to their views both with their earnings performance and with their 7% dividend increase the next day. Indeed, following 6 quarters of consecutive falls in Asian air freight volumes for EXPD, the last two quarters have seen flat or increased Asia air volumes. While it's certainly possible that FDX will underperform, investors can infer from EXPDs results that the global air shipping industry may be getting better, or at least not getting any worse.Atlas Air provides air transportation services in a variety of capacities including moving air freight from place to place. While the firm is small, they do business all over the world, which makes them a good proxy for global air traffic. When planes get used less, lease/charter rates for planes fall and AAWW feels this effect on their bottom line. Concerns over diminished air traffic around the world and the effects of the sequester hit AAWW's stock earlier this year. But when the company reported earnings earlier this month, a lot of those concerns proved unfounded.AAWW beat analyst's estimates handily and raised their EPS guidance for the year. What's more, the company reported that demand for their aircraft is strong, and that they expect a pickup in volumes in the second half of the year. This anticipation of increased activity in 2H 2013 is consistent with commentary from numerous CEOs, particularly those at large industrial companies. Further, new product cycles from (NASDAQ:AAPL), (NYSE:NOK), and Samsung later this year and early next year should provide an even bigger boost to air volumes as the year winds on.All in all, if AAWW and EXPD are to be believed, the air transport business may not be in as bad a shape as everyone assumes. Historically, AAWW and EXPD have been good predictors of FDX earnings with a earnings beat/miss correlation of about 0.72 over the last 3 years (see my blog here for more details).Either way, investors will undoubtedly want to keep an eye on FDX earnings next month, and they should consider using any weakness in share prices between now and then as a buying opportunity.Disclosure: I am long AAWW, EXPD, AAPL, FDX.

1310471,25036,2013-03-31T09:45:41-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is in the midst of rebalancing its U.S. to Asia product offering, as its FedEx Express segment experienced weakness in Q3. This was outlined in the company's Q3 2013 earnings call held on March 20, 2013. Frederick W. Smith, Founder, Executive Chairman, CEO and President, noted the weakness in FedEx Express is due to industry overcapacity and customers selecting less expensive and slower transit for international transport.As a result of the issues in its express segment, FedEx is decreasing capacity to and from Asia and is managing traffic flows to place lower yielding traffic in lower-cost alternatives. David J. Bronczek, CEO and President of FedEx Express, further added the international marketplace has shifted and basically agreed with a conference caller that the company has the wrong assets in the wrong place for the type of business. Additionally, the company is planning on accelerating retirement of some of its older, less efficient aircraft. Alan B. Graf, CFO and Executive Vice President, further added the capacity reduction will lead to savings related to fuel, crew and maintenance costs. As a result of the changes, the company's international air fleet will remain unchanged for 2 or 3 years. It was further clarified in the question and answer session of the conference call that the changes the company is making with regards to international transport are not designed to move traffic from the air to ocean.On the Q3 conference call, T. Michael Glenn, Executive Vice President of Market Development and Corporate Communications, presented a forecast for modest U.S. GDP growth of 2% in 2013 and 2.5% in 2014. Mr. Glenn offered a forecast for global GDP growth of 2.3% in 2013 and 3% in 2014. Mr. Glenn also noted the forecast for 2013 is uncertain primarily due to policy issues in the U.S., Europe and China. Additionally, Mr. Glenn noted housing and auto segments of the economy are showing improvement and the e-commerce market segments is performing very well with mid-teen growth rates.While the FedEx Express segment is struggling, Mr. Smith indicated its FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight performed solidly in Q3. Mr. Graf, indicated FedEx Freight has been leveraging the benefits of its integrated network to reduce costs by 5% year-over-year. Cost reductions were realized through higher utilization of rail and other efficiency improvements. David F. Rebholz, CEO and President of FedEx Ground Package System, noted the company's performance is primarily a result of making FedEx's service proposition greater than offered by its competitors.While the Q3 conference call focused primarily on the Asia overcapacity situation, Mr. Smith noted the Latin America market segment is performing well and Mr. Bronczeck indicated the performance is aided by two of its acquisitions, one in Mexico and one in Brazil. Mr. Bronczeck indicated he expects to see terrific returns in the Latin America market when profitability has been harvested. China was also mentioned as performing and growing well with the company currently serving over 400 cities in China. Additionally, Mr. Rebholz noted the company experienced a really good holiday season with a lot of demand related to online e-commerce.Following the conference call, FedEx stock price took a hit as shown below:With FedEx's recent stock price correction, its future prospects in Latin America/China, and its very low valuation as garnered by its Price-to-Sales ratio of 0.8, the company is worthy of consideration for an investment. However, with the uncertainty for 2013, as noted by FedEx's Mr. Glenn, a protected investment is considered. A married put stock option position is considered, as it provides for unlimited upside with limited downside. The married put position experiences a profit with an increase in stock price, but doesn't suffer a large loss if the stock price decreases significantly. A married put position can be entered by purchasing a put option against a long position in the stock. The month of expiration for the put option is selected several months in the future in order to reduce the per-day cost of the put option insurance.Using PowerOptions, a number of married put positions for expiration in October of 2013 were found for FedEx as shown below:The married put position using the 2013 Oct 100 put option looks attractive as it has a maximum potential loss of 5.1%. However, after consideration is made for expected dividend payments during the holding time, the maximum potential loss if reduced to 4.8%. The details for entering the FedEx married put position are shown below:FedEx Married Put Position:A profit/loss graph for one contract of the FedEx married put position is shown below:For an increasing stock price, the value of the married put also increases and for a stock price below the $100 strike price of the put option, the value of the married put position remains unchanged. And, if the stock price increases to above the $100 strike price of the put option, then income methods may be applied in order to receive income and reduce risk as taught by RadioActiveTrading.com.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Below I have highlighted this quarter's earnings estimates as well as provided a fundamental look at the company's financial position and valuation.Profile and EstimatesFedEx has a market cap of $31.62 billion and had annual sales last year of $42.6 billion. Shares currently trade for $99.78 and are up 8.93% YTD, 19.25% over the past 52 weeks and down 9% from their March high of $109.66 per share. Analysts have a mean price target of $114.74 and a median price target of $117.00 on the shares. Last quarter, the company's EPS of $1.23 was $0.15 below the street's expectations, the company's second earnings miss in a row.This quarter analysts on average are expecting EPS of $1.97 on revenues of $11.45 billion. As you can see below, FedEx has slightly outperformed shares of UPS but both fall below the 23.97% 52-week gain of the S&P 500.^SPX data by YChartsAnalysis (data sourced from MorningStar.com)As you can see from the operating efficiency above, and the graph below, revenues have steadily risen over the past few years but net income has recently started to fall due to rising costs. Return on assets has also slowly fallen as the asset base of the company has grown at a faster pace than revenues and some of the higher return on equity is attributable to the higher leverage taken on by the company. FedEx's liabilities have grown 29% over the past five quarters to $15.7 billion.FDX Net Income Quarterly data by YChartsDividends and SharesFDX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOver the past five years the number of shares outstanding has increased with no significant change/dilution since the end of 2011. During that same time, the company's dividend has increased to its current $0.60 per share, good for a yield of 0.56%.Bottom LineManaging costs will continue to be the company's goals as its large moat leaves most competitors in the dust. The company has been focusing lately on modernizing its aircraft fleet by retiring less-efficient and older planes, which is a good move considering its new express air contract with the United States Postal Service, worth $10.5 billion. Keep an eye out for new developments and updates on Wednesday.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1506262,23479,2013-06-17T15:20:09-04:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a holding company with subsidiaries that provide a broad range of transportation, e-commerce, and business services under the FedEx brand. It is scheduled to announce its Q4 and full-year earnings on June 19. Shares of the courier delivery services company have traded in a narrow range over the last three months after they tanked 7% after its third-quarter results. Investors realize there has been a fundamental shift in the dynamics of this industry, but the company is adjusting its operations in order to adapt to the changing environment.Clients have now adjusted their lead times and prefer to get their items delivered through shipping mediums, which has resulted in an excess capacity in international freight. A continuing shift in freight traffic from air to sea driven by higher fuel prices is not helping the air cargo industry at all. The shift in customer demand for slower deliveries is apparent from the fact that FedEx's international deferred package volumes grew 12% in the previous quarter, while international priority volumes could only manage a 2% rise. The company expects the trend to continue going forward and plans to improve its cost structure, to align lower yielding operations with lower cost networks by leveraging its FedEx trade network capabilities.Although the company derives half of its revenues from its Express division, it only contributes about 15% to the stock price as per our estimates. FedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for the U.S. domestic and international delivery of small packages and freight. U.S. Express provides guaranteed delivery of deferred packages in two to three days and overnight delivery of urgent items within the U.S. through its Overnight Box and Overnight Envelope offerings. International Express guarantees time-definite delivery service to more than 220 countries and territories, with unparalleled air route authorities and an extensive air/ground infrastructure.Thin margins due to high fuel prices combined with a grim volume forecast are the reasons why we think the division's profitability to the total company will be limited. The segment's operating income plummeted by two-thirds to $118 million in the third quarter, primarily due to a shift in demand toward lower yield offerings.FedEx Ground Holds the KeyOn the other hand, the performance of the FedEx Ground will be critical. FedEx Ground offers small-package ground delivery services and low-cost, day-certain service in the U.S. and Canada. It also includes the Smartpost service that uses a hybrid delivery mechanism leveraging the delivery networks of U.S. Postal Service or Canada Post Corporation for final delivery. Although the division's contribution to the top line in the previous fiscal was less than 25%, it was the source of more than 50% of the company's consolidated operating income.FedEx Ground's revenues jumped 11% in the previous quarter due to higher volumes (up 10%) from both home delivery and commercial categories. Smartpost posted smart gains in volumes, which rose 26% year over year due to rising e-commerce deliveries. With growing expectations of free shipping of goods purchased through the fast-growing electronic market, e-retailers are increasingly adopting the low-cost ""hybrid"" alternatives like Smartpost offered by FedEx to cut down on shipment costs.Disclosure: No positions."
1303321,23479,2013-03-27T07:25:03-04:00,,"After a disappointing set of Q3 results from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) last week driven by overcapacity in the international freight industry and an unfavorable volume-mix in the express package delivery segment, we have adjusted our price estimate for the company. Key drivers impacted by the change in our outlook for the company are average daily international priority and economy shipment volumes, and FedEx Express EBITDA margins.According to our analysis the company now relies on its ground operations for more than 80% of its $107 valuation. Here, we take a look at the key factors driving the change in our outlook for the company.See Our Complete Analysis of FedExOvercapacity  In International Freight Industry Driving Lower PoundsSluggish global GDP growth driven by policy uncertainties in the U.S., China recording the slowest growth rate in a decade and Europe’s struggle with an economic nightmare is driving feeble consumer demand globally. High debt levels in the U.S. due to low lending rates over the past years is further holding back spending as consumers prioritize debt reduction over consumption. All of these factors are responsible for the slower growth in world trade seen in 2012, and are expected to continue to have their bearing on international trade during 2013 as well.Slower than expected trade growth has negatively impacted the global freight industry as yields have plummeted due to tough competition. Moreover, continuing shift in freight traffic from air to the sea, driven by higher fuel prices is not helping the air-cargo industry at all. FedEx Express reported a sharp 13% decline in international priority freight revenues, while international air freight revenues fell by 17% year-on-year during the third quarter. For the first nine months of the fiscal year ending May 2013, these figures were down 7% and 6% respectively.Overall, the air freight pounds are expected to grow at a modest 2-3% annual rate as the integration of world economies over time will increasingly drive movement of small shipments directly from the point of production to the consumer. However, heavier, less urgent and low value per pound shipments will increasingly shift towards the sea route as companies thrive to manage their total distribution costs efficiently, which would limit the growth in air freight segment.FedEx Express registered growth in average daily package volume in both, priority (up 2% y-o-y) and economy (up 12% y-o-y) categories. However, revenue growth from the express package delivery segment was subdued due to lower composite yield (down 4% y-o-y). This can be attributed to accelerated shift in customer preference toward economic offerings. According to the management, load factors were very high on international express routes. However, they were serving the lower-yielding products mostly. This reduced the top line directly while the use of high-cost priority network for deferred package deliveries put severe pressure on margins. The management looks towards reducing the impact of this continuing trend by redirecting lower-yielding deferred packages through its low-cost deferred and FedEx Trade networks. (See FedEx’s Weak Results Spark Fears Of A Long And Feeble Recovery)Due to the unexpected extension of this particular trend, our estimate of the CY2012 EBITDA margin for the express segment declined by around 2.5%. However, we forecast the segment’s EBITDA margins improve to around 17.5% by 2016 (down around 150 basis points from our earlier estimate) primarily due to the company’s extensive ongoing profitability improvement program that aims at improving the company’s profits by around $1.7 billion by FY2016, compared to the base of FY2013.Disclosure: No positions"
1290301,25120,2013-03-20T15:55:20-04:00,,"Shares of FedEx (FDX) traded with losses of up to 7% in Wednesday's trading session. The global transportation and e-commerce firm reported a disappointing set of third quarter results accompanied by a lowered full year outlook.Third Quarter ResultsFedEx generated third quarter revenues of $11.0 billion, up 4% compared to last year. Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates of $10.85 billionDespite the modest uptick in revenues, operating income came under severe pressure. Operating income fell 28% to $589 million, as operating margins fell 230 basis points to 5.4%. The main reason for lower profits is the accelerating shift of demand towards lower-yielding international services.Net income fell 31% to $361 million on the back of disappointing operating margin developments and a $47 million business realignment charge. Normalized earnings fell from $1.55 per share towards $1.23 per share over the past quarter, while GAAP net earnings per share came in at merely $1.13 per share. Both adjusted earnings, as well as GAAP earnings, fell way short of consensus estimates of $1.39 per share.The company will take additional measures and will reduce its Express capacity to and from Asia. The company might even retire older, less fuel efficient aircraft quicker than anticipated.To provide any comfort to shareholders amidst the poor results, FedEx' Board of Directors has authorized a 10 million share repurchase program, sufficient to retire a little over 3% of its shares outstanding.A Detailed Look Into The EarningsThe main problem for FedEx is its express segment. Despite the fact that revenues increased by 2% to $6.70 billion, operating income fell by two-thirds to merely $118 million. Profitability fell hard on lower fuel surcharges and customers move towards lower-yielding services.The ground segment had a decent quarter as revenues rose 11% to $2.75 billion. Yet operating income was largely unchanged at $467 million, as operating margins fell by 180 basis points to a still very healthy 17.0%. Revenue and volume growth was largely made undone by higher purchased transportations and buyout charges.The freight segment continued to be stagnant. Revenues came in essentially unchanged at $1.24 billion, while the business managed to squeeze out an operating income of $4 million.Clearly the express division, which generates the majority of firmwide revenues is putting stress on the overall results as operating income fell dramatically. The revenue performance at the ground business has been very solid, but competition and one-time items have eaten into the fat margins of the business.OutlookFedEx expects to report adjusted earnings between $1.90 and $2.10 per diluted share for the final quarter of the year. This will result in full year adjusted earnings per share of $6.00-$6.20, down from an earlier guidance of $6.20-$6.60 per share.Last year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.99 per share. GAAP earnings per share are expected to come in between $0.94 and $1.34 per share in the final quarter, as the company expects to take large charges related to its voluntary buyout program in an attempt to save on costs.In the third quarter, FedEx took $47 million in charges related to the voluntary buyout program. The company expects to take charges of $450-$550 million for the full fiscal year of 2013, resulting in charges of $0.89-$1.09 per share. As such, net earnings are expected to come in around $4.90 to $5.30 per share.ValuationThe company ended its third quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $2.2 billion in short and long term debt for a net cash position of roughly $1.2 billion.For the first nine months of the fiscal 2013, FedEx generated revenues of $32.9 billion. The company net earned $1.26 billion, or $3.97 per diluted share. At this rate, FedEx is on track to generate annual revenues of $44 billion, on which it could earn roughly $1.6 billion, or around $5.10 per diluted share.Factoring in a 7% correction on Wednesday, the market values FedEx around $31.2 billion. This values operating assets around $30 billion, or 0.7 times annual revenues and 18-19 times annual earnings.FedEx pays a quarterly dividend of merely $0.14 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.6%.Some Historical PerspectiveOver the past decade, shares of FedEx have roughly doubled. Shares rose from $50 in 2003 to highs around $120 in 2007. Shares lost two thirds of their value during the 2009 recession, as they hit $40 that year. Shares steadily recovered and are currently exchanging hands at $100 per share, despite Wednesday's correction.Between 2009 and 2013, FedEx grew its annual revenues by almost a quarter from $35.5 billion to an estimated $44 billion. The company steadily increased its profitability towards an expected $1.6 billion in 2013, down from 2012's peak.Investment ThesisIt has been October of last year when I last took a look at the prospects for FedEx. At the time investors reacted very favorable to the company's $1.7 billion profitability improvement program for the period between 2013 and 2016.Shares traded around $90 per share at the time and advanced to highs of almost $110 earlier in March this year. After Wednesday's results shares have given up roughly half those gains. The profitability improvement program calls for annual earnings to increase by roughly $500 million per year. Note that the $1.7 billion target was a cumulative target for 2016, and not an annual target.Adjusted earnings for its fiscal year of 2013 are expected to come in around $2 billion. As such, adjusted earnings could come in around $2.5 billion or $7.50-$8.00 per share in three years time. This estimate excludes any organic growth in revenues and profitability, as well as one-time charges.While FedEx shows healthy growth, I am not convinced about the long term potential at these levels. Shares trade at roughly 16-17 times adjusted 2013's earnings and roughly 20 times net earnings. This valuation multiple will drop to roughly 13 times 2016's expected adjusted earnings. I find this little appealing given the operational difficulties and the low dividend yield.I remain on the sidelines. While investors applauded the company's profit improvement program last year, they appear to be shocked in today's environment. Charges, estimated at $450-$550 million will come ahead of the benefits. Adding to that the more severe issues at the ""express"" division, and investors are rushing for the door today.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1295661,23479,2013-03-22T15:01:13-04:00,,"FedEx  (NYSE:FDX) stock fell around 7% Tuesday after the company reported Q3  earnings for the fiscal year ending May 2013. Reported EPS fell 28%  year over year during the quarter despite revenue growth of around 4%. Continuing  weakness in the FedEx Express segment due to shifting customer  preferences for slower and lower yield offerings more than offset growth  in Ground and Freight segments.FedEx International Express Demand Scenario Worse Than ExpectedRevenue from the FedEx Express segment grew 2% primarily due to  business acquisitions while organic growth in top line was limited due  to unfavorable volume mix. The segment's operating income plummeted by  two-thirds year on year to $118 million primarily due to a shift in  demand towards lower yield offerings.Within the Express division, the U.S. domestic operations did  relatively better as both revenue per package and average daily package  volume increased 1% year over year. However, an unfavorable volume mix in the  international Express segment due to slowing global demand and GDP  growth scenario impacted operating margins negatively. Tough comparisons  due to the reversal of a $66 million reserve associated with a legal  matter during the same period last year, higher pension and depreciation  expenses and costs associated with the ongoing profitability  improvement program further reduced earnings for the segment.The shift in customer demand for slower deliveries is apparent from  the fact that FedEx's international deferred package volumes grew 12%,  while international priority volumes rose by just 2% year over year for the  quarter. The fact that this trend has accelerated instead of slowing  down as expected earlier is not a good sign. The company expects the  trend to continue going forward, and plans to take actions like reducing  its Trans-Pacific capacity from April 1 and improving its cost structure  to align lower-yielding operations with lower cost networks by  leveraging its FedEx trade network capabilities.These measures may also involve temporarily or even permanently  grounding some of its aircraft, which could potentially result in higher  asset impairment charges in the future. Although the long-term market  fundamentals are still intact and improvement in global GDP growth is  expected to drive growth in international trade in the coming years, the  persistence of this trend longer than expected will drive our current  forecasts for the segment's EBITDA margins and international priority  shipment volumes lower.Ground and Freight Continue to RiseThe FedEx Ground segment reported 11% year-over-year growth in revenues on  higher volumes (up 10%) from both home delivery and commercial  categories. Revenue per package grew marginally by 1% as higher rates  and residential surcharges were partially offset by lower weight per  package and fuel surcharge. Smartpost posted smart gains in  volumes, which rose 26% year over year due to rising e-commerce deliveries while  the revenue per package was negatively impacted by rate hikes  implemented by USPS.Operating margins for the Ground segment were down to 17% from 18.8%  last year due to a one-time favorable self-insurance adjustment during  the same period last year and charges associated with the business  realignment program during this quarter. Higher network expansion cost  and expenditure on purchased transportation further squeezed margins.The Freight business saw an improvement in yield by 2% due to a  better base yield from the economy offering as revenue grew marginally  to $1.24 billion due to growth in average daily LTL shipment volumes.  Operating margins improved from -0.1% last year to 0.3% during the  quarter, despite higher depreciation and amortization costs and  investment in transportation facilities as the higher use of rail drove  fuel costs 5% lower year on year.Going forward, we expect to see continued top-line growth in the  Ground segment backed by e-commerce growth. An improvement in market  share (FedEx holds more than 30% share currently) driven by higher  network coverage is expected to drive better operating margins as  network expansion costs stable. Moreover, the use of natural gas based  vehicles for transportation that FedEx is currently testing is further  expected to enhance profitability (see ""What's Fueling FedEx's Adoption Of Natural Gas Powered Trucks?""). We  also expect to see the Freight business stabilize on a positive  operating margin track with better volume-mix driven top-line growth.We currently have a $122 price estimate for FedEx, which will be revised downward due to the current weakness in the Express segment.Disclosure: No positions."
1302801,42111,2013-03-27T01:15:35-04:00,,"One of the classic forms of investment that hedge funds and sophisticated investors employ is known as a long/short strategy. This strategy attempts to limit volatility in the position and portfolio. The basic idea, is to be ""long"" (buy) the stronger company, and ""short"" (sell) the weaker company. A key when using this strategy is to make sure the positions are equal in size.Generally, when using stocks, the companies used in this strategy are in the same industry. Ideally, if the market or industry is somewhat directionless, the stronger ""longed"" company increases in value, while the weaker ""shorted"" company declines, and there is a profit on both positions. When the market or industry advances strongly, both stocks may increase as well, but the stronger company should increase more than the short, providing a marginal gain. Likewise, if the market or industry declines, the weaker shorted company should decrease more than the strong ""longed"" company.So this strategy can provide gains in many scenarios and limit risk on the downside. Of course, it is possible that your choice of stocks to use as long and short are based on an incorrect analysis. This is why solid analysis is so important. Also, unexpected events, such as the announcement of a major business deal or other news, can change everything. This makes proper capital exposure to the trade, relative to portfolio value, very important as well.I thought I would use two stocks that I have been monitoring recently to demonstrate this strategy. They are FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS).FedEx vs United Parcel ServiceFedEx Corporation's most recent quarterly results show a slowdown in global shipping (especially to China), reflecting the continued global economic slowdown. Additionally, they noted increased use of lower-priced ground shipping domestically, instead of the higher-priced express air shipping. This is an issue because FedEx's ""bread and butter"" is express shipping.As the many differing views of commentators and analysts since the quarterly results have made apparent, it is: 1) unclear whether the changes are part of a longer-term decision by customers to spend less on shipping (or whether the choice was more transitory); and 2) unclear how long the global slowdown and its effects on shipping companies will last. FedEx lowered its earnings estimates during the conference call as a result.My opinion on these changes is basically that FedEx is still the superior company in this industry, and it will make changes to mitigate customer decisions. The CEO stated:I also believe that the changes in the shipping space will affect UPS in most areas as well. Its a comparison strategy after all, so this should work relatively well. In terms of using FedEx and UPS as the stocks in this long-short strategy, FedEx can still be the ""long"" and UPS the ""short."" This is especially true if using a longer time frame because it gives FedEx time to use its superior financial condition and management to adjust to changes.FedEx is in excellent financial condition. Margins at FedEx are higher than UPS. FedEx has a gross margin of 25% versus UPS' 15%. FedEx has an operating margin of 7.08% versus UPS' 2.45%. FedEx has higher quarterly revenue growth than UPS. FedEx has a long-term debt to equity ratio of .12, while UPS' is 2.38.FedEx also provides better value than UPS. While neither company has a very low PEG, FedEx's is 1.36 versus 1.72 for UPS. That shows that price relative to future growth rates is less for FedEx. Comparing forward P/E ratios, FedEx's is 12.82 while UPS' is 14.87. That shows that FedEx's price relative to the future year's projected earnings is lower than UPS' price. Comparing price to book value, FedEx's is .7, while UPS' is 1.49. FedEx is therefore priced below book value. Comparing enterprise value to revenue we find that FedEx's is .69, while UPS' is 1.59. This indicates that FedEx is valued far cheaper than UPS when you compare their revenue. Any way you slice it, FedEx is not valued highly when compared to UPS. The market may be discounting FedEx for long-term industry changes, but analysts are not.For reasons of value and strength of management, FedEx is the best choice for the long component in the long-short strategy, while UPS should be the short.ChartsYou can see the gap down in the FDX chart below. It seems to be holding the 100-day moving average. If that does not hold, the next level of support is between $94-92, where the 200-day moving average is located ($93), and where there was heavy buying volume.Also, note that the UPS January earnings announcement led to a gap down, but it rallied since that time. FedEx could do the same.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1283791,24706,2013-03-18T14:46:10-04:00,,"By: Brendan Gilmartin, VP Content And ResearchOverviewFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to report 3Q 2013 earnings before the bell on Wednesday, March 20. The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Profits from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. While the company has already telegraphed its outlook for the 2Q period, the guidance for the balance of the full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Outliers And StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx shares recently touched a 52-week high of $109.66 (March 11, 2013) and is up more than 25% since mid-November. In recent weeks, however, the shares have meandered in a narrow range - an indication that the recent advance may be somewhat exhausted. Should results fail to meet the Street's lofty expectations, look for initial support at $106.00, with potential downside risk to $102.00 if results fall shy of forecasts. Conversely, the aforementioned high of $109.66 could offer soft resistance. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx shares recently hit the highest level since 2007 amid evidence of an improving economic backdrop in North America and signs global markets are strengthening. The market is also betting that the restructuring efforts announced last October remains on track and FedEx could ramp up efforts to return money to shareholders over the course of the year. At 13.8x forward earnings, FedEx is also trading at a steep discount to rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 21.2x, while recent price hikes are seen bolstering margins heading into 2013. As usual, much of the focus will center on the outlook for the 3Q period and balance of fiscal 2013.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis and or data in this report.

1287011,23479,2013-03-19T15:45:47-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to announce its third quarter results on March 20, 2013. The company reported $11.1 billion in revenues during the second quarter, up 5% y-o-y. Reported operating income declined 8% y-o-y during the same period dragged down by the FedEx Express segment (down 33%). Superstorm Sandy negatively impacted diluted EPS reported at $1.39 by $0.11.For the third quarter, we expect volume growth in FedEx Ground operations led by record holiday shipments and retail e-commerce growth. FedEx Freight numbers should reflect a positive impact of 2011 restructuring while FedEx Express is expected to report lower revenues primarily driven by unfavorable mix of services.Below are some of the key trends we would be closely watching in this release. [1]See our complete analysis of FedEx hereFedEx Ground Shipment Volume Boosted By Holiday Season Online SalesFedex Ground reported an 11% jump in revenues y-o-y during the second quarter primarily driven by higher volume. The ground segment operations have seen significant growth in the past few years driven by strong growth in online sales. According to a recent investor presentation by FedEx, U.S. online sales have been growing by almost three times as much y-o-y as the retail sales which have tracked the GDP growth rate closely. [2]As the market leader in the segment with almost 30% market share, FedEx is expected to benefit the most from this continuing strong trend. [3] Further growth in the segment is expected form the company’s strong holiday season performance. According to the company’s estimates, 2012 holiday season is expected to boost overall volumes by around 13% y-o-y. [4] December is the peak of the holiday season, and Q3 results are expected to be boosted by this significant volume growth.Restructured FedEx Freight Business Model To Drive Operating Income HigherSince its restructuring in 2011, FedEx’s Freight business has seen a sharp turnaround. Freight revenue increased by around 4% y-o-y during the second quarter while operating income jumped sharply by 90% led by higher yield due to differentiated services and efficient network design. We expect to see the positive impact of this turnaround on consolidated operating income in the third quarter results as well.Soft Economic Conditions and Efficiency Program Costs To Impact FedEx ExpressFedEx Express revenues were up 4% y-o-y in Q2 primarily due to international acquisitions while organic growth was suppressed by weak global economic environment and Superstorm Sandy. Continuing macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe  and a slowdown in growth in the emerging economies like China and India have been driving customers away from the high-yield time-bound offerings toward low-yield, more economic options. This trend is expected put pressure on both top-line and bottom-line figures of this segment in Q3 FY2013.Further, profitability improvement program charges related to staff functions and processes, the growth of International Priority business and a restructuring of delivery routes to improve overall efficiency are expected to negatively impact the bottom-line during during this quarter. [5]Overall, we expect Ground and Freight segments growth to drive Q3 earnings growth primarily while earnings growth from the FedEx Express division is expected to be flat-to-negative. Consolidated operating income is also expected to be boosted by the rate changes announced by the company on January 7th, 2013. [6]We currently have a $120 price estimate for FedEx, which will be updated based on Q3 earnings announcements.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1309131,34201,2013-03-29T13:00:13-04:00,,"Most transportation companies are like a proxy for worldwide economic demand, as they transport everything under the sun from raw materials to important documents. One among them is the bellwether FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which reported rather weak 3Q12 results. Its results took investors by surprise and increased woes regarding the global economic recovery. Despite that, I think FedEx is a good buy right now. In order to clarify my stand, let us take a peek at its 3Q results first.3Q12 resultsAlthough its revenues increased 4% to $11 billion (versus analyst expectations of $10.86 billion), operating income dipped 28% to $589 million. As a result operating margin declined 230bps to 5.4%, the biggest fall in third quarter profit. Integration expenses related to recent acquisitions in Brazil, France, Mexico and Poland also impacted margins. It reported net income of $361 million and EPS of $1.23 compared to the analyst consensus estimate of $1.38.Reflecting continued pressure from declining international revenues, it guided for 4Q12 EPS of $1.90 to $2.10 and FY13 EPS of $6 to $6.2, which was again below analyst expectations of $2.13 and $6.35, respectively for 4Q12 and FY13.Delving a little further, the company mentioned that it experienced a tough third quarter as it faced declining profitability in FedEx Express. Decline in FedEx Express was mainly due to the shift towards lower yielding international services and lower international yields. As it faces increased pressure from a large proportion of consumer direct shipments, it mentioned that it would reduce its capacity in Asia and move its traffic towards lower-priced services. As part of its restructuring activities, it will also retire its older and less efficient aircrafts.Details on its Segment Revenues:FedEx Ground revenues increased 11% to $2.75 billion and its yields increased 1.9%. Although it posted strong operating margins of 17%, it was lower than 18.8% in the previous year. Further, average daily volume grew 10% driven by growth in FedEx Home Delivery and 26% growth in FedEx SmartPost (due to increase in e-commerce). Its operating margins were lower due to higher purchase transportation and higher network expansion costs.FedEx Freight revenues were flat while operating margins improved to 0.3%, vs. a loss of 0.1%. Though marginal, but still this was the first profitable quarter for the segment. It continued to leverage the benefits of an integrated network, improved Less-than-truckload (LTL) yield of 2% and improving operational efficiencies.Turning to the problem area - FedEx Express. Its revenues increased marginally by 2% to $6.7 billion but its operating income declined by more than half to $118 million. Express Domestic package yields increased 2.1% due to rate and discount improvements, followed by increased weight per package. Though volumes increased by 4%, it is facing an accelerating shift towards lower-yielding international services, i.e. customers are preferring lower priced truck or ship services rather than the faster, higher priced air services. In order to mitigate this decline, the company has lined up additional cost-cutting actions for the line haul network, which represents a large portion of its costs for international services. When asked at the earnings call, if the shift was due to trade down experienced by shippers or more of a competitive issue (UPS (NYSE:UPS) has announced a new product and DHL is getting more expressive), management mentioned that the problem was - ""the wrong product on the wrong network."" It mentioned that volume was not the issue but overcapacity was the issue.Initiatives and RestructuringThe company is doing all that it can to maintain its profitability. Its ongoing profit improvement initiatives include aircraft modernization, pickup and delivery productivity, aircraft maintenance processes, and further facilities rationalization.In an attempt to reduce its costs, in February 2012, the company announced voluntary buyout for its employees. Including the 3Q12 costs, the company now expects the FY13 pretax cost of the voluntary buyout program to range from approximately $450 to $550 million in cash expenditures and some additional costs in FY14.It reiterated its $1.7 billion profitability program from FY13-FY16 and mentioned that 75% of the benefit would accrue in FY15.Strong Competition:FedEx faces competition from United Parcel Services (UPS) and DHL (Privately held). United Parcel swung to a net loss of $1.75 billion due to a pension-related charge of $3 billion, despite its revenues increasing 3%. Its average revenue per package had declined in 3Q12 as it experienced a problem similar to FedEx. However, in 4Q12, the average revenue per package increased 1.4%. Further, its international export volume increased 5.5%, driven mainly by growth in Asia. DHL on the other hand, continued to post strong growth across its segments and posted a revenue increase of 5.7% in 4Q12. Further, it also announced an increase in its 4Q12 results and expects its positive earnings trend to continue in line with its expectation of earnings increase of 13% to 15% between 2010 and 2015.ConclusionLooking at FedEx's results, the question arises whether its customers are migrating to lower margin products due to economic cycle or is it due to a shift in its corporate clients. But the company is doing its bit by investing in long-term projects to drive long-term profit growth.Despite its weak 3Q12 results and outlook, I would still give it a ""Buy"" on the basis of its restructuring initiatives, affordable P/E of 15.9, better margins and growth vs. its competitor United Parcel Service.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1263191,23479,2013-03-11T12:14:53-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a holding company with subsidiaries that provide a broad range of transportation, e-commerce and business services under the FedEx brand. Its primary operating companies are Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”), the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”), a leading provider of small package ground delivery services; and the FedEx Freight LTL Group, which comprises the FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL businesses of FedEx Freight Corporation.The company reported annual revenue of $42.7 billion in FY2012 with operating income of over $3 billion. We have a $122 price estimate for the company, which is around 15% above the current market price. Here we discuss the outlook for some of its key divisions and drivers critical to our valuation.See our complete analysis for FedExFedEx Express OverviewFedEx Express offers a wide range of shipping services for the U.S. domestic and international delivery of small packages and freight. U.S. Express provides guaranteed delivery of deferred packages in two to three days and overnight delivery of urgent items within the U.S. through its Overnight Box and Overnight Envelop offerings. International Express guarantees time-definite delivery service to more than 220 countries and territories with unparalleled air route authorities and an extensive air/ground infrastructure. The division operates more than 45,000 motorized vehicles and a massive fleet of over 650 aircrafts knitting together more than 375 airports worldwide. It contributed more than 62% in revenues during FY2012. Here are two factors that are driving FedEx Express.Brighter U.S. Economy Outlook and Penetration in AsiaCompared to the last four years, we expect a relatively healthy U.S. economy with around a 2% GDP growth rate in 2013. A pick-up in economic activity and consumer spending is expected to drive demand for higher priced Overnight Express services in the U.S. market. While the European economy is still marred with uncertainties, a larger penetration in the Asian markets and reduced shipment time across the Pacific with the inclusion of Boeing 777F are expected to drive volumes for this segment.Voluntary Buyout Program and Fuel EfficiencyOn February 15, 2013, FedEx Express and other FedEx companies offered voluntary cash buyouts to the eligible U.S.-based employees. [1] The program, which is aimed at increasing overall profitability by around $1.7 billion during the next three years, is expected to result in $650 million pretax cash expenditure for FY2013. Higher fuel efficiency targets set by the company after outperforming its earlier target of a 20% improvement in fuel economy by 2020 as compared to 2005 will also push EBITDA margins higher for FedEx Express division. [2]FedEx Ground OverviewFedEx Ground offers small-package ground delivery services and low-cost, day-certain service in the U.S. and Canada. It also includes the Smartpost service that uses a hybrid delivery mechanism leveraging the delivery networks of U.S. Postal Service or Canada Post Corporation for final delivery. While the division’s contribution to FY2012 revenues was less than 25%, it was the source of more than 50% of the company’s consolidated operating income. Below are a few trends driving our valuation for the division that makes up more than two-thirds of our price estimate.Continued Ground Network Expansion Since 2002, FedEx Ground has opened 11 new hubs, featuring the most advanced material handling technology. It has also expanded and/or relocated more than 500 local facilities. The expansion is expected to continue in the future that will increase FedEx Ground’s average daily package volume.Rise of e-Commerce and Smartpost According to research done by comScore and Forrester, the e-commerce market is expected to be worth $250 billion by 2016. With growing expectations of free shipping of goods purchased through the fast-growing electronic market, e-retailers are increasingly adopting the low-cost “hybrid” alternatives like the Smartpost offered by FedEx to cut down on shipment costs. This is expected to drive volumes higher for these offerings. On the other hand, rising fuel prices and expected price hikes by the U.S. Postal Service as it tries to crawl out from its massive debt are expected to drive revenues per package higher as well.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1276431,32001,2013-03-15T09:28:26-04:00,,"Federal Express (NYSE:FDX), the iconic freight company that changed the lexicon of American business (i.e. ""Fedex it"") is set to report their fiscal 3rd quarter, 2013, financial results before the bell on Wednesday March 20th. Analyst consensus is looking for $1.39 in earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) on $10.855 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of -10% and +3% respectively. The stock is up about 18% year-to-date (ytd) as this is being written, far exceeding the SP 500's return. The stock was up about 10% in calendar 2012, and got crushed in 2011.FDX announced last fall the restructuring of FedEX Express, which is its traditional freight business that has been plagued by slowing volumes and poor yields the last few years. Detailed to investor's in October, FDX announced that there will be $350 million in savings in fiscal '14 from the restructuring, with an overall ""profit improvement"" of $1.5 billion for the plan.These aren't minor numbers of you consider that FDX has 315 million in shares outstanding, thus the cost savings in the 2nd half of calendar 2013 could see $1.50 per share in higher EPS, with the $1.5 billion over the next several years, potentially adding $5 to FDX's EPS. Forward estimates were raised for FDX after the October Investor Day, but it is unclear how much of the total restructuring is in analyst numbers.By segment:FedEx Express is 2/3rd's of FDX's total revenues, but just 1/3rd of operating income. In the 2nd quarter, FDX Express saw US domestic volume fall 2%, while total Average Daily Volume (NASDAQ:ADV) rose 9%, and yet ""yield"" fell 5% in a freight market where rates have been firm. (There is still rational competition between FDX and UPS, and it has kept prices firm in a slower economy.)FedEx Ground, the trucks you see on the street every day, has been the real star at FDX. Started in 2000, Ground is 23% of FDX's total revenues but 2/3rd's of operating income. Last quarter, Ground's volumes were +8%, while yields were +2%.FedEx Freight is finally starting to turn around, after being a drag on FDX's results for many quarters. Freight operating income has now grown y/y for three consecutive quarters, the first time that has happened since early 2008.There are four important elements to FDX that a traditional retail investor needs to keep in mind:1.) FDX's operating margin was 6.5% in fiscal q2 '13 (last quarter) and the company has always wanted to get that closer to 10% and keep it there, which it has had a hard time doing. The Express restructuring, which should take expenses out of the division, should help drive operating margin leverage, just as the global economy starts to re-accelerate;2.) FDX's business model has both operating leverage and financial leverage. FDX has a higher fixed cost base than UPS (NYSE:UPS), and in my opinion was always a better transport play when U.S. and global growth was accelerating. We are still early in the recovery - because of FDX's operating leverage, better volumes and better global growth are a bigger positive for FDX than other large-cap freight companies;3.) FDX's operating cash-flow is just 10% of revenues and FDX's capex is roughly 80% of FDX's cash-flow (hence free-cash-flow is minimal) so FDX does not have a lot of room for the dividend and share repurchase than you are seeing from other companies in today's market, and which seems to be driving stock action;4.) Jet fuel and the fuel surcharge matter to FDX. The best environment for FDX is faster global growth and volumes, with stable to falling oil prices. Oil and jet fuel prices matter. When crude oil and thus jet fuel prices fall, and the fuel surcharge stays on, it fattens profit margins for FDX;In fiscal 2013 (end May '13), EPS are expected to fall 4%, but then accelerate to 24% and 19% in 2014 and 2015 for FDX, on what is expected to be mid-single-digit revenue growth. FDX currently is trading at 17(x) fiscal '13's estimate of $6.35 and 14(x) and 11(x) 2014 and 2015's estimates.With the recent rally in the stock, FDX is now trading about 8(x) cash-flow. Technically, the stock put in a series of tops in 2006 and 2007 near $120 per share, with FDX's valuation trading at 1(x) 4-quarter trailing revenues and 10(x) - 11(x) cash-flow at that time.Valuation:Today, FDX is trading at 0.80(x) 4-quarter trailing revenues, and 8(x) cash-flow so if we compare peak valuations, then FDX has more room to run, possibly to $140 if we use peak valuation metrics from 2006 and 2007. Our internal model values FDX near $122 per share, while Morningstar thinks the stock is worth $112. If China and Japan can turn decisively, and Western Europe can stabilize and possible generate just a little growth, synchronized global growth in the U.S. economy will help FDX dramatically.We've been long the stock for some time, suffering through a leveraged freight company in a slow economy. It looks like our patience is starting to pay off. Higher volumes run through a leaner operating business as a result of the restructuring and thus a higher operating margin, could be Nirvana for the freight giant. Operating margin expansion from the current level of 6.5% would help drive p.e expansion in FDX in our opinion.Disclosure: I am long FDX.

1302341,24491,2013-03-26T17:28:38-04:00,,"International shipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported weak third quarter results and a light outlook as its customers have flocked towards lower cost shipping options. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $11 billion, slightly above consensus expectations. Earnings fell 21% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis to $1.13 per share, as operating margins declined 330 basis points to 5.4%.On a segment basis, FedEx Express revenue grew just 2% year-over-year to $6.7 billion, with volumes and pricing up 1%, respectively in the US. International Economy shipping volumes grew 12%, while International Priority volumes increased just 2%. As a result, average export revenue per package fell 3%, leading segment operating margins down 350 basis points to 1.8%. CEO Fred Smith noted that the ""door-to-door"" international market is still performing well, but blamed the air cargo market for the lackluster results, saying:""It is the air cargo market, and the air cargo market is, as I mentioned a moment ago, has been adversely affected by lower economic growth around the world caused by the policy choices that are now reflected in the European situation, relatively low growth in the United States and China situation. So the International Express business is still growing, the door-to-door part of the business. And these aren't new things. They just perhaps have accelerated a little bit because of this overcapacity situation.""We think part of the problem is that companies have adjusted to demand slack by dragging out shipping cycles - if something isn't moving off the sales floor (or website), then there's no incentive to quickly stock inventory. We could see this business accelerate if macroeconomic conditions improve, but we also see a scenario in which leaner organizations simply accept longer shipping cycles to reduce coasts. Such a condition would be bearish for FedEx.FedEx Ground performed significantly better, with revenue surging 11% during the third quarter to $2.8 billion, though operating margins fell 180 basis points to 17%. Average daily volume grew 10%, while average revenue per package increased 1%. Ground shipping could benefit from two obvious tailwinds; the first being increased online selling, and the other being the demise of a subsidized competitor in the US Postal Service. These trends will benefit both FedEx and competitor UPS (NYSE:UPS). Management described the trend well when talking about the holiday season, stating:""So what happened in the holiday? The holiday was a great season for us. All of our large customers had exceptional demand. There was clearly demand from the online world that probably had not been experienced historically. That was good for them, and that was good for us.""Freight, easily FedEx's smallest segment, flat-lined with $1.2 billion and earnings of $4 million versus a loss of $1 million during the year ago period.Going forward, management hopes to realize some cost savings from fleet investments, but it will take some economic growth upside to help the firm post stronger earnings growth. FedEx will be reducing its Trans-Pacific capacity beginning April 1, which could help stabilize pricing.FedEx's outlook for fiscal year 2013 was certainly not good, as the firm took a hatchet to its previous guidance of $6.20-$6.60 per share in earnings, as it now anticipates earnings $6.00-$6.20 for the full-year. This forecast excludes the impact of corporate reorganization costs, and is a far cry from the original guidance of $6.90-$7.40 per share given in June of 2012. At this time, we continue to believe shares of FedEx are fairly valued, and we have no interest in adding them to the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company generates two thirds of its revenue from its express division. With its massive international shipping network and rival DHL's exit of the domestic U.S. parcel delivery market in 2009, FDX enjoys a narrow economic moat with a costly entry barrier. FDX continues to adjust its operations and trade networks to adapt to the post-recession trade trends. For 2013, the company is expected to generate higher revenue and EPS at a valuation which is below the industry average.Q2, 2013 Earnings Beating Estimate and Analyst's CallOn December 19, 2012, FDX reported earnings of $1.39 per diluted share for the second quarter ended November 30, compared to $1.57 per share last year. Superstorm Sandy impacted the quarter's result by $0.11 per diluted share due to reduced shipment volumes and incremental operating costs. By factoring out the Superstorm's impact, FDX's profit was $1.50, beating analysts' estimate of $1.41 according to Thomson Reuters.As stated by Frederick Smith, FedEx Co.'s Chairman, President, and CEO,The company's ground business is taking market share from its larger rival, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). FDX is also planning to trim costs, particularly at the air express unit, due to slumped profit.Looking forward, FDX projected earnings to be $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share and reaffirmed its forecast of $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share for fiscal 2013 before charges related to the company's previously announced voluntary buyout program. Analysts are expecting an EPS of $6.38 for fiscal 2013, which is lowered from $6.57 as estimated 90 days ago. The Q2, 2013 earnings call transcript for FedEx Management Discussion from Seeking Alpha can be read here.On December 20, the analyst at Jsyke Bank maintained a Buy rating on FDX with a 12 month target price set at $115. As stated by Jsyke Bank's analyst,Key Stats Comparison and ValuationWith the data obtained from Morningstar, FDX's key stats will be compared to its peers in the Integrated Shipping & Logistics Industry, including UPS. FDX has a higher revenue growth (3 year average) of 6.3 and EPS growth (3 year average) of 174.5, comparing to the industry averages of 1.9 and 11.5. However, FDX had a lower operating margin of 7.2%, ttm, and net margin of 4.5%, ttm, as compared to the averages of 8.5% and 5.6%, ttm, respectively. FDX also generated a weaker ROE of 12.5, comparing to the average of 24.4. FDX has a healthier debt-to-equity of 0.1, as compared to the industry average of 0.8.FDX currently has a P/E of 14.6, P/B of 2.0 and P/S of 0.7, which are below the industry averages of 19.4, 4.4, and 1.0. The Forward P/E is 11.4, which was below S&P 500's average of 14.2. The PEG ratio is 0.9. FDX is under-valued compared to its peers.Technical AnalysisFDX closed at $92.74 with a 0.57% loss on Friday. The volume of 2.92M is 41.75% more than the 30 day average of 2.06M. FDX had been trading in the range of $82.78-$97.19 in the past 52 weeks. FDX has a beta of 1.24. The MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator had been showing a bullish sign since November 29; however, the MACD difference has now diverged. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is showing a declining bullish lean at 63.73. FDX is currently trading above its 50-day MA of $90.26 and 200-day MA of $89.11. The next resistance is $93.90, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comOptions PlayPositive growth, a solid balance sheet, consistent cash flow and a narrow economic moat give FDX a long-term buy rating. FDX is also bullish in the short-term, technically. A credit put spread options play will be reviewed for bullish investors who would like to acquire the stock at a lower price and gain some upside potentials.The maximum profit is $0.43, and the maximum risk/margin requirement is $2.07 ($2.5 loss - $0.43 credit received). If FDX closes above $82.50 on April 20, 2013, a 20.77% return on margin will be gained. If FDX falls below $82.50 upon options expiration, FDC stock will be acquired at $82.07, which is 11.51% lower than the current price of $92.74.Note: All prices are quoted from the closing of December 21, 2012 and all calculations are before fees and expenses.

1079971,28511,2012-12-24T07:05:31-05:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reported a 12% year-over-year drop in quarterly profits. This is due to hurricane Sandy and the global economic slowdown, which has changed customer's preferences from high margin overnight delivery service to cheaper alternatives. This shift was also evident in FedEx's income by segment. Operating profits at its premier air express unit dropped by 33% to $230 million, while margins have shrunk from 5.2% in 2011 to 3.4%. On the other hand, operating income of its slower ground and freight segment are up by 4% and 90% to $412 million and $76 million, respectively.In short, the fall in air transport was offset by ground operations. This is a trend I expect to continue in the long term as the era of cheap, abundant energy that facilitated the model is over and therefore air freight volume is likely going to drop, but margins may remain as it will weed out all of the price elastic customers, leaving those whose need far outweighs the shipping cost differential.FedEx earned $1.39 per share - $438 million - which is in line with its forecast but lower than analysts' expectations of $1.45 per share and far short of the $1.57 per share - $497 million - in the same quarter last year. Overall quarterly revenues rose by 4.7% over 2011 to $11.1 billion.However, excluding the extraordinary losses resulting from hurricane Sandy, income climbs to $1.50 per share. FedEx also said that as long as ""the U.S. does not go off the fiscal cliff and into a recession,"" the company is going to report flat earnings for this year as compared to last year, in the range of $6.20 to $6.60 per share. In the future, growth is expected to be modest at best due to restructuring measures, which includes buyout incentives for thousands of employees. The buyout is expected to cost up to $600 million severely impacting earnings. The restructuring will also revamp its ground operations and make the express air business more profitable.In its third quarter, FedEx had already reduced its guidance by 10%. Similarly its rival UPS (UPS) also lowered its forecast from $4.75 - $5.00 per share to $4.50 - $4.70 per share citing similar reasons. As I pointed out earlier, the logistics giants, such as FedEx and DHL, have built up their business around the high margin quick delivery air operations which has now come under pressure from:UPS dominates the ground operations but FedEx's rising revenues in this area indicate it is eating into UPS's market share. Ground operations are becoming a more important part of FedEx - as I've said out of necessity -- and now contribute about a quarter of the total sales. This is where I feel any growth will come from, especially when one begins to consider the changes coming to production models, which I feel are also going to become more regionally focused.Meanwhile, holiday shipments are expected to reach a record high due to the explosion in e-commerce. The competition in the U.S market is heating up between UPS and FedEx. While UPS is promoting its year old 'My Choice' service for its 'premium' customers, FedEx is busy reminding people that it is the only firm that delivers on Saturday. Deliveries to residential customers are rising faster than those to corporate customers. And, since the residential business is relatively more labor intensive, the key to success lies in the number of customers per neighborhood. This is the main area where both UPS and FedEx are going to fiercely compete in the coming years with new promotions and offers.Since January, FedEx's stock has been ahead of UPS but both have trailed behind SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) which is up 14.96% in the corresponding period. At this point, however, UPS trading at a multiple of 22 looks fully valued. Especially if the Fed blows a new commodity bubble with the latest round of unsterilized QE which will cause energy prices to rise faster than GDP and offset any gains made. The difference between their ground operations will then come down to how much of their fleet has been converted to natural gas, which will be relatively cheap for the foreseeable future. FedEx just began a test of the Westport (NASDAQ:WPRT) Cummins LNG engine for its long hauler tractors, but they are more than a year behind UPS on this front.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1211571,42201,2013-02-21T13:20:41-05:00,,"After my recent article on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), I decided I would also look at FedEx (NYSE:FDX). For financial information, I will be using FDX's annual reports. The graphs in this article were all made by me. Please note, I have compared FDX to UPS, but their fiscal years end at different points in time (31st of May for FDX and 31st of December for UPS). Dates shown in the graphs below all refer to fiscal years.Let's start by looking at FDX's revenue, as compared with UPSRevenue for FedEx has gone up from $35.5 billion in 2009 to $42.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 20%. In the same period, UPS's revenue went from $45.3 billion to $54.1 billion, increasing 19.5%. There's no clear winner here.Net income: Growing, but nowhere near UPSIn the 2012 FY, FDX's net income was $2.0 billion, less than half of UPS's $4.4 billion. Of course, this is partially due to the fact that UPS has revenues that are a lot higher. Using net income as a percentage of revenue, we can compensate for this difference.It's easy to see UPS beats FDX in this category. Out of every dollar in revenue, UPS has just over 8 cents in net income (2012), where FDX has only 4.8 cents/$.Saving up money for the future: Low but sustainable dividendFedEx's dividend has gone up from $0.44 in 2009 to $0.52 in 2012. While it is nice to see dividends increase, at the current stock price of $105.69, FDX will yield a 0.5% dividend. UPS will bring in 6 times as much dividend, yielding 3.0%.This policy of paying out a small, but increasing dividend has led to FDX being able to save up a lot of money, which it can use to expand its business. FDX's payout ratio is only 8.1% (2012), whereas UPS pays out just over half of its EPS to shareholders (50.3% for 2012)FDX's current assets have grown substantially over the last year, going from $7.1 billion in 2009 to $9.1 billion in 2012, growing by 27.3%. Current liabilities have only grown by 18.9% in the same period, going from $4.5 billion to $5.4 billion.Current Ratio going up, now at 1.69The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay back its debts over the next 12 months. It is divined as current assets divided by current liabilities. FDX's current ratio has gone up from 1.57 in 2009 to 1.69 in 2012. It is now approaching UPS's current ratio of 1.83.So, which should you buy?I believe both FDX and UPS are great stocks, but they're completely different. If you're looking for a stock with a nice sustainable dividend, go for UPS's 3% yield. If you want to own shares in a company that's more focused on growth, go for FDX. Personally, I might just buy them both.Share your thoughts on UPS and FDX, comment below!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in FDX, UPS over the next 72 hours.

1070781,24706,2012-12-18T11:44:52-05:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinFedEx (FDX) is scheduled to report Q2 2013 earnings before the bell on Wednesday, December 19. The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. ET and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Profits from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. While the company has already telegraphed its outlook for the Q2 period, the guidance for the full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Key MeasuresEarnings Per Share (Q2 2013): FedEx announced back in September that earnings for the Q2 are expected to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share. The revised Street estimate is toward the high end of that range at $1.41. (Source: Yahoo Finance.)Earnings Per Share Guidance (Q3 2013): Note that FedEx tends to offer fairly conservative guidance. The current estimate is $1.45 for Q3 2013.Earnings Per Share Guidance (FY 2013). Keep a close eye on earnings guidance for 2013. Back in September, FedEx said it projects earnings to be $6.20 to $6.60 per share for fiscal 2013. The current estimate is $6.39.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx shares are up more than 7% from the mid-November low, pushing the shares back above the 200-day SMA (near $89.00) and 50-day (near $90.00), with latter cross back above the slower -- a sign that momentum is improving. The upward-sloping Relative Strength Index (RSI at 59 is below the 70-overbought level) and MACD are also testament to the recent strength. Near-term, there is resistance in the $93/$94 area in the event of a positive surprise, with support at the aforementioned moving averages ($89.00/$90.00). (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com.)SummaryFedEx shares are trading a mere 5.7% below the 52-week high ($96.58) established last February amid evidence of an improving economic backdrop in North American and signs that the holiday shipping period is tracking better than expectations. The market is also betting that the restructuring efforts announced in October, which call for profitability improvement of $1.7 billion during the next three years, is also on track. At 14.2x trailing earnings, FedEx is also trading at a steep discount to rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 21.2x, while recent price hikes are seen bolstering margins heading into 2013. As usual, much of the focus will center on the outlook for the Q3 period and balance of fiscal 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

FDX is a best-in-class investment and while it's not a huge growth story, it's the best way to play a recovering US economy and the continued rise of e-commerce at the same time.Missing estimates has made the stock cheapOver the last 6 quarters, FDX has grown earnings inconsistently. However, the company has been consistent in one area: beating street expectations. The company beat projections every quarter since 2011 until last quarter, when it missed on restructuring costs.Due to this underperformance, the company trades at a sharp discount to its major competitor, UPS. A large part of the variance is due to restructuring FedEx Express, which was announced last fall.Operational wins will lead to rising earnings and multiplesBut FDX continues to beat UPS operationally. FDX's year-over-year growth is currently running almost double that of UPS. (numbers from Yahoo)The company's gross margin and EBITDA are currently running 70 percent greater than its larger competitor. And the company's operating margin over the last year was better than the market average, despite legacy issues around FedEx Express.The company is taking market share at an opportune time: oil prices are hitting recent lows which makes shipping more profitable. And e-commerce continues to see double digit growth.Low expectations give the company a spring for growthAnalyst consensus is looking for $1.39 in earnings per share, down 10% from last year. The stock is currently trading at a price-to-sales about half of UPS, despite much better operational ratios.There are some risks though - Europe's impact on the macro story could be a problem if it really starts to hinder trade. And restructuring could be more complex than anticipated in a company that handles such complex logistical chains. But with middling expectations to begin with, there's much more upside than downside with FDX.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

By that I mean we need insight into whether this Christmas season will be a good one or or bad one.Judging from the numbers put out this week by FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), it may pay to shop early.That's because UPS, a self-described leader in logistics (meaning getting merchandise on shelves) is cutting its estimates for the fourth quarter. FedEx - which does more of the final delivery - is forecasting a 13% increase in shipments. That would be a stellar year.So far this year, FDX is up almost 10% while UPS is flat, but the latter - which popped $2/share on the open today - is still trading at a higher earnings multiple, 18.3 vs. 14.5. That's probably because UPS' margins are higher than those of FDX, bringing in over $1 billion/quarter to the bottom line against a half-billion for FDX, even though the top line at UPS is only about 20% higher.By contrast, FDX has much less debt as a percentage of assets than UPS, and its operating cash flow looks much stronger. All this tells me that if you believe Christmas will be special this year, FDX is in a better position to capitalize, while if you think the Grinch is going to steal it, go with UPS.I'm with FDX.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1070111,24491,2012-12-18T06:09:02-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $83, about in line to where it is currently trading.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below). More interest equals more buying equals a higher stock price, in our view.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. FedEx posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare FedEx to peers CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW), Expeditors Intl (NASDAQ:EXPD), and United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS). In the spirit of transparency, we show how our strategy has created outperformance in the portfolio of our newsletter below:Our Report on FedExInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• FedEx's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return oninvested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 12.2% during the past three years.• The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being.• FedEx's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'dexpect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 6.3% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 12.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 54% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 42% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx's shares are worth between $62.00 - $104.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $83 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 4.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.1%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $83 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $62 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $104 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $83 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $111 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $83 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Express is 2/3rd's of FDX's total revenue, but just 30% of operating income today, so the segment remains a drag on FDX's financials and operations.The issue through the years (as i see it) is dwindling volumes on Express packages.

(Although this is my math, with the target date of completion scheduled for FY 2016, and this being the 2nd fiscal quarter of 2013, we can conclude that the initiative should generate an additional $1 per share per year in terms of the combination of additional profits and expense savings.)On the brighter side, FDX's Ground and Freight segments are contributing nicely to combined operations as management deals with Express.FDX Ground is 23% - 25% of total revenues but is now generating over 50% - 60% FDX's total operating income, as FDX Ground has steadily gained share from UPS since its launch in 2000. Ground has been a star so to speak, for the transportation giant, and is expected to have another decent holiday season.One note of caution: Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon have started to initiate same-day delivery (SDD), which should be a boon for the ground transport companies, but when I asked WMT who they were using, they responded ""UPS."" As SDD grows, I don't think FDX would want to ignore this potential new opportunity.FDX Freight: just 12% - 13% of revenues, Freight was a drag on operating income until 2 quarters ago, when the division started contributing profitably to operations, and was 12% of operating income last quarter. In the last 16 quarters, per our spreadsheet, Freight has run at an operating loss in 9 of those quarters. Hopefully the turnaround that has started in Freight two quarters ago will stick. Our Freight data starts in late '08, but the last two quarters of operating income of $81 and $90 ml, has been the best two quarter's of profitably that we have modeled for the company.Since late 2008, and over those 16 quarters, Freight has lost a cumulative $95 million in operating income.FDX peaked at $120 per share in 2006, and hasn't been back to that level since. (See chart)Trading at 6(x) cash-flow and 5(x) enterprise value (EV) to cash-flow we think FDX is one of the great bargains in the market within the industrial sector. However, the stock trades cheaply because of FDX's operating leverage, which is defined as the percentage change in operating income for a given change in revenues. FDX has an asset-intensive and high fixed-cost operation, and the stock really gets a kick when the economy is running at a high rate of GDP and output, which we are most certainly not at right now.What would catalyze the stock (in our opinion)?1.) Certainly a prolonged drop in jet fuel prices would help. A December 11th, 2012 report out of Deutschebank noted that jet fuel prices have fallen 13% since September 14th. Since 2003, fuel has ranged from 6% to 16% of FDX's revenues (internal spreadsheet) and last quarter was 11% or right in the middle of the 10 year range. The fuel surcharge helps mitigate this pressure, but given the recent sharp drop noted by Deutschebank, FDX actually benefits when the fuel surcharge is in place, and the price drops, since margins fatten as a result.2.) An acceleration on GDP which result in an acceleration in volumes. Certainly Express would benefit, since that model works best when volumes are on the upswing. There is no mystery to higher leveraged businesses benefiting when running higher volumes over a fixed cost base.3.) New initiatives like Amazon's and Wal-Mart's same-day delivery which opens new markets for the ground-based giants;4.) Continued rational or measured competition: UPS and FDX have not had an all-out price war, which might be expected given the oligopolistic nature of the sector right now. DHL has supposedly exited the US market, although occasionally I still see their trucks. ""Yields"" or profit per package has been very much a bright point the last 10 years. FDX recently announced a series of rate increases for 2013, which I thought were in the 6% range.If I had to pick one ""preferred"" choice among the above 4 factors, I think a prolonged acceleration in the US and global economy would benefit FDX quite nicely, even if crude oil prices spikes, since the fuel drag could be partially offset by the fuel surcharge. A sharp acceleration in GDP combined with a fall in crude would be a double-barreled catalyst for the iconic brand.We are long the stock and would only add more closer to $80. We think FDX like much of the industrial sector will benefit from an improving China and Southeast Asia, but would benefit most from an improving US economy.Disclosure: I am long FDX, WMT, AMZN.

935131,24276,2012-10-19T09:28:25-04:00,,"As the holiday shopping season ramps up we're seeing a merger between the worlds of online and offline shopping.The big winner, to my mind, should be FedEx (NYSE:FDX), which is feeding the strategies of both sides.Online brands like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are planning ""pop-up stores"" in major malls. Meanwhile JC Penney (JCP) is talking about ditching the traditional check-out counter in favor of terminals in clerks' hands linked via WiFi and RFID tags on the merchandise.Macy's (NYSE:M) is launching a host of new brands aimed at Web-raised young shoppers, which tell stories rather than just offer merchandise, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is doing Lightning Deals on popular toys that remind me of the old Kmart ""blue light specials"" from back in the day.So just as stores try to replicate the easy comfort of the online world, replacing big stores with smaller showroom spaces as Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has, online stores are trying to replicate the instant gratification of the offline world, linking with UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx for same day deliveries.This was an inevitable end-point of trends that have been building for almost 20 years now, ever since the Web was spun and I was asked to be an ""e-commerce"" reporter for NetGuide. Both online and offline shopping have their advantages, they can be complementary, and investors would be wise this year to bet on merchants who can get the balance right.Who will be the big winner? I wouldn't be surprised if it's FedEx. With a PE under 15, and lots of delivery contracts from both offline and online merchants like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), it seems well-positioned to be a happy Santa this holiday season, no matter how people choose to shop.Disclosure: I am long MSFT.

899591,31291,2012-10-02T10:09:48-04:00,,"To borrow a phrase from the company's famous advertising slogan, it's ""absolutely, positively"" no surprise that FedEx Corp. (FDX), operator of the world's largest cargo airline, is encountering temporary headwinds because of the weak economy. However, this delivery giant is en route to future growth.Memphis-based FedEx encompasses four segments managed collaboratively under the aegis of its universally recognizable brand:FedEx Express, the world's largest overnight delivery company, offers time-certain delivery within one to three business days; FedEx Ground provides low-cost, small-package ground delivery service to every business address in the U.S. and Canada, as well as delivery to nearly 100 percent of U.S. residences; FedEx Freight handles less-than-truckload freight services; and FedEx Services provides other companies with sales, marketing and technology support.FedEx in September projected its first earnings drop since 2010 as weak global economic growth, the continuing debt crisis in the euro zone and a slowing China depressed demand for the express packages that generate most of the company's revenue.For the first fiscal quarter of 2013 that ended August 31, FedEx will likely produce $1.37 to $1.43 in earnings per share, the company announced in September.That estimate is less than the company's June 1 EPS forecast of $1.45 to $1.60 and EPS of $1.46 during the same period a year ago. It would mark the first drop in EPS for FedEx since its second quarter that ended November 2010.The stock has fallen nearly 3 percent since news of the company's diminished expectations. However, the investment consensus is overly negative and ignores secular trends that should lift the stock of this speedy parcel-delivery specialist in the coming months.A leading component of the Dow Jones Transportation Average, FedEx is viewed as a barometer of the wider economy. For the same reasons that investors studied railroad stocks in the 19th and 20th centuries to understand economic trends, investors today increasingly focus on companies such as FedEx to divine the bigger picture.The second-largest package delivery company in the world, behind United Parcel Service (UPS), FedEx will be an important brand name to watch as monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe move to stimulate economic growth during the latter part of this year. More sanguine analysts already see FedEx's fiscal second-quarter revenue moving 4 percent higher to $10.9 billion and EPS increasing by 7 percent to $1.56.At the same time, slowing revenue has added impetus to FedEx's cost-cutting campaign, which includes a voluntary employee buyout program and the grounding of aging, fuel-guzzling cargo planes.Rising fuel prices played a major role behind FedEx's earnings miss, but the company is mothballing roughly 20 older jet freighters this fiscal year, replacing them with newer Boeing 767-300 and 757-200 aircraft that burn less fuel and are cheaper to operate and maintain.The company estimates that these combined efforts will eliminate up to $900 million in costs. The company is now earning 6 percent more per package so far this year, despite a 5 percent decline in total shipments, a sign that greater efficiencies are already taking hold.Every day, FedEx Express' global air-shipping network delivers an average of 3.4 million packages from more than 6,400 authorized shipping centers, totaling about 26.5 million pounds. Last fiscal year, the segment accounted for 62 percent of the company's $42.7 billion in total revenue. In leaner and more efficient shape than any of its rivals, it's poised to receive a huge boost when the global economy finally gets back on track.Meanwhile, the company's chief rivals are struggling with long-term challenges from which FedEx is immune. UPS, aka ""Big Brown,"" is saddled with an aggressive union that severely restricts the company's ability to rein in costs and streamline its workforce, whereas FedEx is a non-union shop and is likely to stay that way.Uncle Sam's WoesThe U.S. Postal Service, grappling with its own union problems and enormous health care obligations, is looking at eliminating Saturday delivery. In August, the USPS reported a $5.2 billion quarterly loss, prompting the Postmaster General to warn that delivery may be cut back to three days a week within 15 years.FedEx is not only unencumbered with these limitations, but it's also well positioned to capitalize on an economic rebound. Growth sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals demand frequent speedy shipments with high assurance of delivery, which is the bread-and-butter service of FedEx. The company is an integral part of the increasingly extended global supply chain, equally trusted by huge corporations and mom-and-pop outfits.FedEx also is opening scores of new stations in promising markets, such as China, Brazil and Eastern Europe, as part of an organic expansion plan. China presents the most exciting opportunities.Chinese authorities recently granted both FedEx and UPS the freedom to operate in China without the burden of forming regional partnerships with local Chinese companies.FedEx's management estimates that the delivery market in China will grow by a whopping 400 percent from now until 2020, when it generates annual revenue of $26 billion. FedEx was given the ability to ship independently in eight Chinese cities, including the major industrial hubs of Shanghai and Guangzhou.The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.6 is attractive compared to the P/E of its arch rival UPS, which has been bid up to 18.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

918561,23822,2012-10-11T11:34:20-04:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is a name investors talk about in good times and bad because it's a name that performs in direct relationship to the economy. The company held an investor day this week, after which it captured our radar screen. While we try to focus on ""quality"" names, today we will talk about the fundamentals of FedEx, and compare the valuation of its stock to its closest competitor United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Ultimately, we will answer the question ""Is FedEx an investment opportunity?""So lets start with valuation: FedEx is up 2.5% today behind positive comments made by management, and trades at $92.24 versus its 52-week range of $72.60-$97.19, at a P/E multiple of 14.3x, and a forward P/E of 12x. Historically, FedEx has traded at an average one year forward P/E of 13x-19x. It's closest competitor United Parcel Service is trading at $72.95 versus its 52-week range of $66.46 - $81.79, at a P/E multiple of 16x, and a forward P/E of 14x. Just given valuation, FedEx looks rich from here, but we want to look into the fundamentals to see if they are priced into the valuation of the stock.So what will drive EPS growth from here? On its facility tour this week, management announced the Express operating improvement plan called ""Project Renewal."" This will include a $1.7 billion operating income improvement with $1.6 billion from Express. This is very good news as we see managements focus moving from just getting bigger to getting bigger, better, and more profitable. A lower cost structure will also provide a floor for the stock in a tough economic environment. Additionally, expect to see an improvement in margins in the long run. Currently, the company is targeting 10% plus margins at Express, and 20% plus at Ground.As always, we do want to point out the risks related to our investment ideas. Going forward, we would watch how higher oil prices will impact the company's profitability. Also, any delay in their cost cutting plans or a sizeable and dilutive acquisition might have a negative impact on EPS growth.Conclusion: Overall, FedEx has now become a name that has acquired a defensive approach to perform profitably in a weak economy. A dividend yield of 60 bps on the stock might not look attractive today, but the fundamentals might become a safe haven for those looking for a household name.The chart below compares share performance of FedEx and United Parcel Service versus the S&P 500 over the past year.

930471,29461,2012-10-17T15:08:30-04:00,,"Industrials, after expecting a slow growth in sales for this year, have started to think about cost restructuring in order to maintain their profit levels. Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), Navistar (NYSE:NAV) and Detroit automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are some of the examples in this regard. Cummins (NYSE:CMI), a truck engine manufacturer, announced the same in its press release released recently. Structural changes in FedEx (NYSE:FDX) were already being expected by the market for some time now. The announcement regarding cost savings was made during an investors meeting last week; this was one of the few catalysts mentioned in our report after the earnings release.Since the announcement, the stock is up around 6% since investors hardly expected such a big improvement in profits, which FedEx claims to make by 2016. Analyst high-end estimates of $1 billion were much lower than FedEx's announced $1.7 billion. The bottom line improvement will come from both revenue improvement as well as cost cutting. The company broke down the figure into five buckets, of which about $1.2 billion will come from cost-cutting initiatives, while the remaining will be generated through revenue growth within the Express division, from where the company already gets 62% of its total revenues.About $1.55 billion of the overall $1.7 billion improvement in profitability is expected to come from the Express division. FedEx has realized that people are no longer willing to pay more for an overnight delivery service. They would rather wait another day for the goods to be delivered, instead of paying a premium for quicker delivery. The important thing, according to the market, is that the change in customer preferences and attitude is one that has less, or nothing, to do with the recession. More or less, the change is secular, and therefore the structural change made by FDX will be a permanent one. The company will not revert to how it used to do things once the economy improves. According to the head of the Express unit, Dave Bronczek:""We look at the world differently now. We're more conservative.""An improvement of around $300 million will come from modernizing the air fleet. Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 757 and 767 planes will be used as replacements, which will allow fewer flights, and will carry more cargo than old fuel-inefficient jets. Another $350 million will come from changes in the domestic Express business, which includes replacements of 5,000 fuel inefficient vehicles.Companywide savings worth $1 billion will come from job cuts. Several thousand employees are expected to accept the voluntary buyout offered in August this year.International Business:It will be interesting to see when FDX expands its international business. It is quite against the norm of the industry, where businesses tend to solidify their local operations first and then think of expanding their international businesses. The recent announcement by Navistar, the truck and engine manufacturer, regarding curtailing a large part of its international business, is a case in point.However, the expansion announcement by FDX can be justified by the fact that the international side of its Express business is a growth story. The growth has come because of the recent business acquisitions in different parts of the world like Brazil, France and Poland. A senior VP of global marketing described the international business as the ""crown jewel"" of the company.The company will also expand its ocean shipping business, providing a larger variety of services, and will invest in improving its infrastructure in Europe. The company will use technology to boost efficiency across its operations.Conclusion:In the analyst meeting, FedEx reiterated the forecast that it had given in its last earnings release. Earnings are expected to be $6.2-$6.6, reduced from the $6.9-$7.4 figure given before the earnings release of the first quarter.It is important to note that the overall economy is not giving a clear signal. After all, economic growth boils down to one cause - consumer sentiment. Where FedEx has reduced its employees in anticipation of a negative consumer sentiment in the future, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), the retail giant, has announced that its back-to-school sales were strong, and annual retail sales are expected to grow by 7%, which obviously shows that consumer spending is on a rise.It is also obvious that many industrials are cutting down or have already cut down their costs to the bare minimum, and top-line growth will be needed to maintain profits in the future.After announcing expectations of massive improvement in profitability, Citi increased its price target from $99 to $108. Also, Standpoint upgraded FDX to buy. The announcement has led the market to favorably revise the multiples. Given the improvement in the cost structure of FDX's main business, the stock is recommended as a buy, as in our earlier thesis.Earlier on, we had a sell recommendation on the stock. The main reason behind that was the poor performance of FedEx's main segment - i.e. Express. Now that the company has decided to restructure the whole department, the stock is expected to go up and we are changing our recommendation to buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Industrial Analyst.

However, since fiscal 2009 earnings have begun growing again and stock price has recovered off of its lows. Nevertheless, its current PE ratio of 13.5 indicates that the company is modestly undervalued. The dividend growth investor might want to do their own due diligence into this company further for possible addition to their portfolio.About FedEx Corp: Directly from their websiteEarnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on FedEx Corp shows a slight picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 8.9% and a current PE of 13.5. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 13%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears undervalued, (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).FedEx Corp: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal PE Since 1998Performance Table FedEx CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return; capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 7.6% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of FedEx Corp, assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $119.87 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 7.6% to 7.9% per annum versus 3.8% (red circle) in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical PE ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio. The current price to sales ratio for FedEx Corp is .66 which is historically normal.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound, and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 24 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast FedEx Corp's long-term earnings growth at 13% (orange circle). FedEx Corp has low long-term debt at 8% of capital (red circle). FedEx Corp is currently trading at a P/E of 13.5, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, FedEx Corp's True Worth™ valuation would be $178.02 at the end of 2017 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would be a 13.4% annual rate of return from the current price (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in FedEx Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds, illustrates that FedEx Corp's expected earnings would be 7.4 (purple circle) times that of the 10 Year T-Bond Interest.

917561,25120,2012-10-11T03:34:44-04:00,,"Shares of FedEx (FDX) rose over 5% in Wednesday's trading session, in a general downbeat market. The global transportation company announced an ambitious program to significantly boost future profits.Profit Target ProgramFedEx unveiled programs which target to achieve a $1.7 billion improvement in annual profitability improvements during the next three years. The most significant portion of the benefits will be achieved in the fiscal year of 2016. The estimates, exclude the ongoing improvements at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight.At the same time, the company announced the retirement of David F. Rebholz, which has been president of FedEx Ground.Cost reduction initiatives are already underway and improved information-technology will be a main reason by which FedEx will be able to meet its cost reduction goals. Costs will be reduced in selling, general and administrative expenses, particularly in FedEx Services and FedEx Express.OutlookFedEx reaffirms its full year earnings outlook for its fiscal 2013. The company expects to earn $6.20-$6.60 per diluted share for the full year. Second quarter earnings are expected to come in between $1.30-$1.45 per diluted share.ValuationFedEx ended its first quarter of its fiscal 2013 with $2.7 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $2.4 billion in short and long term debt, for a modest net cash position.FedEx generated annual revenues of $42.7 billion for 2012, and most likely revenues will grow at a very modest pace in 2013. Full year earnings for its fiscal 2013, are expected to come in around $6.40 per diluted share.After Wednesday's gains of 5%, the market values FedEx at roughly $28.2 billion. This values the operating assets of the firm at $28 billion. As such, the market values FedEx at 0.6 times annual revenues and 14 times 2013s expected annual earnings.Currently, FedEx pays a quarterly dividend of $0.14, for an annual dividend yield of 0.6%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of FedEx have risen some 7%. Shares quickly advanced to levels around $97 in February and fell back to lows of $84 in recent weeks. Shares fell on the back of weak first quarter earnings which were accompanied by a soft second quarter outlook. The problems at the company express division are putting pressure on shares. Shares rallied back to $90 at the moment, on the back of the ambitious profit improvement plan.Over the past five years, shares of FedEx have lost some 15%. Shares fell to lows of $40 in the beginning of 2009, and recovered to $100 in 2011. While FedEx's share price has been under pressure over the past years, the company has boosted its annual revenues from $35.5 billion in 2009 to $42.7 billion in 2012. Net income rose from $98 million to $2.0 billion over the same time period.Wednesday's announcement came as a positive surprise to investors and analysts. The company unveiled to improve profits by $1.7 billion through the fiscal year of 2016. FedEx has merely three and a half years time to achieve these savings, implying annual cost savings of $500 million. In comparison, analysts from J.P. Morgan expected the company to guide for a profit plan of $400-$500 million.Assuming normal tax rates, the planned cost savings imply additional earnings per share of at least $1.00 per diluted share. Excluding organic growth, this implies annual earnings exceeding $7.50 by 2016. Investors are furthermore comforted by comments of CEO Smith, who says FedEx aims to increase future dividends. At the moment, the company pays a yield of a mere 0.6%.Investors were applauding FedEx's initiatives on Wednesday. The profit initiatives give a clear guidance for future earnings, which are expected to rise on the back of the significant cost savings. Besides earnings improvements, investors are also pleased with announcement of future dividend hikes.Shares of FedEx trade at a significant discount compared to its main competitors [[UPS]]. While the valuation has become much more appealing on a stand-alone basis, on the back of the initiatives, I am hesitant to take an outright long position. Investors who have a lower risk tolerance could set up the relative spread in the transportation industry by going long FedEx and short UPS.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company accounts for 2.0 percent of the S&P 500's Industrial sector and 12.5 percent of the Transportation and Logistics sub-sector and as such provides some indication of the U.S. market's future industrial production growth.The company gave its projections for future economic growth both domestically and internationally. The company's outlook predicted 2012 U.S. GDP growth of 2.2 percent, unchanged from its previous outlook, and 2013 U.S. GDP growth of 1.9 percent, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous quarter's outlook. Estimates for world GDP growth were 2.3 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent for 2013.Its 2013 U.S. GDP expectations are slightly below the Federal Reserve's projections which state a range of 2.3 to 3.5 percent GDP growth for 2013.FedEx also included estimates for industrial production, reporting it expected growth of 4.2 percent for calendar year 2012 and 3.0 percent for 2013, revised downward 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, from its previous quarterly announcement.The company's projections and first quarter earnings announcement dampened the outlook slightly on U.S. economic growth following the Federal Reserve's new actions for quantitative easing.FedEx reported Q1 2013 earnings of $459 million resulting in diluted EPS of $1.45. First quarter earnings were 1.1 percent below one year ago and 16.6 percent below the previous quarter. EPS, however, was consistent with the quarter's estimate of $1.45 to $1.60 per diluted share.Second quarter estimates appear to be primarily focused on the company's previous growth which has been contracting domestically and internationally. It estimated Q2 diluted EPS of $1.30 to $1.45 and reduced its fiscal year 2013 earnings estimate from $6.90 to $7.40 per diluted share to $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share.Given FedEx's weak outlook and heavy dependence on global economies the stock appears to provide a short sell opportunity. The stock fell 3.99 percent following the announcement compared to a 0.45 percent decline in the Industrial sector.The company's near term outlook appears to be based primarily on continuation of business results seen in the previous quarters and provides a more negative outlook for potential growth in domestic production than current market sentiment following the Federal Reserve's new monetary policy actions. Although the company's outlook and earnings growth estimates suggest the effects of QE3 may not cause the improvements that many speculators predict, the shipping company's expansive global business makes it difficult to interpret domestic versus international trends that may be emerging in industrial production.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenue grew 3% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, slightly better than consensus expectations. Earnings were also better than consensus estimates, falling just a penny from last year to $1.45 per share. We are sticking with our fair value estimate despite the lowered full-year outlook. For an in-depth look at FedEx's intrinsic value estimate based on a robust discounted cash flow analysis, please click here.FedEx blamed sluggish economic growth due to weak end market demand as the main driver of weakness. However, its customers are also opting for slower and cheaper shipping methods. FedEx Express, the firm's largest segment, saw revenue grow just 1% year-over-year to $6.6 billion, while operating income fell 28% to $207 million. U.S. domestic volumes fell 5%, though revenue per package increased 2%. International results in the segment were slightly stronger, but the category carries lower margins, and the company did not collect as much revenue from fuel surcharges.Meanwhile, FedEx Ground saw revenues jump 8% to $2.5 billion on 5% higher volume and increased average rates. Due to strength in e-commerce, operating income grew 9%, to $445 million. Freight revenues jumped 5% to $1.4 billion, with operating income increasing 114% to $90 million, thanks to operating efficiency gains and solid volume growth. The firm is seeing cheaper shipping options surge in popularity as customers are becoming less willing to pay up for quick delivery. We think the change is in part a result of constrained consumer spending, but also represents a symptom of gains in corporate supply chain management. Companies are becoming better at shipping packages in a timely manner, reducing order lag and the need for premium shipping options.Going forward, FedEx slashed its full-year earnings per share guidance to $6.20-$6.60 (excluding cost savings) from its previous range of $6.90 to $7.40, and well below the consensus estimate of $7.44. The firm also cut its second quarter guidance to $1.30-$1.45 per share, well below the $1.67 consensus estimate. However, the firm expects a net rate hike of 3.9% in hopes that better pricing will offset lower expected volumes. FedEx expects economic growth to deteriorate, though we're not convinced macroeconomic growth will remain materially weak for any extended period of time. Management noted that exports have fallen faster than GDP during the past few months, and they think oil prices will continue to rise, pressuring profits.After considering the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, a possible temporary shift in consumer behavior toward cheaper shipping options, and rising input costs, we think FedEx remains fairly valued at this time.

884041,25120,2012-09-24T09:33:44-04:00,,"Shares of FedEx (FDX) ended the week with losses over 6%. At the beginning of last week the transportation company announced its first quarter results for its fiscal 2013.First Quarter ResultsFedEx reported first quarter revenue of $10.79 billion, up 2.6% on the year. Analysts expected FedEx to report revenue growth of 1.7% to $10.70 billion. Operating earnings rose by 0.7% to $742 million, resulting in operating margin compression of 10 basis points to 6.9%. Net income fell by 1% to $459 million, resulting in a fall in earnings per share by a penny to $1.45. Earnings surpassed FedEx's own estimate of $1.37-$1.43 per share. Two weeks ago, FedEx lowered its original guidance of $1.45-$1.60 per share. Analysts expected FedEx to report earnings of $1.41 per share.CEO and Chairman Frederick W. Smith commented on the results:Segmental InformationExpressThe main express segment reported a 1% increase in revenue to $6.63 billion. Operating income fell by 28% to $207 million, resulting in operating margin compression of 130 basis points to 3.1%. Profitability came under pressure amidst falling US domestic package volumes. Demand for lower-yielding services and higher employee benefit expenses could not be offset by cost containment activities.GroundRevenues for the ground segment were up 8% to $2.46 billion. Operating income rose in line, increasing 9% to $445 million. Operating margins improved by 20 basis points to 18.1%. Ground volumes increased by 5% in both business-to-business and home-delivery systems.FreightThe freight segment reported revenue of $1.40 billion, up 5% on the year. Operating income more than doubled from $42 million to $90 million. Operating margins doubled to 6.4%. Profitability was driven by profitable volume growth, higher yields and operational efficiencies.OutlookFor the second quarter of its fiscal 2013, FedEx anticipates earnings per diluted share between $1.30 and $1.45. On average, analysts expected FedEx to guide for earnings of $1.61 for the current quarter.Full-year earnings are expected to come in between $6.20-$6.60 per diluted share. Earlier, FedEx expected full-year earnings to come in between $6.90-$7.40 per share. The guidance assumes the current outlook for fuel prices and does not include the impact of possible cost reduction programs. Analysts expected FedEx to guide for full-year earnings of $6.94 per share.ValuationFedEx ended its first quarter with $2.74 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $2.36 billion in short- and long-term debt, for a net cash position of almost $400 million.FedEx generated revenue of $42.7 billion for its full year of 2012. The company net earned $2.0 billion, or $6.40 per diluted share. Currently, the market values the firm at $26.5 billion, or $26 billion for the operating assets. The market values the firm at 0.6 times annual revenue and 13 times 2013's guided earnings.The valuation compares to a revenue multiple of 1.3 times for its larger competitor UPS (UPS). UPS trades at 18 times trailing annual earnings.Currently, FedEx pays a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.7%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of FedEx are trading unchanged. Shares advanced in February to highs of $97 per share, but fell back to $85 at the moment.Over the past five years, shares of FedEx have lost roughly 20% of their value. Shares traded as low as $40 in the beginning of 2009 and rose to almost $100 in 2011. Despite falling share prices, FedEx has boosted annual revenue from $35.5 billion in 2009 to $42.7 billion in 2012. Net income rose from $98 million in 2009 to $2.0 billion in 2012. Earnings per share rose from $0.31 to $6.40 per diluted share. Dividends rose slightly from $0.44 per annum to $0.56 per share, at the moment.Investors have grown a bit impatient with FedEx. While revenue and earnings have been on the rise for many successive years, investors hoped for more. The profit warning in September highlights the softening of the global economy as more firms have pointed out. Some quarters, it is high oil prices impacting results, other times it is lack of demand.While FedEx trades at a discount to competitor UPS, I remain on the sidelines. The valuation on a stand-alone basis is not appealing enough to justify a long position. Unless prospects for the economy and FedEx improve, or the company hikes its dividend, I will not pick up shares anytime soon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

874471,29461,2012-09-18T15:39:08-04:00,,"As predicted by Qineqt, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell 3% after the company slashed its outlook for the year. However, the company managed to top EPS and revenue estimates. The following table shows the summary of the earnings release.EPS estimates were slashed just a fortnight before the release, when FDX announced that it now expected EPS to be in a range of $1.37-$1.45, as compared to the earlier forecast of $1.45-$1.6. The slash came after its arch rival United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) lowered its 2012 earnings forecast and reduced its operating capacity in Asia in July, due to the global economic uncertainty.Similarly, the market had anticipated that the company's productivity enhancements plans would improve margins as well. However, after the EPS forecast was slashed, many gave up on that idea. The same was reflected in the release, as the margins were down 100bps YoY to 6.9%. However, what should not be forgotten is that margins did improve within the segments that have been discussed below.The continued improvement at FedEx Ground and Freight was offset by the Express division.FDX estimates earnings to be $1.3-$1.45 in the second quarter and $6.2-$6.60 for 2013. The earlier outlook stated an estimate of $6.9-$7.4.Following are the segment-wise revenues made by FDX:The following table shows the revenues, operating income and margin improvements in the first quarter of 2013.The following table shows the results in the previous quarter.After comparing both tables, it can be concluded that both revenue growth and operating income growth rates are falling over the passage of time. Companies like FDX are bellwethers of the economy, and therefore falling growth rates for these companies reflect the falling growth rate of the economy.FedEx ExpressThe decline in margins for Express is alarming. It shows that much of the voluntary buyouts were not availed. Also, the decline came because the slowdown in the economy had shifted consumer focus towards FDX's non-premium services, and the company has been unable to adjust the operating capacity of Express accordingly. This is worrisome for the company, as Express forms the largest division of the company, and accounts for over 60% of FDX's revenues. Another reason why margins declined was because the trend is shifting towards less-profitable international services.FedEx GroundE-commerce has been the key driver for this segment, which is why average daily volume of SmartPost rose by 18%. The overall average daily volume increased by 5% due to a rise in business-to-business transactions and Home Delivery Services.FedEx Freight SegmentThe segment's margins doubled due to continued improvement in operational efficiencies. Freight is the most-growing segment of the company, since the dynamics of LTL are favorable on a macro level. By this, we mean that pricing and growth are expected to remain stable in the future. It is expected to grow by 2.4% this year. Also, in the Transportation Conference held in New York last week, a majority of investors polled that after railroads and logistics, LTL is going to be the best performer in the Transportation Industry in the near future.2013 Rate IncreasesThe Express division is expected to raise the rates by an average of 3.9% for domestic, import and export services early next year. This has been planned primarily keeping in view the rise in fuel charges in the future. The pricing changes for Ground will be announced later this year. The Freight division has already undergone an increase in charges of 6.9% in July this year.October PlanFDX is expected to announce its restructuring plan, and the resulting financial impact on October 9 and 10 this year in a Transportation Conference. Analysts, on average, think that the expected savings from the plan will be around $480 million. Calculations show that $275 million in savings will add a 100 points to the margin. Therefore, total savings will bring an improvement of 175bps in the margin. It is interesting to note that 15% of the analysts were of the point of view that the savings will be around $650 million, which means a margin improvement of 236bps.ConclusionThe future does not seem to be clear for the company. Its main business, Express, has been declining. The decline in Express is cyclical rather than secular. People with lesser money in their pockets prefer cheap and slower modes of transportation, which is why FedEx Ground is improving and Express is getting a hit. Stocks like FDX and UPS are pure plays on macroeconomic conditions. FDX sees a global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2013, reduced from the previous estimate of 3%. For the U.S., it expects the economy to grow at 1.9%, rather than the earlier estimate of 2.4%.Nevertheless, the company has a strong balance sheet. The cash flows from operations are positive. The company has no debt issue. It is trading at a multiple of 10x. However, we firmly believe that there will be a better entry point for investor to buy the stock. Therefore, it is recommended that investors short the stock in the short run unless a powerful catalyst is in sight. The October meeting on cost cutting and efficiency program will be an important catalyst for the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Industrials Analyst.

871721,24706,2012-09-17T14:22:12-04:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinOverviewFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to report 1Q 2013 earnings before the bell on Tuesday, September 18. The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Profits from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. While the company has already telegraphed its outlook for the 1Q period, the guidance for the 2Q and full year could impact both the underlying shares and the broader market.Outliers & StrategyKey Measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSince succumbing to a 3-month low in response to the September 4 cut in its 1Q 2013 profit forecast, FedEx shares have climbed higher, retaking the 200-Day SMA near $89.00 along the way. If earnings guidance for 2Q 2013 surprises to the upside, look for resistance at the recent high near $93. Downside risk is support at $88.00, followed by the September low near $85.00. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryFedEx shares are moving higher ahead of the 1Q earnings release as the risk of rising fuel prices, softness in China, and the economic crisis in Europe appear priced into the shares, which are now fetching just 14.1x trailing earnings - a discount to rival UPS(18.3x). After having clearly telegraphed the weak outlook for 1Q 2013 back on September 4, much of the focus will center on the forecast for 2Q 2013 and the balance of the full year. Street estimates currently call for a slight reduction in the FY2013 outlook.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

866791,24491,2012-09-14T02:54:38-04:00,,"Although analyzing historical trends in dividend payments is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of FedEx (NYSE:FDX), as well as its dividend under this framework. If you are interested in an in-depth valuation assessment (both on a DCF and relative value basis) of FedEx, please click here.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalFedEx's DividendFedEx's dividend yield is well below average, offering 0.6% annual yield at recent price levels--it's also well below that of peer United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). As a general rule, we prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio -- they are just too low to be meaningful for the income investor.We think the safety of FedEx's dividend is excellent (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article), despite meager forecasted economic growth. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For FedEx, this score is an amazing 6.9, revealing that on its current path, the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. This is incredible. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by JC Penney (JCP)--it was 0.9--and Supervalu (NYSE:SVU)--it was -11. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of FedEx's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion,"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for FedEx. The company can cover its dividend payments nearly 7 times with future generated cash flow (over a five-year period) after considering its capital structure (net debt/cash position)!And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In FedEx's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.All things considered, we like the potential growth and safety of FedEx's dividend, but we'd wait for the yield to move higher before considering it in our income portfolio. The board should convene on this topic.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

865491,32001,2012-09-13T13:08:49-04:00,,"Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) reports fiscal first quarter 2013 financial results before the bell on Tuesday, September 18, with consensus analyst expectations of $1.41 for earnings per share (EPS) and $10.7 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth in revenues of 2% and a decline in earnings per share of 3%.The story of FedEx today is a complicated one. By segment, FedEx Express is the company's largest division at 62% of revenues (roughly two-thirds) but with just a 3% operating margin. There has been talk of the Express Division being restructured for some time, and the first substance of that restructuring could come with this earnings report, and the analyst conference in October.The problem with Express has been slowly declining volumes, costs, and a compression in the operating margin over the last five years, from over 9% as of May 2007 to just 3% - 5% today.On the positive side, the Ground segment, (competes with UPS), represents 22% of FedEx's total revenues and has an operating margin of 18%, but Ground's operating margin has been flat to growing since 2007, expanding from 13.5% in 2007 to 18.4% today. (Operating margin history is courtesy of a Jefferies research report dated June 20, 2012.)Last quarter (2012's fourth fiscal quarter, reported in mid-June 2012), FedEx beat on revenues, which grew 4% year-over-year, while earnings per share grew 16%. Express volumes fell 5% and even International Priority volumes fell 0.5%, as Express revenues rose 2.5%. Ground was again the star last quarter, as the operating margin expanded to 20% on volume growth of 3.5%. Ground revenues rose 9% year-over-year.The recent earnings warning by FedEx in early September, didn't impact the stock price too much, as the Q1 2013 earnings per share midpoint was reduced from $1.52 to $1.40.Last June, in our first ever article written for Seeking Alpha, we previewed FedEx's fiscal fourth quarter 2012 earnings report. Our headline was ""When Operating Leverage Becomes a Drag,"" and that really is the crux of the issue for FedEx. The expenses associated with Express have become a drag on operating income, as Express and I/P volumes have declined and prevents FedEx from reaching its operating nirvana of a 10% operating margin.The last time FedEx hit a 10% operating margin was May 2006, which by the way, coincides nicely with the last time the stock traded near $110 - $120 per share -- an all-time high for the share price. (See the chart below):From the above chart, we think FedEx has been building a long base, with one potential catalyst being the Express restructuring, and another being a drop in crude oil prices. Ultimately though, I think FedEx returns to its outperforming days when we get some semblance that global growth is on the mend.From a valuation perspective, the most compelling metric for FedEx is the 6(x) enterprise value (EV) to cash-flow valuation the stock sports at $88 per share, and the enterprise value to 4-quarter trailing sales of 0.66(x) isn't too shabby either.In addition, even with earnings per share estimates reduced in early September, the consensus earnings estimates are calling for 7%, 17%, and 14% earnings per share growth  on expected revenue growth of 5%, 6%, and 4% for fiscal 2013, 2014, 2015, respectively.The ironic part of the Express restructuring, which will likely happen in the next two months, is that FedEx's operating leverage could be enhanced, just as U.S. and global growth starts to accelerate, thereby improving FedEx's earnings delta from faster volume growth.We've long been a believer in the company and the brand, and we would add to current positions near $85 and $80.Disclosure: I am long FDX.

875051,34201,2012-09-19T02:30:32-04:00,,"Let me start with the good news first. FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX), the world's second largest package company, beat first-quarter earnings forecast on Tuesday. For the quarter ended August 31, 2012, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company reported earnings $459 million, or $1.45 per share, beating consensus forecast of $1.40 per share.The earnings beat is unfortunately the only thing to cheer about. FDX's first-quarter results from its Express segment as well as its outlook are disappointing, to say the least.FedEx had warned earlier this month that weakness in the global economy hurt revenue growth at FedEx Express during the first quarter. The Express segment is FDX's largest in terms of sales. In the first quarter, the segment's operating margin dropped to 3.1%, while operating income plunged 28%.The Express segment was hurt by a drop in U.S. domestic package volumes, and the demand shift towards lower-yielding international services.The weakening global economy has forced companies to slash the use of faster and costlier shipments. What is worrying is the weakness in the global economy is not going away anytime soon.In Europe, the move from the European Central Bank (ECB) to buy bonds of struggling euro zone economies bought some relief. The move has been effective in bringing down borrowing costs for Spain and Italy, but the euro zone crisis is far from over. There is increasing talk of Spain asking for a bailout. Even if the crisis is contained in the euro zone, the big question is where growth will come from. Until growth issues are addressed euro zone will continue to weigh down the global economy.China, the world's fastest growing major economy and perhaps the engine of global economic growth, is an even bigger worry. Recent economic data from China indicates that the world's second largest economy is seeing a sharp slowdown. While part of the slowdown can be attributed to policymakers' efforts to cool down the economy to contain inflation, the weakness in the euro zone and U.S., China's biggest export markets, has hurt growth rates significantly. What has been surprising is that Chinese policymakers have been reluctant to implement aggressive stimulus measures like they did in 2009 to boost economic growth.Finally, U.S. economic growth is likely to be anemic this year. QE3, which I believe was a correct decision by the Federal Reserve, has given some hopes. But as I said in my previous post, fiscal cliff is a major concern and if lawmakers in Washington D.C. do not act on the issue, the Fed's efforts will be neutralized. Also the effects of QE3 will take some time to have an impact on the real economy.With global economic outlook uncertain, it is no surprise that FedEx yesterday slashed its earnings outlook for the full fiscal year. FDX now expects fiscal 2013 earnings to be between $6.20 per share and $6.60 per share, which is down from previous forecast of $6.90 per share to $7.40 per share.For the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, FDX expects earnings to be between $1.30 per share and $1.45 per share, which is significantly below the $1.57 per share FDX reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Second-quarter earnings forecast are also significantly below the consensus estimate of $1.67 per share.FedEx's rival United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has also lowered its profit outlook for the full year.The big worry for FDX is the Express segment. The segment has been hit the hardest by the global economic slowdown, and it is also FDX's largest segment in terms of sales. Launch of new products from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) may help the company, but they are not likely to offset the negative impact from a weak global economy. Exports and trade have gone down at a faster rate than GDP has, said FedEx CEO Fred Smith during a conference call yesterday.FDX plans to implement cost cutting measures in the Express segment. FDX has been cutting costs over the past year, but the company is yet to reap any benefits from those measures. So, any measures the company takes in future will have to be drastic. That may help FDX in improving its margin. But the lack of demand will still hurt the company.If you are betting on FedEx right now, you are betting on significant and quick recovery in the global economy. And in the present environment, I don't expect a recovery anytime soon. Just to emphasize my point, FDX shares gained more than 103% between January 2003 and August 2007, the period when the global economy was growing at a brisk pace thanks to the credit fueled boom. In the same period, the S&P 500 gained more than 65%. But, between September 2007 and March 2009, when the global economy sank, FDX shares slumped 60.6%. So there you see how much of an impact the global economy has on FDX.While I do not expect the global economy to slump like it did post the U.S. housing market collapse, I do not expect a quick recovery either. And with FDX's fortune tied so closely to the state of the global economy, I am not putting my money on the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Great companies will return to form. Just look at  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Or, once upon a time, IBM (NYSE:IBM). Or even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).But will they be overnight sensations?None of those classic Comeback Kids were. Time unfolded slowly and traders who assumed instant gratification were hurt chasing the stock on the assumption that what is good and goes down is bound to come up. The operative question, though, is when?Remember: the four companies, the wanna-be-Comeback-Kids, all reported despairing news in recent days. Is trading that simple? Take a good company that reports bad news. Add water, mix and buy?With apologies to ""Best of Breeds"" and ""Dogs of the Dow"" theories everywhere, once stocks start reporting bad news, they tend to languish for a bit.Take a closer look at FedEx.On September 4, the company cut earnings guidance for the first quarter, which had just ended. The cited a weak global economy and said profits would come in at $1.37 to $1.43, significantly below previous guidance of $1.45 to $1.60.The stock got hit, falling down to a little above $86, but has been ascendant ever since. With Cramer's nod of approval, it closed yesterday at over $89. Problem is, outside of the knee-jerk confidence that bad things don't happen to good companies, what's the impetus for buying the stock now, in the short-run?FedEx has been an underperformer over the past year, in large part because the troubles that took down first quarter earnings are etched pretty deep: China's teetering economy; an overall move away from the more profitable express shipping; higher fuel costs; and an energy sapping need to restructure.What's the impetus for a turnaround over the coming days? Well, that's a good question and one without a fitting answer.Over the short-haul, FedEx is in a rut. It should be trading back down to at least where it was on September 4. It's rise is based on the easily-earned assumption that what is good and goes down must come up and that is misplaced, which is why today, we're going against the grain and suggesting selling FedEx.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

FDX also offers a small dividend, which is not threatened at all by its negative earnings call. The company's looking to be 10-20 cents per share lighter on earnings for the current quarter than earlier projections indicated.There is an assumption in current pricing that FedEx is more threatened by an economic slowdown than UPS, but that's not entirely true. FedEx has its own ground operation, just like UPS, and its Kinko's stores represent just as much of a retail presence as the UPS stores. FedEx grew up on document delivery, a market circling the drain, but it has long been growing in packages, and valuable packages can be lightweight.Analysts are blaming selling pressure for FDX on its strength in Europe and Asia. Europe is in a banker-driven recession that will continue until creditors are convinced to write-down some loans and that money is replaced in a negotiated way. Asia's slowdown is in sympathy with both Europe and the America's economic slowdown.But all these events point to looser money, as bankers work to stimulate economies as America's economy was stimulated in 2009. Growth, in short, will return. And Federal Express will be in a great position to take advantage of that growth.The most important growth industries of our time, such as pharmaceuticals and computing, require constant shipments of small samples under tight control. This is FedEx' meat. It actually has a better network for growth right now than UPS does, in my view, so it should be priced more in line with UPS.It's the class deliveries that will get the most growth in a global economy where intellectual property is king.This indicates FDX earnings will go higher, not lower, once the economic skies start to clear. Once you see a technical bottom in the stock, anywhere from the current price to $80, it's time to jump in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

725531,24945,2012-07-17T07:20:00-04:00,,"In FedEx's Q4 2012 earnings call, the company indicated it believes it can continue to improve earnings, margins, return on invested capital and cash flows in 2013. The company projects 2012 U.S. growth at 2% and at 2.4% for 2013. The company believes U.S. domestic and global economic conditions will be negatively impacted due to the European debt crisis. The company indicated FedEx's business is performing well in spite of the European debt crisis. Additionally, the company expects Asia's growth to slow as well. The company noted headwinds in pension expenses will hamper earnings growth in 2013.As evidence of FedEx's commitment to improving margins, the company is installing GPS devices on all its trailers and dollies in order to improve fleet management. A company moving as much stuff from A to B as FedEx, can improve overall efficiency significantly, via small improvements here-and-there.Further evidence of the company's focus on margins can be seen by FedEx's replacing older aircraft with new aircraft in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The company recently purchased an additional 19 B767-300 aircraft from Boeing (BA) in order to replace current MD-10 and A310-200 aircraft.In order to improve earnings, FedEx has acquired several companies of late including Polish company OPEC, French company TATEX and Brazilian company Rapidao Cometa. Rapidao Cometa is one of the largest transportation and logistics companies in Brazil, with revenues of more than $500 mill in 2011. Via these acquisitions, FedEX can increase revenues and expand the company's international exposure.FedEx's stock price took a dive late last year, and has recovered as shown below:With FedEx's earnings results in the rear-view mirror, and the company's insistence it can continue to grow in 2013, a bull-put credit spread is considered for the company. With the company's bullish comments, the stock should continue to perform well, at least until the next earnings are released. A bull-put credit can be entered for a net credit by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money. The goal is for the options to expire worthless, with the investor retaining the initial net credit as profit.Using PowerOptions tools, a bull-put credit spread was found with a potential return of 4.8% (94.9% annualized) as shown below:The specific put option to sell is the 2012 Aug 80 at $0.43 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Aug 75 at $0.20.TradeA profit/loss graph for one contract of the position is shown below:A management point of $83.50 is set for the position.

845941,29461,2012-09-04T17:59:32-04:00,,"In the long run, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a story of growing revenues, profitability, and margins both in the U.S. and across the globe. All of its four segments -- express, ground, freight, and services -- are expected to bring big business to the company.However, in the short run the mild economic situation in the U.S., the troubled European economy, soft demand from emerging economies, and a slashed outlook from one of its peers do not reflect optimism for FDX investors. The company has also announced it will offer voluntary buyouts, which shows that the company is planning to cut costs amid declining growth in revenues.Apart from the cyclical downturn, the transportation Industry is facing high fuel costs, which have put operating margins under severe pressure. The company is replenishing its fleet and is streamlining its operations, which is expected to save $900 million. Switching to natural gas powered vans is also a significant opportunity for the company to save costs, as natural gas prices have plummeted to record lows after the shale gas boom.The restructuring plan will take a couple of years before generating cost savings. Given the current circumstances, as explained above, and the fact that the company's closest competitor, United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), missed earnings this quarter, there is a solid chance that FDX will also follow suit. Therefore, the stock is recommended as a short until the earnings release.Earnings Preview and Peer AnalysisThe following are the expected earnings and revenue figures for the first quarter:The company has beaten earnings for the last four consecutive quarters. However, this time around, the economic circumstances are not as promising as before. The company's peers have also shown a bearish attitude toward the end markets. UPS cut its Asian network by 10% due to weak exports to Asia. It claims that U.S. GDP will grow by only 1% in the second half of the year. Therefore, it slashed its EPS forecast from $4.75-$5 to $4.5-$4.7. It also missed second-quarter earnings by 1.7%.FDX, although, has not been that bearish about the U.S. market. The management claims that there will be moderate growth in the economy. In June, it disclosed that it expects the U.S. economy to grow by 2.2%, higher than the 2.1% it predicted some three months earlier.Operations and OutlookThe following shows the operations of FDX and briefly state what they do:Click to enlarge images.The following shows the segment-wise revenue:The chart shows that Express is the most revenue generating unit of the company, which makes 70% of its revenues from the U.S.The following shows the operating income from each segment:The Services segment is incurring operating losses.Key DriversTwo important drivers for Express and Ground Deliveries are package yields and package volumes. Where volumes are the units of packages to be delivered, yield is the revenue per package. In this quarter, U.S. domestic volumes fell year over year due to a weak economy, while yields rose due to an increase in fuel surcharge and increased rate per pound. U.S. domestic yields rose by 10%, whereas international yields rose by 8% year over year.The following shows the performance of the division over the year:FedEx ExpressFDX is the world's largest express company. Not only this, it is the world's largest air cargo carrier with the most freight ton-kilometers flown. This segment accounts for the largest chunk of international revenues.The future seems to be bright for this segment. The division opened 38 stations in Europe this year, despite a weak economy in the continent. The yield rates are on the rise as well; they increased by 6% year over year this year. The division is focusing on improving margins by replenishing the air fleet to be replaced by more efficient Boeing (NYSE:BA) jets. The segment plans to replace 54 jets from 2014-18. The fleet replacement is discussed in detail below. The operating margin declined by 20bps to 4.8%. It is expected to rise due to productivity enhancements and cost cutting plans, such as voluntary buyout offers.FedEx GroundThis segment is growing the most in terms of market share, as the segment has managed to shorten transit times in the U.S. and Canada, by accelerating various lanes. This segment not only witnessed a 7% rise in yield, but also witnessed growth in volumes due to the competitive advantage it enjoys, as mentioned above. The market share also rose as the company managed to dramatically bring down package loss rates and damage claims.As a future outlook, revenues are expected to rise as the division manages to win a larger market share. It also plans to automate loading and delivery processes, which will lead to improved productivity. Capital expenditures are also expected to rise in the form of increased spending on purchases of vehicles. Operating margins improved by 280bps in 2012 to reach 18.6%.FedEx FreightThe yields improved by 7% in 2012. However, given the declining economy, the trucking business has been severely influenced. Fortunately, as compared to the normal Full Truck load carrier, the LTL version has been more immune to the recession. Still, shipments fell by 1% in 2012 for this division. The segment benefited from mild winters.Revenues are expected to rise as utilization rates improve on a global economic recovery. An increase in capex to achieve increased operational efficiency will help improve margins.Voluntary BuyoutsVoluntary buyouts were announced for employees of Express and Services. As already mentioned, the Express division is undergoing a heavy cost-cutting program, where vehicles are being replaced and the headcount is being reduced. The pool is a huge one. There are 102,000 employees in the domestic express business and 12,500 employees in services. The employee reduction program is a significant part of the company's overall restructuring policy. A 7%-9% acceptance rate of the pool is expected, which will lead to savings of $250 million per annum.Fleet ReplenishmentThe company wants to enhance operating margin from 7.7% to above 10% by switching from old airplanes to more fuel-efficient planes. The switch from 727s to 757s and MD10s to 767s is expected to bring in $250 million in five to six years by saving fuel and maintenance costs. FDX also plans to reduce its domestic fleet capacity by 10% by 2018, which will save an additional $950 million.Shale Gas Boom and the OpportunityThe declining natural gas prices and rising fuel prices have provided a massive opportunity for transportation companies to switch to the cheaper source of fuel. Following shows the potential savings that FDX can enjoy if it switches to the alternative fuel:(Qineqt's estimate. The aircrafts may not be run on natural gas. Given that FDX has a fleet of 40,000 pickvans, (at incremental $11,000) approximately incremental capex comes out to be $440 million. Incorporating that still gives a positive NPV.)ValuationsCompanies like FDX and UPS are bellwethers of the economy. Falling growth rates and volumes for FDX segments show the conditions that the economy is going through. FDX's return has underperformed the S&P 500 since the last three months.However, the company has no liquidity problems. Overall, margins are on a rise. The stock is almost 5% up year to date. It pays a dividend yield of 0.6%. The cash flow from operations is positive. The transportation business is evergreen and is only down because the U.S. economy is going through recessionary times. Having said that, it is also important to consider competitors' view, who have slashed this year's outlook and missed this quarter's earnings. Also, the recent buyout offers in FDX's largest division (Express) have made investors doubtful.The stock is trading a forward multiple of 10 times. The earnings are expected to increase by 14% per annum for the next five years. However, given the cyclical nature of the stock, chances are that there will be some better entry point for investors to take a long position in the stock. In this context, the earnings release on Sept. 18 will be an important catalyst. Given the current situation, the stock is recommended as a short until the earnings release.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Industrials Analyst.

838061,25036,2012-08-30T11:04:26-04:00,,"Transportation services company FedEx (NYSE:FDX) faired reasonably well in its previous quarter, in spite of slowing business in Europe. But, can FedEx continue to perform well with slowing in China as noted by Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), discussed here, in addition to slowing in Europe? Engine maker Cummins (NYSE:CMI), discussed in this article, confirmed slow growth in China, as well as slow growth in Brazil and India in its Q2 2012 earnings call held on July 31, 2012. It doesn't sound too good for FedEx with slow growth in Europe, China, Brazil and India.In FedEx's 2012 Annual report (pdf), 30% of the company's total revenues were generated internationally, so slowing growth in Europe, China, Brazil and India could put a pretty big dent in the company's earnings results to be reported in the upcoming quarterly earnings release/call scheduled for September 18, 2012. Additionally, in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, FedEx recently announced an offer for voluntary buyouts to eligible employees. Sounds like FedEx is preparing for a slowdown in business.FedEx's stock price is about where it was two years ago, after taking a plunge a year ago as shown below:With slow international growth and FedEx's upcoming earnings release/call, an investor in FedEx might consider entering a protective position for the company such as a collar/protected covered call. The protected covered call can be entered by selling a call option against a stock and using some of the proceeds from selling the call option to purchase a protective put option. The protected covered call positions for a potential return, even if the price of the stock remains stagnant, and protects in case the stock's price takes a dramatic drop.Using PowerOptions, a variety of protected covered call positions are available for FedEx as shown below:The top position with expiration in January of 2013 looks attractive with a potential return of 2.7% (6.9% annualized) and a maximum potential loss of 5.9%. The returns in the table above do not include consideration for expected dividend payments. The top position when considering expected divided payments has a potential return of 3% (7.7% annualized) and a maximum potential loss of 5.6%. So, even if the price of FedEx's stock drops all the way to zero, the maximum loss which can be sustained is 5.6%. The specific call option to sell is the 2013 Jan 87.5 at $5.25 and the put option to purchase is the 2013 Jan 80 at $2.97.FDX Protected Covered Call TradeA profit/loss graph for one contract of the FedEx protected covered call is shown below:For a stock price below the $80 strike price of the put option, the value of the protected covered call remains unchanged. For a stock price above the $87.5 strike price of the call option at expiration, the position experiences the full potential profit of 3% (7.7% annualized). If the price of the stock increases to above $95, then the position can most likely be rolled in order to realize additional potential profit.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

863281,35301,2012-09-12T15:09:48-04:00,,"With recent developments in China, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is now poised for massive growth over the next five years. FedEx stock had a major crash and recovery in the second half of last year. If you had been able to time that perfectly you might have made some significant money. But FedEx has been predominantly flat over the last couple years. All that is about to change.FedEx and UPS (NYSE:UPS) were recently granted the ability to conduct business in China without regional partners. This is a huge step forward into a vast and growing market. FedEx forecasts that the delivery market in China will grow by 400% between 2012 and 2020, eventually exceeding $26 billion.FedEx and UPS have been forced in the past to form partnerships with local Chinese companies to handle package shipments. That will no longer be the case. However, there is one major caveat to this decision. FedEx was only granted the right to ship independently in eight Chinese cities, though this list does include major cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.Though China might be trying to box in FedEx and UPS and keep them from competing too much with the market leader China Postal Express, I still see this as a positive step forward and a chance for FedEx to expand its current $43 billion in revenues.I believe this development moves FedEx into the category of a stock worth buying immediately before the market begins to reflect the profit and revenue growth brought on by investment in China.Why Buy now?First, FedEx already has a larger market share then UPS in China through various local partners in roughly 400 cities. UPS is just getting into the game in China and because of that was granted access to only five Chinese cities compared to FedEx's eight. This disparity will only provide further room for FedEx to distance itself from its American competitor.Second, with the growing presence of online shopping, FedEx's estimates of the size of the delivery market may be far too low. Consider this, there are currently 193 million online shoppers in China and this number is growing rapidly. With such a large online retail market, there are currently 16 million packages shipped in China per day. To put this in perspective, FedEx's total global operations currently ship only about seven million packages per day. Reuters recently mentioned that Alibaba, China's largest online company, expects its sales to grow to almost $500 billion within the next seven years and has bragged that by the end of 2012 its online sales will be greater than eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) combined. Having secured a large chunk of this huge Chinese shipping market, FedEx can now grow and expand as the market around it continues to grow and expand.Finally, FedEx had good fundamentals over the past year and these should only improve with new expansion into China. Revenues grew by 9% from 2011 to 2012 and net income grew by 40%. As noted in FedEx's 2012 annual report, the revenue growth was led by volume growth in foreign markets, most notably Asia. I expect Asia to continue to lead volume growth over the next five years.CounterpointsFirst, FedEx could have difficulty competing with the larger and more established China Postal Express. Second, the Chinese e-commerce sites might be more disposed to utilize a local Chinese company. In addition, UPS could find ways to grow rapidly and steal market share from FedEx. Finally, in the annual statement FedEx acknowledges that the debt crisis in Europe could hinder market growth not only in Europe but also in Asia.ConclusionThere hasn't been a lot of reason to get excited about FedEx recently. It doesn't have a huge media following like Google or Apple and the stock has hardly moved all year. Be that as it may, FedEx is poised for massive growth. This is an investment for a patient investor happy to sit back and let the rising tide in China lift the stock for the next several years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

671361,22600,2012-06-20T06:02:23-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is probably my favorite earnings report, for many reasons. Not only is it a good bellwether, but the FDX report is truly the start of earnings season. For someone who used to wake up at 3AM to trade earnings reports back in another life, FedEx was always the start of the exciting news reporting season. This is when the corporate profit reporting season starts to get interesting. I guess we can say that FedEx started things off with tempered optimism (don't you hate terms like that? As my old partner at Merrill used to say – ""pick a side, Cullen!""). Here are the key takeaways from the FDX report (click here for the conference call transcript):FDX is still expanding margins modestly. This is an interesting development given the broad expansion in margins across corporate America. We'll have to see how margins hold up as the reporting season continues. The current margins are certainly not sustainable.We're still seeing tepid revenue growth. At 4%, the Q4 earnings were in-line with last year's growth rates. If the global economy continues to slow and the fiscal cliff materializes, the risk here is to the downside-- which will translate directly to the margin squeeze.Global growth is slowing. FedEx expects just 2.6% global growth versus its expected estimate of 2.9% at the beginning of the year. U.S. growth is still at its 2012 expected rate of 2.2%. Obviously not great, but not a downgrade either.The company's outlook disappointed. I wouldn't be surprised to see this become a more pervasive trend as the earnings season goes on. The recent turbulence in China and Europe is going to favor easing up on expectations, so don't be surprised if corporate America isn't offering the most optimistic outlooks into the future. The outlook is just too unclear, so the prudent move for executives will be to set the bar low.Disclosure: No positions"
782481,24063,2012-08-06T01:45:10-04:00,,"By Matt DoironBoard member David Steiner filed with the SEC to report that on August 2nd, he had bought 5,000 shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX). Steiner purchased the shares at an average price of $87.65, and the stock closed on August 3rd at close to $90 per share. We track insider buying activity because statistically it tends to be a bullish signal. So while the stock has risen slightly in the short time since Steiner's purchase, it may have further to go. The $28 billion global shipping company has underperformed the S&P 500 so far this year and is up about 5%. Steiner is also the CEO of Waste Management (NYSE:WM), having joined FedEx's board in 2009.Steiner joins a number of fund managers who are long FedEx Corporation. Southeastern Asset Management, managed by Mason Hawkins, owned 12.3 million shares of the company at the end of March. Southeastern had substantially increased its position in the summer of 2011. Edgar Wachenheim's Greenhaven Associates reported owning 4.4 million shares, making it the largest holding in the fund's portfolio according to the 13F filing. Columbus Circle Investors increased its position in Fedex Corporation by 18% to 1.6 million shares, compared to about 1.3 million at the beginning of the year.FedEx Corporation beat earnings in all four quarters of its last fiscal year, which ended in May 2012. Compared to its previous fiscal year, revenues were up 9% and net income rose about 40% (from under $1.5 billion to just above $2 billion). Growth occurred in the Express, Ground, and Freight segments of the company, with the largest contributor to the earnings increase being Ground, increasing its operating income by $439 million. This growth was partly driven by average daily Ground package volume growing by 4% and revenue per package rising 7%; each appears to be on an upward trajectory. FedEx has also been able to hold down many of its expenses, with salaries and employee benefits (the company's largest operating expense) only rising 5% - a little over half as rapidly as revenues.FedEx, despite its historical growth, now trades at only 14 times trailing earnings with expected growth from analysts bringing its forward multiple under 11 and could be considered a value stock. It should be noted that with a beta of 1.4, FedEx (as might be expected of a transportation company) is exposed to broader fluctuations in the economy and stock market. Larger rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) grew its earnings 5% in its most recent quarter compared to the same period last year and trades at considerably higher multiples - 19 times trailing earnings and between 14 and 15 times forward earnings. The company does, however, have a beta of only 1 and pays a 3% dividend yield. We asked if UPS is a good stock to buy last week. After studying FedEx in more detail and observing the insider purchase, we would recommend FedEx over UPS as a better value at this time.Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) and CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW) are also peers. These companies pay dividends between FedEx's and UPS's. Expeditors saw a 15% fall in earnings in its last quarter compared to the same period in 2011, and C.H. Robinson saw low earnings growth on the same basis. Both companies trade at 17 times forward earnings estimates. We think that FedEx is a better value than either of these companies, and a pair trade in which one of them is sold short would be one possible way to offset some of the risk of going long FedEx.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
679181,24491,2012-06-22T18:44:43-04:00,,"On Tuesday, global package shipper FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported strong results for its 2012 fiscal year fourth quarter. Net of a non-cash impairment charge related to the retirement of several aircraft, earnings per share for the fourth quarter grew to $1.99 from $1.75 (compared to a consensus estimate of $1.92). Net of this impairment, the firm's operating margin increased 60 basis points to 9%, on revenues of $11 billion (up 4% on a year-over-year basis). At current levels, we think FedEx is fairly valued on the basis of our DCF process (click here for our DCF valuation model template). Plus, the firm scores a 4 on our Valuentum Buying Index, indicating we aren't too excited about allocating new capital to the company at this time. Please click here to download a presentation on how to interpret our Valuentum Buying Index rating.The FedEx Ground segment experienced another strong quarter, with revenue advancing 9% to $2.48 billion due to increased yield and volume. Daily package volume for the segment grew 3% compared to the same period a year ago. FedEx Freight, a lower margin segment, saw 7% revenue growth and a near doubling of operating income thanks to strong yield and volume growth, as well as increased operational efficiencies. FedEx Express, the company's primary source of revenue, saw its revenue grow 3%, but that was offset by lower profitability, which sent operating income down 3% in the segment.According to management, the lower profitability in FedEx Express is due in part to an aircraft impairment charge and a larger-than-usual lag between fuel price increases and surcharges. Surprisingly, the firm hasn't seen much weakness in Europe, where it continues to make strategic acquisitions and witness FedEx Express outperform quarter after quarter. Rather, weakness has actually come from Asia, where changes in how tech companies have handled launches have negatively affected business. Management also noted a strong trend away from traditional air freight to ocean freight.Going forward, the company guided to earnings per share for fiscal year 2013 of $6.90-$7.40 (versus consensus expectations of $7.39 per share), which assumes US GDP growth of 2.2% and global GDP growth of 2.6% during fiscal year 2013. Though its earnings guidance may seem low relative to consensus, management did not account for cost-savings initiatives that will take place during the year. Specifically, the firm will see savings from more fuel-efficient aircraft and may see better pricing as industry-wide supply may fall. We view these potential developments together as a significant positive for operating margins. Though management delayed some Boeing 777 (NYSE:BA) purchases in fiscal year 2012 as a result of acquiring 767s on favorable terms, the firm's capital expenditure spending should remain at the same level during fiscal year 2013.We provide management's comments during the conference call about its view on the domestic and global economies, respectively:""FedEx's economic outlook calls for moderate growth to continue in the U.S. and global economy. Our forecast calls for calendar year '12 U.S. GDP growth to be 2.2% and industrial production growth to be 4.3%. For calendar year '13, we expect GDP growth of 2.4%, and our outlook is largely in line with the consensus economic forecast. We expect calendar year '12 world GDP forecast to be 2.4%. It's important to point out that successful management of the debt crisis in Europe and the avoidance of significant tax increases next year in the U.S. are important assumptions in our forecast.""Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
666021,27081,2012-06-18T10:08:24-04:00,,"Companies often play economist, offering up their best-wild-guess predictions on worldwide economic growth. Over time, most corporations playing the role of economist have performed even worse than real ones. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) stand, though, as exceptions. When they talk, traders tend to listen.That's why you need to watch out for what FedEx says about the European economy when FedEx reports their fourth-quarter before the open of trading tomorrow.It could really hurt the stock, and the public's perception of troubles in Europe, which have only recently started to reflect the ominous underlying reality.FedEx slowed its outlook for Europe back in March, lamenting that the pace of the economy was not what they envisioned, but still, their disappointment was measured. There was hardly a sense of foreboding. Their third quarter actually exceeded expectations and the package delivery giant's fourth-quarter forecast came in only slightly light, mostly because of Europe.Alan B. Graf, FedEx's chief financial officer said: ""The fourth quarter is still very good,"" before adding: ""We just don't have as strong an economy as we would have hoped it would be a year ago.""Europe, they said, would fall into a mild recession.In the three months since, though, hope that Europe's troubles would prove a fleeting proved delusion. Europe is currently in an environment of make-or-break elections, record high bond rates, 25% unemployment in areas and, all over, Greece saying it's no Spain, which, in turn, says it's not Portugal and all everyone can agree on is that they are all not Ireland.Europe is bad and getting worse-with systematic troubles that haven't fully been acknowledged, let alone addressed. When FedEx puts on their respected economist's hat and finally turns more serious than their formerly mild concerns about Europe, plenty will take it to heart. That will make FedEx-and United Parcel System (NYSE:UPS) tough places to be and will prove jarring to the market, which for months has been trying to will Europe into normalcy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
666311,32001,2012-06-18T11:18:39-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is scheduled to report their fiscal Q4 '12 earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, June 19th, with analyst consensus expecting $1.92 in EPS on $11.1 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 10% in earnings per share and 5.5% in revenues.The consensus EPS estimate has remained steady at $1.92 since the March release of the February '12 quarter, while the revenue estimate for Q4 '12 has been cut by about $50 ml since March, or ½ of 1%.FDX's stock has languished the last few quarters, thanks to slowing markets in Southeast Asia and China and higher jet fuel prices. Although the recent drop in crude might benefit FDX's fiscal 4th quarter, since the fuel surcharge operates with a lag - and thus as crude and jet fuel have fallen in 2012 - FDX might get a little margin benefit.It is an interesting comparison between FDX and UPS (NYSE:UPS): If you think the economy will remain sluggish and growth unevenly, UPS is actually the better buy-and-hold, given UPS has a better balance sheet and less operating leverage. FDX is more of a pure play on a stronger economic recovery since the stock price performance correlates closely with volume growth, and given FDX's operating leverage, an investor gets better upside from a given percent change in revenues in FDX than UPS.By division, Fed-Ex Express is still the bread and butter at FDX, representing 2/3 of revenue but about half of total operating income. But the problem for a while has been volumes: Express volumes fell 4.5% in the February quarter, and were also negative the prior two quarters before that. In fact, a research note out of Credit Suisse noted that Domestic Express volumes have fallen 4 of the last 6 years, and Credit Suisse is looking for a 4% contraction in fiscal 2012, which would make it 5 of the last 7 years.FedEx Ground, which has only been around about 10 - 12 years, has been gaining share from UPS and represents about 25% of FDX's total revenue, but over half of operating income. Ground has been a star for some time for FDX, with revenue growth in the mid-teens the last year.One pleasant surprise recently announced on Monday, June 11, 2012: FDX Freight (12% of revenues and currently not breaking even) announced a 6.9% rate hike. Freight which has been a drag on earnings and operations, might start contributing to operating income (finally).Since DHL dropped out of the market, the competitive balance between FDX and UPS has remained pretty rational, allowing for yields to remain healthy and the industry to remain stable. Both FDX and UPS can earn reasonable returns on capital in this economy and both are operating rationally despite the economy.Still, FDX could announce a restructuring on Tuesday, given the slower growth. They have already announced they are mothballing planes.As a stock, FDX is pretty cheap at 6(x) enterprise value to cash-flow and trading at about 0.6(x) price to 4-quarter trailing sales, with 16% and 14% earnings growth expected in fiscal 2013 and '14, and the stock trading with a 14(x) multiple, but other than sharply lower oil prices, we probably need to see faster economic growth and volume improvement to drive the stock.Technically, FDX would be a lower risk buy near $80. FDX is up about 1% year-to-date (as of the 6/12 close) excluding the dividend.Bottom line, I think the transport giant is treading water given the uncertain economy and the slowing overseas growth, and waiting for Express volumes to improve. We'd add more to our current positions near $80 per share or the 200-week moving average, since FDX is one of our industrial / transport core portfolio names, but the stock is really a better play on stronger economic growth, and that might not happen until the election is done.Disclosure: I am long FDX."

The title of a Wall Street Journal article says it all: ""FedEx Promises Cost Cuts As Volume Falls."" As a shipping company, FedEx is an important proxy for economic activity.But a closer look at the numbers in FedEx's report reveals some important considerations.FedEx Ground posted increases in both package volume and revenue. FedEx Ground is an important economic bellwether for the U.S. because it's responsible for domestic shipping from e-tailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others. According to Wikipedia: ""FedEx Ground now provides one- to five-day delivery of small packages to all 50 states, plus Canada.""While international volumes didn't do so well, the FedEx Ground segment did fine. From pg. 12 of the report:Click to enlarge image.As it turns out, daily package volume in the domestic segment of FedEx actually increased. While international shipping was hit by fallout from the euro crisis, consumers in the U.S. were still happily purchasing products.This data from FedEx mirrors that provided by UPS (NYSE:UPS) on April 26, when it reported its first-quarter earnings. For the quarter, U.S. domestic revenue increased 6.1%, driven by daily volume growth of 4.5%.This bolsters the point I made in my previous article, ""Rally Or Collapse: What To Expect From The U.S. Stock Market Through Year End."" The U.S. is doing fine, and U.S. companies in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) look great in comparison to those in Europe.

The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Profits from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Last quarter, FedEx shares slipped, despite a significant beat on EPS, as revenues came in shy of consensus and guidance for the 4Q 2012 period was toward the low end of Street forecasts.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSince the lead-up to its previous earnings release (March 22), FedEx shares are off close to 10%. Despite the pullback, the shares held key support just above $86 - a level going back to the end of last year. Should earnings and guidance surprise to the upside, look for resistance near the 50-Day SMA at $88, followed by $90. Conversely, support is at the 200-Day SMA near $85 (50-Week SMA), followed by the recent intraday low of $84, and $80.

Meanwhile, recent restructuring efforts, a slight boost in the dividend, a solid stand at $86 technical support, and price increases in North America are positive indications pointed toward a possible rebound if results top estimates.

Aggressive investors could take a position here, but more conservative investors may want to wait for a more attractive entry point.Dividend Contender: FedEx CorpThis article looks at FedEx Corp, a Dividend Contender, through the lens of the F.A.S.T. Graphs™ Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, the reader will be provided the ""essential fundamentals at a glance"" expressed vividly in pictures. In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live, fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs Found Here. (Tip: Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life).A Dividend Contender is defined as a company that has increased its dividend for a minimum of 10 - 24 straight years. FedEx Corp is a Dividend Contender that has raised its dividend every year for 10 consecutive years. The complete Dividend Contenders list is compiled courtesy of David Fish. (Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Contender list).About FedEx Corp: from their websiteFedEx Corp: A Dividend Contender with 10 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesLearning from the Past - Looking at Earnings OnlySince dividends are paid out of earnings, a clear perspective of a company's historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor's prudent due diligence process. The following graph plots FedEx Corp's earnings per share since 1998. A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that FedEx Corp has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 6.7% (see purple circle on graph) per annum.Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income: The following earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income. The earnings growth rate line or True Worth ™ line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Since dividends are paid out of earnings, and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at, they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line. Therefore, a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed:1. The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide.2. The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends (payout ratio).The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs. Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance. Therefore, the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values. Instead of opinion, this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit.Performance Table: Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income FedEx CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return: Capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 7.8% capital appreciation (Closing Annualized ROR), long-term shareholders of FedEx Corp would have received an additional $10,283.50 in dividends that increased their total return from 7.8% to 8% per annum.(Note: Since this is a Dividend Contender it has raised its dividend every year for at least 10-24 years, therefore, negative dividend growth rates shown, if any, will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company's regularly reported dividend rate)The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio (the dark blue line) correlated with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1998.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio. The current price to sales ratio for FedEx Corp is .67, which is historically normal.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns, and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore, forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound, and profitable performance.Therefore, it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done. At its current price, which is attractively aligned with its True Worth™ valuation, FedEx Corp represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Contender at a reasonable price. The important factor is that FedEx Corp has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price. This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 25 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast FedEx Corp's long-term earnings growth at 15%. FedEx Corp has low long-term debt at 10% of capital. FedEx Corp is currently trading at a P/E of 18.2, which is outside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, FedEx Corp's True Worth valuation would be $170.64 at the end of 2017, which would be a 14.1% annual rate of return from the current price, including assumed dividends.Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in FedEx Corp to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that FedEx Corp's expected earnings would be 7.6 times that of the 10-Year T-Bond Interest. (See EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.This report presents essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" on Dividend Contenders FedEx Corp, illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts. Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company, it's imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not. Follow the link we provided at the beginning of this article to a fully functioning F.A.S.T. Graphs™ on FedEx Corp.Summary & ConclusionsAlong with their packages, FedEx has been delivering strong earnings growth, although slightly erratic, since the great recession. Furthermore, expectations are that earnings growth should continue at an above-average rate over the next 5 years. Although the company does pay a modest but growing dividend, FedEx is more of a growth story than an income opportunity. Therefore, prudent investors may be better off waiting for a slightly more attractive price.

585621,20725,2012-05-14T03:50:21-04:00,,"Transportation stocks usually lead the market out of a recession and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has acted very toppy for the past few months. This probably means bad news for the market but may provide an opportunity for investors. Just the trailing valuation metrics suggest that the stock is fairly valued while analysts and the forward P/E valuations suggest that the stock is undervalued. As the jobs figures keep improving, another stock market leg higher should take FedEx higher. Below is an in depth look at the valuation metrics and the stock chart.Valuation: FedEx's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is fairly valued as there is a mixed message about the valuation metrics compared to their 5 year averages. FedEx's current P/B ratio is 1.7 and it has averaged 1.8 over the past 5 years with a high of 2.7 and low of 0.9. FedEx's current P/S ratio is 0.7 and it has averaged 0.7 over the past 5 years with a high of 1 and low of 0.4. FedEx's current P/E ratio is 13.7 and it has averaged 19 over the past 5 years with a high of 25.5 and low of 13.9.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow FedEx is $107. That is upside of 22% from today's stock price of $87.8 and suggests that the stock has some upside from here, considering FDX's market cap.Forward Valuation: FedEx is currently trading at about $88 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $7.44 next year, an earnings increase of 15% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 11.8. Taking a look at the company's publicly traded comparisons will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is currently trading at about $76 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $5.53 next year, an earnings increase of 14% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 13.8. C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) is currently trading at about $61 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $3.29 next year, an earnings increase of 14% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 18.5. Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD) is currently trading at about $39 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.13 next year, an earnings increase of 16% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 18.2. The mean forward P/E of FedEx's competitors is 16.8 which suggests that FedEx is undervalued relative to its publicly traded competitors.Earnings Estimates: FedEx has beat EPS estimates every time in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between 1 cents and 20 cents from consensus estimates or about 0.7% to 14.8% from analyst estimates. The company has reported earnings that have differed from analyst estimates by a wide margin which suggests that the stock may experience upside from earnings surprises.Price Action: FedEx is down 5.8% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 2.5%. Looking at the technicals, the stock is currently below its 50 day moving average, which sits at $90.34 and above its 200 day moving average, which sits at $83.90.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In this article, let's walk through how to analyze FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) valuation. Before reading on, please click here to view a short video on how to interpret the analysis that follows.FedEx posts a VBI score of 4 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish techniicals. We use CH Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW), Expeditors Intl (NASDAQ:EXPD), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), and Uti Worldwide (NASDAQ:UTIW) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on FedEx imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsFedEx 's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 13.4% during the past three years.The firm is trading at attractive valuation multiples relative to peers, but our DCF process indicates a less compelling opportunity. We'd wait for a clearer signal on valuation before jumping into the firm's shares.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $63, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:FedEx 's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.1% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 13.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx, cash flow from operations increased about 47% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 40% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur estimated fair value of $84 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 7.6% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.8%, which is above FedEx 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, we use a 11.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $84 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $63 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $105 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $84 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $116 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $84 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
449621,20568,2012-03-21T16:29:01-04:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX),  the world's second-largest package delivery company, is slated to  release its third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings on March 22, before  market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter  is $1.36, representing a substantial 67.84% annual growth.With respect to surprises, FedEx had a 0.78% average positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters.At its second quarter 2012 conference call, FedEx projected adjusted  earnings in the range of $1.25 to $1.45 per share for the third quarter.  The company also reaffirmed its fiscal 2012 earnings projection of  $6.25–$6.75 per share based on rising fuel prices and moderate economic  growth.Second Quarter FlashbackFedEx’ adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago earnings on the back of strong revenue growth.Total revenue improved from the year-ago quarter but was lower than the  Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year improvement was attributed  to continued improvement in FedEx Ground, healthy performance by FedEx  Freight and strong yield initiatives.Fuel costs spiked 28% during the quarter and were responsible for higher operating expenses.Agreement of AnalystsEstimates reflect a negative bias for the third quarter over the last  30 days with 2 out of 21 analysts revising their estimates downward.  None of the analysts made any positive revision over the last 7 and 30  days.Fiscal 2012 estimates reflect an upward bias. Out of the 23 analysts, 1  and 2 made positive revisions in the last 7 and 30 days, respectively,  while 2 analysts moved in the opposite direction in the last 30 days.The analysts made downward revisions primarily due to surging fuel  prices and lower mail volumes, which declined more than 20% since 2006  because of increased reliability on electronic communication.With the drop in mail volumes, FedEx’ revenue from postal service is  expected to shrink to less than a billion annually. The future of FedEx  largely hinges on its Express segment, which is also affected by weak  Asian demand. Nevertheless, the company is realigning its network  capacity to match weak international volumes due to the drop in Asian  demand.FedEx Express is taking several initiatives including reducing flights  and frequencies as well as redeploying equipment in other networks to  reduce costs. FedEx expects a multibillion-dollar investment in new  aircraft to provide significant fleet efficiency gains and benefit the  Express division over the long term. Further, strong package shipments  and higher prices are expected to offset rising fuel prices.Moreover, the recent deal to acquire TNT Express by its largest rival United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS)  serves as a major headwind to FedEx. United Parcel will become the  global leader in the logistics industry with annual revenues of more  than €45 billion ($60 billion) post-acquisition and will enjoy around  16% market share in Europe. FedEx has only 3% of market share in Europe.However, the network restructuring program would enhance FedEx’s competitive position against United Parcel throughout Asia.Magnitude — Consensus Estimate TrendThe magnitude of revisions for the third quarter has been static at  $1.36 per share over the last 7 and 30 days. The fourth quarter  expectation is within management’s guidance range.For fiscal 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $6.38, unchanged over  the last 7 and 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 is also  within management’s guidance and reflects a significant 30.27% gain year  over year.Neutral RecommendationDespite moderate economic growth, we believe earnings and revenue will  continue improving going forward on strong demand, better pricing,  continued yield (revenue per package) improvement, industrial production  growth and diminishing cost headwinds. Further, solid international  Express growth from rightsizing capacity, market share gains at Ground  and a profitable Freight business from network restructuring should lead  to further earnings improvement.However, increased investments, competitive threats,unionized workforce  and steeper fuel prices could limit the upside potential of the stock.We are maintaining our long-term Neutral recommendation on FedEx.

Keep your eyes peeled.FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is due to report its earnings on Thursday and you can set your watch by this: traders and the media will be flapping their gums about how the delivery giant is an economic bellwether, a harbinger of whatever is to come in the economy.You, though, need to operate on a deeper level. Even though the quick-hit conclusions about FedEx's earnings will probably skip it over, there are several new dynamics at play.The growth rate of air freight is far outpacing economic growth. Pick your survey or statistic, but online retail is exploding, taking an ever-increasing share of the retail market, with FedEx - and UPS - direct beneficiaries. But this secular change in consumer behavior means that FedEx is less of a straight economic indicator. It's in the right place at the right time. That takes nothing away from FedEx (quite the contrary) but it means it does not stand for the entire American economy. Old habits die hard, though, so you'll still hear a lot of the bellwether nonsense. Do your best to ignore it. It can only serve to mislead.FedEx profits have benefited in recent quarters (last June comes to mind in particular) from cost cuts, but flush profits based on cost cuts are a second class to citizen to profits based on something sustainable, like growth. Make the distinction, even when others do not. And never confuse a cost-cut quarter from one that says a lick about economic growth.Keep your eyes peeled for the impact of higher shipping rates, which say more about FedEx strategies than the larger issue of economic growth.If you want to try to get a bead on the U.S. economy, you are probably better off examining Nike (NYSE:NKE), which also reports Thursday. But if, for old time's sake, you want FedEx to stand as a bellwether, do it with a more impressionistic view than in the past. Look at its U.S. shipments numbers. If (taking, for convenience sake, last June again) they are flat as a pancake, well, that bodes poorly for the American economy. With the inexorable move toward online shopping and all the extra shipping that entails, FedEx needs to show considerable growth in U.S. shipments to say anything decent about the American economy. There's no longer a direct relationship. No matter what everyone says this week about FedEx being a classic bellwether, it is anything but. Don't be fooled by all the chatter you hear. It is little more than a product of the past, dated perceptions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
438601,23209,2012-03-16T08:55:12-04:00,,"Here we present a tentative model for the evolution of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock price. The best CPIs are selected from a set of 92 CPIs with estimates available from 2000 (one may extend this set). The best fit (in the LSQ sense) consumer price indices are that of food and beverages (F - CUUS0000SAF) and the index of communication (CO - CUUR0000SAE2). The latter index is directly related to FedEx and the former one seems to be mainly independent and evolving according to own forces. The defining time lags are as follows: the food index leads the share price by 3 months and the CO index leads by 5 months:FDX(t) = -4.87F(t-3) - 5.09CO(t-5) + 26.50(t-1990) + 1039.05, February 2012where FDX(t) is the FDX share price in U.S. dollars, t is calendar time. Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002. Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for a share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices (adjusted for dividends and splits). The predicted prices are mainly within the bounds of the share price uncertainty and lead by 3 months. Since the measured price volatility is much higher than the predicted one there are some large deviations from the predicted level. In any case, such fluctuations have always ended on the predicted curve. One can use this observation for a qualitative forecast of the future price movements.It should be noted that here we present a tentative model which is fresh and needs to be validated by new data (new CPI estimates will be published tomorrow).The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and January 2012 of $6.33.

321358,24491,2012-01-23T14:29:11-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $83 per share, which is slightly lower than where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more information on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. FedEx scores a respectable 7 on our scale (reflecting its fair value and bullish technicals).Our Report on FexEx imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsFedEx 's scores fairly well on our business quality matrix. The firm has put up solid economic returns for shareholders during the past few years with relatively low volatility in its operating results. Return oninvested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 13.4% during the past three years.The firm is trading at attractive valuation multiples relative to peers, but our DCF process indicates a less compelling opportunity. We'd wait for a clearer signal on valuation before jumping into the firm's shares.FedEx 's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.1% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'dexpect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a net income CAGR of about 8.9% during the past 3 years. We expect its net income growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital ROIC with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 13.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. FedEx 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differ-ences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At FedEx , cash flow from operations increased about 47% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expendituresexpanded about 40% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that FedEx 's shares are worth between $62.00 - $104.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $83 per share represents a price-toearnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.8%, which is above FedEx 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx , we use a 11.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $83 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx . We think the firm is attractive below $62 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $104 pershare (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx 's fair value at this point in time to be about $83 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assumingour long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. Theexpected fair value of $114 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $83 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The quarter’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 and year-ago earnings of 81 cents.The outperformance was attributable to strong yields, record holiday shipping and a remarkable performance by FedEx Ground. Adjusted earnings exclude 10 cents per share of special items related to the FedEx Express legal reserve reversal.Total revenue climbed 9% year-over-year to $10.56 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.63 billion.Operating income jumped 107% year-over-year to $813 million in the reported quarter. The year-over-year performance was credited to continued healthy performance by FedEx Ground and improved results at FedEx Freight. Operating margin also showed an increase of 360 basis points (bps) to 7.7% - from 4.1% in the year-ago quarter.Operating expenses rose 5.2% year-over-year to $9.75 billion, mainly due to a 17.5% rise in the fuel cost.Segment ResultsFedEx Express revenue was $6.54 billion in the reported quarter, up 8% year over year. Operating income shot up 96% year-over-year to $349 million, resulting in a 240 bps expansion in operating margin to 5.3%. FedEx benefited from the fuel surcharge timing lag and the reversal of a $66 million reserve associated with litigation.The FedEx International Priority (IP) average daily package volume dipped 1% year-over-year while revenue per package (yield) grew 5% on higher fuel surcharges and package weights. The U.S. domestic revenue per package rose 9% year-over-year despite a 4% decline in the U.S. domestic average daily package volume.FedEx Ground revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $2.48 billion attributable to package volume growth at FedEx Ground as well as FedEx SmartPost. Operating income spiked 43% year over year to $465 million, resulting in operating margin of 18.8% compared with 14.9% in the year-ago quarter.FedEx Ground average daily package volume increased 5% and revenue per package grew 8%. FedEx SmartPost average daily volume expanded 13% and revenue per package rose 5%.FedEx Freight revenue jumped 10% year-over-year to $1.23 billion, reflecting increases of 6% in LTL (less-than-truckload) yield and 2% in average daily LTL shipments. FedEx Freight recorded an operating loss of $1 million compared with $110 million in the year-ago quarter.Operating margin improved to (0.1%) from (9.8%) in the year-ago quarter. The strong performance was driven by operational efficiency from the combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL completed last year.FedEx Services revenue inched up 0.01% year-over-year to $401 million in the third quarter.LiquidityFedEx exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.04 billion compared with $2.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2011. Long-term debt dropped to $1.25 billion from $1.67 billion at the end of May 31, 2011.Looking AheadFedEx has projected earnings in the range of $1.75 to $2.00 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. The mid-point ($1.87) is lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98.Based on rising fuel prices and moderate economic growth, FedEx expects its fiscal 2012 earnings in the range of $6.35–$6.60 per share. The mid-point ($6.47) is above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.38. Including the FedEx Express legal reserve reversal, earnings are expected to be $6.43–$6.68 per share.FedEx continues to expect capital spending of $4.2 billion for fiscal 2012.Our TakeDespite moderate economic growth, we believe earnings and revenue will continue improving going forward on strong demand, better pricing, continued yield (revenue per package) improvement, industrial production growth and diminishing cost headwinds. Further, solid Express growth, market share gains at Ground and a profitable Freight business from network restructuring should lead to earnings improvement.However, increased investments, competitive threats from UPS (NYSE:UPS), the unionized workforce and steeper fuel prices could limit the upside potential of the stock.We are maintaining our long-term Neutral recommendation on FedEx.

Net income more than doubled to $521 million with earnings per share coming in at $1.65, far above the consensus estimate of $1.35Revenues rose 9% to $10.6 billion despite lower volumes as the ""weight"" mix of packages increased and FedEx successfully raised its fuel surcharge in order to combat higher oil prices. The company saw an increase in its fuel bill by 17.5% over the last quarter.FedEx ExpressThe express division, the backbone of the company, reported an 8% increase in revenue to $6.5 billion with operating income increasing 96% on the year to $349 million. Operating margins improved to 5.3% despite a 1% fall in international market volumes and declines of up to 4% domestic.

The cautious outlook for the final quarter is somewhat a disappointment and explains the why investors are disappointed.FedEx is worried about the recession in Europe and the impact of continuing increasing oil prices on its business. It expects to continue to see a decline in volume prompting it to cut capacity both domestic and internationally by parking some of its freight airlines already.TNT ExpressTNT is the last largest independent express company in Europe. After years of takeover rumors it seems that competitor UPS (UPS) is close to acquiring TNT Express after announcing a revised deal over the weekend.CEO and founder Fred Smith reiterated that FedEx does not have a strategic need for big acquisitions in Europe, pretty much ruling out FedEx involvement in a possible bidding war.Smith will continue to pursue expansion in Europe through organic growth. According to Transport Intelligence, FedEx holds a 12% market share in the next-day parcel delivery market vs. 35% for UPS after the acquisition of TNT Express.Some investors are disappointed with the decision to not make a counterbid for TNT Express as they point out that FedEx will have a strategic weak position in Europe for years to come.ValuationThe world's second largest transportation company is valued at $29 billion after today's decline.For the first 9 months of the book year of 2012 the company reported revenue of $31.7 billion implying a full year revenue of $42-$43 billion. The earnings guidance implies full year net income of around $2 billion which values the company at 14 times earnings and 0.7 times annual revenue. With mere $1.2 billion in long term debt and a cash balance of $2 billion, the company holds a net cash position of $800 million, giving it a lot of financial flexibility. Shareholders receive a quarterly dividend of $0.13, yielding 0.5% per year.Investment thesisShares have rallied an impressive 40% since the lows of October amidst the height of the European Sovereign Debt crisis. Over the last couple of years the company has improved its profitability with net margins expected to come close to 5% for 2012. Margins have improved due to fuel surcharges and a focus on profitability which has an adverse effect on the volumes already.Shares are valued fairly at 15 times earnings with downside risk due to higher oil prices and a continue volume decline amidst a European recession.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
315279,25144,2011-12-21T10:20:49-05:00,,"If you have not seen the video of a FedEx (NYSE:FDX) employee tossing a computer monitor over the fence of the customer who ordered it, you should have a look here. This video has gone viral so to speak all over the internet. Needless to say, this has been a bit of an egg on the face of FedEx. That being said, this slip (the intensity of which is still to be determined) should not impact the way that the stock is viewed. Why It Does Not MatterSure, a viral video showing an employee doing something so careless with a customer's package is never a good thing. This is particularly true since the company's truck bearing its logo is clearly visible in the background of the video. That being said, this video is not going to cause a long-term problem for the company. A quick apology is probably all that will be required by FedEx.For one thing, Fedex has around 222,000 full-time employees on its payroll. The fact that one employee did something so irresponsible is somewhat to be expected with numbers of that size. It is likely that the employee will be unemployed in the near future if he isn't already. Before you know it, the PR slip is behind FedEx and the company can move forward.Image Aware CompanyFedEx, like so many other companies is well aware of its image. It works to make sure that customers have a positive view of its service. Considering competition from UPS and the Postal Service, it is important that FedEx maintains a great relationship with its customers. In this business, image can matter almost as much as pricing. Word of mouth on which service is best can make a big difference in terms of which company is selected by the average individual.  In the latest 10-K for FedEx the company mentioned its reputation and the value of its brand as important factors to continued growth. Damage to that reputation is cited as a potential risk factor. There is little doubt then that the powers that be at FedEx will do whatever they can to maintain a strong corporate image for the company. Anyone who might consider avoiding the stock based on worries that this incident could bring down the stock should probably reconsider. Why Fedex Could Be A Big WinnerFedEx (FDX) could end up being a big winner for investors willing to look past these momentary news stories. It currently trades at $83.81 as of the close of trading on December 20, 2011. This is in comparison with expected earnings of $7.40 for next year and an expected per-year growth rate of 16.33% for the next five years. This is for a company that has a history of beating earnings estimates and a market cap north of $26 billion. If fair value is determined to be the earnings multiplied by the expected earnings growth each year, then it is easy to see why FDX could be ready to explode. These numbers are figuring in the expected 16.33% growth. This could be a little aggressive since these numbers are applying the 16.33% directly to the EPS, which is not likely. Some of that number will be eroded by increased costs and other factors. That being said, there is likely to be plenty of growth in EPS over the years. It also figures an increase in PE to 15, which can be difficult to find in this market, but it is still conservative in comparison with the growth in earnings. Some will disagree with these numbers and that is perfectly fine, but they show that the company does have plenty of potential. Even more conservative estimates by analysts put the target price for FDX at an average of $99.48 a share in the next 12 months. The high target is $115, so the scenario above is not entirely out of the question. Considering all of this, some odd news story today should not be a factor in determining if a purchase in FDX is a good idea or not.

The company cited strong holiday sales and continuing global economic growth as the primary drivers. On the conference call it said the company expects 2.2% U.S. GDP growth in 2012 and 2.9% global growth. This is based on strong expectations for growth in emerging markets. FedEx reaffirmed its full year guidance on “moderate” economic growth:The company's operating stats give us a decent look into the state of the global economy.

The report came as welcome news following a number of weak chipmaker earnings and warnings from DuPont (NYSE:DD) and Joy Global (NYSE:JOY) in past weeks. We are maintaining our $82 fair value estimate for FedEx. In the spirit of transparency, we make available our report on FedEx and other companies here.FedEx’s revenue advanced 10% from the same period a year ago, while operating income surged 66%. The firm’s operating margin expanded 3.5 percentage points, and net income advanced 76% from last year’s quarter. FedEx noted that it experienced particular strength from FedEx Ground, where revenue advanced 13%, and FedEx Freight and Express, where revenue increased 9% and 10%, respectively.The company’s FedEx SmartPost average daily volume increased a whopping 17% thanks primarily to growth in e-commerce.

After adjusted for one-time expenses in the year-ago period, earnings per share expanded over 35%, coming in at $1.57 per share, beating consensus estimates.Interestingly, FedEx hit on two themes that we’re focused on in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. The company noted that there was healthy growth in online shopping this holiday season, which bodes well for our payment-processor plays. FedEx pointed to the secular trend toward online purchases on its conference call and estimates that e-commerce now makes up 4.6% of total retail sales (from 4.3% in calendar year 2010 and less than 1% in 2009), suggesting a long runway of growth ahead.The firm also indicated that it will continue to modernize the company’s aircraft fleet, revealing continued strength for replacement aircraft. Specifically, FedEx said it would purchase 27 new 767-300F aircraft and replace its outdated MD-10 models, which it mentioned were more than 40 years old. A robust replacement cycle for new aircraft remains core to our thesis on the aerospace supply chain.Looking ahead, FedEx expects fiscal third quarter earnings to be between $1.25 and $1.45 per share, up from an adjusted $0.81 in the year-ago period, and fiscal 2012 earnings to come in between $6.25 to $6.75 per share (no change). The company anticipates that overall economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, but it did mention that inventory destocking has been a headwind, consistent with what we’ve been hearing from other companies recently. FedEx believes that the combination of low inventories in the distribution sector and continued demand growth will lead to restocking in coming months, a time frame that is more aggressive than ones given by other firms mentioning destocking in the supply chain. FedEx seemed optimistic on the call, and noted that consumer confidence hit the highest level since July, registering its biggest monthly gain since April of 2003.Here’s what management had to say about the economy on its conference call (view the transcript here):Our report on FedEx is here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The results are typically disseminated at 7:30 a.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Profits from FedEx are widely seen as a proxy for economic growth and tend to heavily influence the broader market gauges, including the equity index futures. Outliers and StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewFedEx shares are up close to 14% YTD, closely tracking its rival, UPS Corp. (NYSE:UPS). After a recent thrust higher, however, the shares failed to overtake the previous high near $97.50 back in mid-February. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD and 20-Day SMA have all flattened over the past week - signals that near-term momentum is waning in advance of the 3Q earnings release. Should results and guidance surprise to the upside, look for initial resistance at the aforementioned peak near $97.50, followed by the 52-week high of $98.19. Conversely, support is at the 50-day SMA near $92.00, with potential downside risk to $87.50. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com.)  SummaryFedEx shares are near a 52-week high in advance of the 3Q earnings release, following a solid report back in early February from rival UPS and the strengthening domestic economy. The company is also seeing solid growth overseas, but faces the risk of higher energy prices, geopolitical risks and recent evidence that the Chinese economy may be softening. The forward guidance will therefore be a key focal point for investors in light of the current uncertainty. Back in September, 2011, FedEx shares tumbled more than 8% after reducing its outlook - highlighting the importance of these critical measures.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis and or data in this report.

314095,25116,2011-12-15T10:41:12-05:00,,"In early December, the US Postal Service (OTCPK:USPS) announced the potential slowdown of First-Class Mail to a 2-3 day service as the fallout of closing approximately half of the service’s sorting facilities (see the USPS press release). The proposed move is a part of a larger reorganization to reduce costs by $20 billion by 2015. A first instinct is that the slowdown of the nation’s primary mail service will be a boon for other service providers, such as UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX).  The logic is that with First-Class Mail moving slower, mailers who want faster delivery will use the alternatives in the place of the USPS.  It is clear that volume will improve for UPS and FDX.  However, this view only scratches the surface for FDX.In truth, USPS and FDX are closely tied together.  A compilation by law firm Husch Blackwell points out that FDX is the largest contractor for the USPS.  Their information points out that FDX performed $1.373 billion of services to the USPS in the 12 months ended 30 Sept 2010.  This work generally relates to fast air delivery for Express, Priority, and First-Class mail.  These fees from USPS to FDX were approximately 3.5% of revenues for the FDX fiscal year ended 31 May 2011. This amount of work done by FDX on behalf of the USPS presents two problems to the shipper.  First, this will be lost revenue—and profit—to the company.  Second, the company has developed capacity to take on USPS mail.  This capacity is in the form of more aircraft, larger distribution centers, more trucks, and more staff to handle the mail volume. Should the USPS take on slower First-Class mail in-house, this could significantly reduce the FedEx volume and leave existing capacity unused.  However, the stagnant property, plant, and equipment is not without cost, and they will be a drain on FedEx.  In order to reverse this impact, FedEx will have to make up for the lost volume with new fast delivery parcels.FedEx has also contracted with the USPS to perform some of its delivery.  One of the fastest growing services for FedEx has been SmartPost delivery, a ground service.  In this offering, FedEx receives and transports the item to a USPS facility, which will provide final delivery of the item.  The service is high-volume and not time-sensitive.  The service is great for FedEx because it relieves the company of a significant volume of packages, and in turn let the company give more attention and resources to high-margin, high-priority services.   Should FedEx take on final delivery of more low-priority parcels, this could have an impact on the cost and the quality of service across the company. The USPS changes could be a great windfall for FedEx.  However, the implications are not yet clear.  USPS customers who want fast delivery could move huge volumes through the company.  On the other hand, FedEx could lose fees on a significant transport contract with the USPS.  Further, the SmartPost final delivery burden could be pushed back onto FedEx (like the existing Ground service). If FedEx is able, it could introduce a new SmartPost-like service to work with the USPS for faster delivery.  The ties between FedEx and the USPS are strong, and FDX is in a great position to capitalize on the USPS’ desire to provide exceptional service in a new low-cost environment.Expect commentary from FedEx management in the December 15 earnings call.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

FedEx (NYSE:FDX) sees itself as an indispensable part of the global supply chain in the 21st century, equally well able to serve Mom and Pop enterprises and mega corporations. Providing fast airfreight with new fuel-efficient planes, but not neglecting ground transportation for everything from truckloads to envelopes, all backed up by state-of-the-art ordering and tracking technology, FedEx has it covered wherever in the world its customers are.Increasingly, they’re in the Asia-Pacific region, and, as President and CEO Frederick W Smith points out, higher margin revenue from international operations is expected to outstrip US domestic revenue in the near future, for the first time in the company’s history. In fiscal year 2011 (the 12 months ending May 31) total revenues were almost $40 billion, a 13% increase on 2010. Net income was $1.5 billion or $4.57 per diluted share, up 23% on 2010. Anticipating yet more revenue and earnings growth in 2012, FedEx is poised to benefit from rising production of high-tech and high-value-added goods, an increase in global sourcing and selling driven by expanding e-commerce and the accelerating speed of the worldwide supply chain. Recent acquisitions in India and Mexico reinforce the two-pronged approach to expanding global business while increasing market share in the Americas.Forward risks include the uncertain pace of industrial production, reliance on global economic conditions, the impact on demand of higher fuel prices, and current legal challenges to the independent contractor status of the company’s ground transportation sector owner-operators. The FedEx Freight segment recorded an operating loss in 2011 as a result of a number of factors including a fiercely competitive market and severe weather conditions in the second half of the year. The company forecasts a return to profit for this sector in 2012.Major competitors of FedEx include United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), DHL International, GmbH (a German company owned by Deutsche Post), Holland’s TNT Express NV and government-operated postal services in the US and internationally.FedEx’s published first quarter fiscal 2012 statistics reveal that the CEO’s confidence in the company’s 2012 prospects were not misplaced. The first quarter 2012 ended on August 31 2011, and a comparison with the first quarter of fiscal 2011 shows total revenue of $10.5 billion, up by 11%, and net income of $464 million, up by 22%. The FedEx Freight segment continued the return to profit demonstrated in the final quarter of fiscal 2011, recording an operating profit of $42 million.During the first quarter 2012 earnings conference call, CEO Frederick W Smith commented on sluggish global economic growth and the actions the company had taken (such as reducing the number of airplanes in service) to manage this period of lower demand which was manifested particularly in international business. He remains confident that FedEx will improve earnings, margins and cash flows in fiscal 2012.Fedex’s stock price has been in a trading range between $65 and $100 for a couple of years as shown below:An income strategy with protection like a collar could be a good investment for Fedex. A collar can be entered by selling a call option against an existing or purchased stock and using some of the proceeds to purchase a put option for protection.Using PowerOptions tools, a collar was found for Fedex with a potential return of 2.4% and a maximum potential loss of 8.6%. The time frame for realizing the potential profit is 40 days. The specific call option to sell is the 2012 Jan 82.5 at $3.00 and the specific put to purchase is the 2012 Jan 72.5 at $1.12. If the price of Fedex’s stock is unchanged at expiration in January of 2012, the position will return 2.4%. As a bonus, if the price of Fedex’s stock is greater than or equal to the $82.5 strike price of the call option, the position will return 4.1% at expiration in January. A profit/loss graph for the position is shown below:With Fedex’s upcoming earnings date on December 15, 2011, an investor with this collar can take comfort in knowing the maximum potential loss is 8.6%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Should earnings disappoint, watch $80, a key near-term support level going back to August, followed by $77.50, just below the 50-Day SMA. Conversely, the $85-level is resistance, with plenty of room to run in the event of a positive earnings release. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com).Click to enlarge SummaryFedEx shares have been on a solid run over the past two months, climbing more than 25% off the October lows, thanks to a recent increase in ground shipping rates, evidence of a strong start to the holiday shopping period, a pick-up in volume for November, and the recent string of improved U.S. macroeconomic data. FedEx is also trading at a mere 11.34x forward earnings, a discount to the S&P 500 and below close rival UPS (NYSE:UPS) (15.1x). Against this positive backdrop, results below analyst estimates would be seen as a clear disappointment. In order for the shares to reach and overcome the $85 resistance barrier, a strong quarter and upbeat outlook for 3Q and beyond may be necessary.

The idea is to take advantage of the rising Implied Volatility (IV) before the earnings.

It should gradually increase as the earnings date is getting close, although I don’t expect a drastic jump. If the stock moves 4-5% before earnings, it should produce very nice gains. Reminder: if you take this trade, don’t forget to sell before earnings.The main idea behind this trade is “renting the strangle” before the earnings. An increase in IV should help to neutralize the negative theta and keep the floor under the strangle price. As we know, earnings are 50/50.

312664,24916,2011-12-08T11:20:58-05:00,,"In a previous article on Seeking Alpha, I wrote about the many benefits of using the 'reverse iron condor' option spread around a stock that is expected to report earnings with the options expiring that same week. By reading that article, it will give you a great view of how the trade is best used.Unlike a 'straddle' or 'strangle' option spread, which requires a significant price move to profit on the trade, the 'reverse iron condor' does not require such a large price move, as the break-even strike prices are much closer than the former. However, the maximum potential profit is limited, but so is your total risk. The 'reverse iron condor' is simply a great strategy to use if you prefer to know exactly where the stock needs to be at in order for you to profit.This trade is placed with a net debit and not a net credit.The 'reverse iron condor' has four (4) ""legs"" in the strategy. Here is how the trade is accurately placed (Note: I will use one contract on each ""leg"" for explanation purposes):Choosing your strike prices for this trade depends on what FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is trading at right before earnings, which is scheduled for December 15, 2011, before the market opens.Currently, FedEx is trading at $84.19/share. The 52-week range is $64.07 - $98.66.You can purchase this trade ahead of FedEx's earnings call, but you really want to get a handle on where the stock is trading before picking your strike prices. Since the expiration of the December options will come one day after FedEx reports earnings, there will be no issue of figuring out when to sell the winning side of the trade. Time value is not necessarily a component that is wanted when using a 'reverse iron condor' spread.Presuming all things remain equal and FedEX is trading around its current price, the strike prices for this trade should be executed in this manner (Note: I will be using 25 contracts for each ""leg"" of the trade):RequirementsCurrent Price: $84.19 Current Price: $84.19The current bid/ask spread on this specific trade is $1.51 -$1.70, so you should be able to put a limit order of $1.61 and get your order filled.The most you can lose on this trade is $4,025.00, which is also the net debit to place the trade. If FedEx drops to $80.00/share or lower, the maximum profit you can make is $2,225.00. If FedEx rises to $87.50/share or more, $2,225.00 is also the maximum profit that you can make. Even at $80.45/share, you will still make a profit on the trade. The break-even points are $80.89/share and $86.61/share.The bottom line is that if you are content with knowing your profit potential ahead of time before FedEX reports its earnings, this trade has many advantages. Also, the stock does not need to move as much as a 'straddle' or 'strangle would have to do to realize a profit. Yes, the upside is limited if FedEx should completely tank or soar after earnings, but there is also a very respectable profit either way.Disclosure: I bought a 'strangle' already with out-of-the-money contracts to limit risk on (FDX), and I may open up a 'reverse iron condor' spread before they report earnings next week."

299025,24491,2011-10-12T03:51:36-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies.In the case of FedEx (NYSE:FDX), we think the firm is worth north of $80 per share. We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy.This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. We think our methodology and broad coverage universe is largely responsible for the meaningful outperformance of the portfolio in our Best Ideas Newsletter.Our Report on FedEx[ images]Investment ConsiderationsFor every company in our coverage universe, we rate them on 13 unique measures. To get started, we show FedEx's below:Investment HighlightsEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital ((ROI0C) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. FedEx 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 11.2%, which is roughly in line with our estimate of its cost of capital of 11.2%. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisValuation AnalysisWe think Fedex is worth $82 per share, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 17.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.2%, which is above FedEx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For FedEx, our model uses a 11.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $82 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for FedEx. We think the firm is attractive below $62 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $103 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate FedEx's fair value at this point in time to be about $82 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of FedEx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence.This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $112 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $82 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

FedEx has been spending more on technology and fuel-efficient aircrafts to cut its costs. This is a very smart move considering the slow economic recovery, rising fuel prices, and the devastation in Japan. Fast growing e-commerce, fuel-efficient aircrafts, and an intensive marketing campaign are likely to push FedEx stock prices higher.FedEx Corporation is considering buying 50 Boeing's (NYSE:BA) 767 and Airbus's A330. The plan is an indication that the business is not slowing down. We can expect a faster recovery in the economy as more people use mail services. As of May 31, 2011, FedEx owned 614 aircrafts and leased 74 aircrafts with a maximum operational revenue payload of 824,640 pounds. 30 out of 688 aircrafts are not currently in operation and awaiting completion of modification. FedEx was also into purchase commitments to buy 53 more Boeings. In addition to $146 million in capital leases, FedEx leased aircrafts and related equipment and facilities as operating leases with an interest rate of 4.72%. We can add $6.323 million operating lease assets and liabilities back to the balance sheet. FedEx had $2.3 billion in cash and its equivalents on its balance sheet which is enough to meet its short-term obligation.I value FedEx at $88.50/share. The stock is currently trading at $76. I recommend buying the stock between $60 and $65 and selling between $88 and $90.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
276500,23567,2011-06-24T08:56:24-04:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) Wednesday reported very strong results for its quarter ended May 31, 2011. In our opinion this is a strongly positive data point auguring for solid 2Q corporate results in general and a sustained market rebound through the second half of the year.Since the beginning of May, the markets have taken a hit, first perhaps as a result of seasonality, then because of poor readings of economic indicators such as the leading ISM and lagging employment situation report only to be weighed down further by political sentiment in Greece. Since April 29, the S&P 500 (SPX) is down 5.6% but a number of leading ""high-quality"" companies, especially in the Energy and Materials space, are down substantially more.It seems the vast majority of strategists and economists have been calling for consensus forecasts to be revised down because consensus forecasts appear too high relative to recently weak economic indicators. We have been consistently arguing the opposite, noting that corporate guidance was more relevant and timely than the economic indicators since companies had plenty of time to incorporate the uncertainty into guidance. In addition, many U.S. based companies generate a large percentage of revenue and profits from overseas, so U.S.-based economic indicators do not capture the full story for corporate health. The weak data points from the economic indicator reports, and the sell-offs they inspired, are in our opinion to a large extent aftershocks from negative data that was already absorbed by the market back in March.We have also been noting that with revenue estimates still moving higher, it looks increasingly clear to us that the odds of companies further leveraging their operating assets (or net fixed costs) to expand ROIC is increasing. Further, with commodity costs declining, it increasingly appears likely that margins will expand in 2H11 as well. These trends will help drive market multiples and earnings estimates higher, which of course means higher levels in the market indices by year end (e.g., The Sky is Not Falling, Number of High Quality Stocks Augurs Well for 2011 SPX Price Targets).Today we got a very significant data point confirming our thesis from FedEx, a very economically sensitive company. In our opinion, it cannot be understated how extremely bullish this is for the overall stock market in general, especially from the current, beaten-down levels.On March 17, a day after the S&P 500 hit its YTD low of 1256.88, FedEx Corp. reported results for its February 28 quarter and provided updated guidance. Guidance called for FQ4 EPS of $1.66-$1.83, noting that ""earnings could be affected by the impact of the ongoing political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, and the potential near-term impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.A few days later, on March 19, 2011 FDX F4Q consensus estimates were $10,366m revenue, $891m EBIT and $1.73 EPS. Over the course of the next three months through June 21, 2011, consensus was essentially unchanged with revenue moving $7m higher and EBIT moving $4m lower and EPS staying unchanged.Wednesday Fedex beat the revenue forecast by $179m with EBIT light by $8m and EPS inline.(Click charts to expand)More importantly, ROIC by our measure improved to 9.6% versus 7.3% in the previous quarter and 8.1% last year, driven by the efficient management of working capital and fixed assets, its highest quarterly EBIT reported since May 2007, and its highest 12-month trailing EBIT since November 2008.To paraphrase the CFO's statement from the press release, FedEx Ground benefitted from increasing volume, yields and margins, while FedEx Freight returned to profitability. Even with higher planned capital spending in fiscal 2012, margins, cash flows and returns are expected to improve year over year.FedEx now projects F1Q12 EPS at $1.40-$1.60, and FY2012 EPS at $6.35-$6.85 per diluted share for fiscal 2012. We expect the F1Q12 EPS estimate to be revised up from the current $1.43 to the midpoint of guidance of $1.50, while FY2012 EPS estimate revision will bake in some additional caution, moving to $6.55 from the current $6.51.The likely cautious increases in analyst revisions for FedEx following its May 31 quarterly report will probably set the stage for substantial estimate beats by the company later in the year.We believe this augurs extremely positive for the majority of corporations, and we expect to see similar results and guidance actions across multiple companies for this upcoming quarter, setting the stage for a market rally from the current level.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The most important earnings report of the season is always FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and it's always one of the first to report. Today’s report is no exception. FedEx is currently an excellent barometer of the global economy and the picture for corporate profits.It reported Q4 and full year results with revenues jumping 13% in Q4 and 14% for the fiscal year. Fuel prices dinged its margins a bit in Q4. Overall, it sounded moderately upbeat:Guidance was positive, with FedEx now expecting substantial increases in 2012 EPS and capex:If we drill down into the 8k, we can see a nice snapshot of the global economy:[Click to enlarge]Domestic growth is very weak while international growth is generating enough growth to keep profits strong. FDX mentions that its package growth is led by Asia, so the Chinese recovery remains the linchpin in this entire equation. Obviously, Europe is weak and the domestic package data shows a very weak economy.Overall, it’s still a pretty terrible picture for the domestic US economy, but the profit story remains pretty much the same as it has the last few quarters. International growth is driving just enough demand that firms can report solid profits while slowly deploying capital into a moderate growth period. Margins remain high because companies have slashed payrolls and other expenses. Overall, it’s an environment where the domestic economy will continue to appear very weak and corporations with a strong international reach will continue to perform fairly well."
276652,24320,2011-06-26T14:25:53-04:00,,"Sometimes the journey is more enlightening than the destination, and the second-longest day of the year proved to be one of those.The stock market closed Wednesday about where pre-market futures had predicted it would open. The Dow dropped 80—not that big a deal, after a four-day relief rally unwound nearly half of June’s 673-point swoon.But how it got from point A to point B says much—nay, almost everything—about the opposite forces tugging on share prices.The morning was salvaged by a timely FedEx (NYSE:FDX) delivery, as the shipper trumped earnings estimates and issued a confidently sunny forecast.“FedEx is well positioned for strong earnings in 2012, given the positive momentum, moderate economic growth, and diminishing cost headwinds,” said CEO Frederick Smith. He spoke in the past tense about “a brief soft patch” and predicted stronger growth “going forward.”How high is FedEx flying? Annual earnings were up 23% year-over-year, and quarterly earnings rose 33%. From that sharply higher base, the company forecast an additional jump of 39% to 50% in the new fiscal year.The formula is simple: strong international growth, stagnant US volumes, higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges everywhere, and lower tax rates—partly because of the aggressive reinvestment of overseas earnings.In his brief opening remarks on the conference call, Smith stressed the focus on “high-value global customers” and “our global strategy,” and talked up acquisitions in India and Mexico as well as expansion into Colombia.As for the US, “productivity enhancements” is the name of the game. And executive incentive compensation tied to the soaring earnings will increase, of course, by enough to be mentioned as a headwind.After six weeks of lousy economic news, great earnings—even if primarily driven by overseas gains—provided welcome relief, boosting the stock almost 4% as 2 p.m. approached.But of course, as the afternoon dragged on, we heard in detail from the other Fed—and as much as Express impressed, the Reserve concerned.The central bank’s policy remained exactly the same, and though it sounded nowhere near as cheerful as FedEx, the Federal Reserve continued to forecast that the current slowdown will prove temporary.Unless it doesn’t, because for the first time Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged that the “soft patch” could, in part, reflect secular trends.To wit, the Fed’s collective forecast for GDP growth dipped from the neighborhood of 3.2% in April (and 3.6% in January) to the current 2.8%. The 2012 projection went from around 4% in January to 3.8% in April, and 3.5% as of now.Which doesn’t sound so bad, except that even in 2013, the Fed now collectively expects an unemployment rate above 7%. More than the numbers, it was the way Bernanke answered a question about the decline that must have spooked the few bulls in captivity.“We don’t have a precise read on why this, uh, slower pace of growth is persisting,” Bernanke said. “…Maybe some of the headwinds that have been concerning us, like weakness in the financial sector, problems in the housing sector, balance sheet and deleveraging issues, some of these headwinds may be stronger and more persistent than we thought.”So, to sum up, things aren’t going as well as the Fed once hoped, and it’s not entirely sure why, or how long this unfortunate state of affairs might persist. “Economic Trouble Puzzles Fed Chief, Too,” ran the AP headline.And so Fedex giveth and the Fed taketh away. One’s never been better, the other remains frustrated and disappointed.But these aren’t entirely unrelated phenomena. The FedEx strategy to invest overseas and seek “productivity enhancements” at home, easily understandable on the profit-seeking merits and replicated in boardroom after boardroom, just might have something to do with the 9% unemployment rate.Think about it: jobs cut in Memphis in 2009 are being resurrected in Mexico City and Mumbai.No wonder Washington is once again buzzing with talk of tax cuts, both on payrolls and the overseas earnings of companies like FedEx.The last time the latter stratagem was tried, the cash that came pouring in from overseas went mostly into dividends and share buybacks. It must also have encouraged the further diversion of profits overseas, in hopes that the experiment would be repeated. And now it looks like that time might be at hand.The moral of the story is that FedEx doesn’t need the Fed to be happy to do well. In fact, if the Fed is unhappy, FedEx might get a tax break. This no doubt seems excruciatingly fair to FedEx shareholders.A pained nation feels their gain.Disclosure: None"
278220,20568,2011-07-06T12:56:00-04:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX),  the world's second-largest package delivery company, reported fourth  quarter 2011 results on June 22. Both adjusted earnings and revenue  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates and improved from the year-ago  results.Third Quarter ReviewAdjusted earnings of $1.75 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by 3 cents and increased 32% from $1.33 earned in the year-ago  quarter. Despite rising fuel prices, FedEx reported strong earnings on  higher volumes, fuel surcharge and strong yields.Total revenue improved from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the  Zacks Consensus Estimate on improved ground and international express  shipments and strong yield initiatives. Strong exports from Asia drove  revenues in the FedEx Express segment. Package volume growth at FedEx  Ground as well as FedEx SmartPost spurred FedEx Ground revenues. FedEx  Freight revenue also increased, reflecting higher average daily  less-than-truckload (NYSEARCA:LTL) yields, but was partially dampened by lower  shipments.Operating expenses grew 11% year over year mainly due to high fuel expenses.FedEx projects earnings in the range of $1.40 to $1.60 per share for  the first quarter of 2012. The mid-point ($1.50) is a penny below the  current Zacks Consensus Estimate. FedEx expects its fiscal 2012 earnings  in the range of $6.35 to $6.85 per share. The mid-point ($6.60) is also  slightly below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63.Agreement of AnalystsThe overall trend noticed in the last 7 and 30 days suggests that the  analysts are inclined more toward the positive side in estimate  revisions for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year.For the first quarter, 10 out of 22 analysts made upward revisions in  the last 30 days and only one analyst moved the estimate up in the last 7  days. Opposite roads were taken by 3 and 1 analyst in the 30 and 7  days, respectively.For fiscal 2012, 14 and 1 analyst out of 22 revised their estimates  upward over the last 30 days and 7 days, respectively.  Four and one  analyst revised their estimates downward in the same time periods.The analysts believe FedEx’ earnings and revenue will continue to  improve this year on strong demand, improved pricing, moderate economic  growth, continued yield (revenue per package) improvement, industrial  production growth and diminishing cost headwinds.Industrial production, the main driver of the company’s volume growth,  is expected to be higher than the country’s GDP growth. Notably, Express  and Ground is also likely to see solid earnings momentum on the back of  a profitable Freight business.FedEx expects to invest $4.2 billion in fiscal 2012 compared with $3.4  billion in 2011. About 60% of the investments are allocated toward  growth projects, including the expansion of FedEx Express' Asian and  European networks, FedEx Ground's network, and replacement of vehicles  and equipment at FedEx Freight.In addition, the company continues to invest significantly in  fuel-efficient aircraft, including the Boeing 777s and Boeing 757s. The  investment will reduce transit time and lead to greater fuel and  operational efficiencies providing a competitive edge over its peers.  These investments will generate significant long-term savings, support  international business growth as well as drive higher earnings, margins  and returns. Further, FedEx is committed to its shareholders in the form of  dividends. FedEx’ long-term goals of 10.0% revenue growth per year, more  than 10.0% operating margin, cash flow improvement and higher returns  on invested capital affirm the analysts’ confidence on the stock.Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendThe magnitude of revision for the first quarter was reduced by a penny  to $1.51 over the last 7 days but raised by 8 cents over the last 30  days. The estimate represents a substantial growth of 25.98% annually.For fiscal 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $6.63, down by a penny  in the last 7 days but up 14 cents over the last 30 days. The Zacks  Consensus Estimate reflects a significant 35.40% gain year over year.Earning SurprisesWith respect to earnings surprises, the company’s fairly good track  record is expected to continue in the coming quarters. FedEx produced a  positive surprise of 1.74% in the fourth quarter followed by negative  surprises in the last three quarters (first, second and third). We  believe the positive momentum has started for the stock with the ongoing  yield initiatives, profitable Freight segment as well as improved  economy and demand.Neutral on FedExWe expect FedEx to generate strong revenues and earnings in fiscal 2012  on improved economy, strong yields, restructuring of the Freight  segment, industrial production growth, diversified product offerings,  diminishing cost headwinds, increased pricing and volumes across all  segments.However, increased investements, competitive threats from its close rival United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS), unionized workforce and steeper fuel price may limit the upside potential of the stock.Consequently, we are maintaining our long-term Neutral rating on FedEx. The stock retains a Zacks #3 (Hold) Rank."
276103,23374,2011-06-22T09:59:47-04:00,,"By David BermanFedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) is  often referred to as a bellwether stock, since the fortunes of the  package-delivery company tend to reflect the health of the global  economy. But this status might be called into doubt on Wednesday, when  the company's strong quarterly earnings failed to lift stock market  futures.FedEx reported earnings of $558-million or $1.75 a share in the  fiscal fourth quarter, up 33 per cent from last year -- and that's  despite rising crude oil prices, Japan's earthquake and tsunami and  ongoing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. Revenue rose 12  per cent, to $10.6-billion, topping analysts' estimates.At the same time, management forecast earnings for the current quarter  that were at the very top end of analysts' expectations. FedEx believes  that it will generate earnings between $1.40 a share and $1.60 a share.  According to Dow Jones, analysts had been expected earnings of $1.42.Investors appear to like the results, driving the shares up 2.4 per cent  in premarket activity. But as for shedding some positive light on the  health of the global economy, markets are a little less sure: With less  than an hour before markets open, futures for the S&P 500 were down 4  points or 0.3 per cent.Then again, investors might be more focussed on another Fed right now:  The U.S. Federal Reserve will deliver its latest monetary policy  statement at 12:30 p.m. While no one expects the central bank to raise  its key interest rate, there is a lot of concern about what the Fed will  say about the economy and its attempts to stimulate it through its  experimental bond-buying program.Disclosure: None"

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is  $1.72, representing a substantial 29.35% annual growth.FedEx saw negative surprises of 0.83%, 11.45% and 1.22% in the last  three quarters (first, second and third quarters, respectively).  Earnings growth in the fourth quarter will likely be restricted by  several cost headwinds such as higher compensation and benefits,  including retirement plans and medical costs, and continued higher  aircraft maintenance. However, these costs headwinds are expected to be  countered by continued growth in volumes and stronger yields.At its third quarter conference call, FedEx projected adjusted earnings  in the range of $1.66 to $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter. The  company also expects its fiscal 2011 earnings in the range of $4.83 to  $5.00 per share.Including FedEx Freight combination costs and the legal reserve,  management guided fiscal 2011 earnings between $4.49 and $4.66 per  share. Third Quarter FlashbackIn the third quarter, FedEx’s adjusted earnings missed the Zacks  Consensus Estimate by a penny but was a nickel above the year-ago  earnings. Lower shipping volume and increased costs were responsible for  the underperformance. Additionally, unusually severe winter storms  during the quarter disrupted the company’s operations.Total revenue improved from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the  Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by healthy demand and strong yield  initiatives. Strong exports from Asia and Europe drove revenues in the  FedEx Express segment.Package volume growth as well as FedEx SmartPost spurred FedEx Ground  revenues. Though partially offset by lower shipments, FedEx Freight  revenue increased reflecting higher average daily less-than-truckload (LTL) yields.Operating expenses increased 12% mainly on high fuel costs. Other  expenses such as resumption of certain 401(k) employee compensation  programs, higher pension and medical costs, increased aircraft  maintenance expenses, merit salary increases as well as costs associated  with the combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL  operations, effective January 2011, also added to the higher expense. Agreement of AnalystsEstimates for the fourth quarter have been trending downward over the  last 30 days. Out of 25 analysts, three have made downward revisions while  none moved in the opposite direction. Over the last seven days, only one  analyst revised the estimate upward while none made any downward  revision.For fiscal 2011, out of 25 analysts, three revised their estimates downward  over the last 30 days. Only one analyst made a positive revision to the  estimate over the last 30 days.The analysts have turned cautious due to surging fuel prices, the  ongoing political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and  uncertainty regarding the near-term impact of the earthquake and tsunami  in Japan on the company’s operational costs, shipping patterns and the  global economy. Further, the analysts expect higher compensation and  benefit expenses and increased aircraft maintenance costs to restrict  earnings in the fourth quarter.The analysts with positive revisions believe that FedEx is taking full  advantage of the global economic recovery by investing strategically in  key international growth markets, purchasing more efficient aircraft  (Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 freighters) and streamlining its network.The company has also undertaken several initiatives, such as continued  yield improvement as well as strong pricing, which are expected to fuel  earnings growth over the next several years. In addition, the  integration of the Freight segment will help it to return to  profitability in the upcoming quarter.Further, FedEx’ long-term goals of 10.0% revenue growth per year, more  than 10.0% operating margin, earnings per share in the range of  10.0-15.0% per year, improving cash flows, and increasing returns on  invested capital affirm the analysts’ confidence on the stock. Magnitude — Consensus Estimate TrendThe magnitude of revisions for the fourth quarter has been static at  $1.72 per share over the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate  reduced from $1.73 expected 30 days ago. However, fourth quarter  expectation is within the management’s guidance.For fiscal 2011, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $4.90, unchanged in  the last seven days but a penny below the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate for 2011 is within management’s guidance and reflects a  significant 30.35% gain year over year. Our AnalysisWe believe improvements in production growth, pricing and volumes as  well as strong yield across all revenue segments will facilitate FedEx  to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. Further, the  restructuring of the Freight segment, which is operating at a loss, will  bring its profitability back.Following stiff competition from its close rival United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS),  FedEx is boosting its international business through the enhancement of  existing routes as well as strategic acquisitions. Going forward,  robust economic growth in Asia, Latin America, China, India, Mexico and  Brazil will continue to remain a source of growth.Further, FedEx is committed to its shareholders in the form of  dividends. However, rising fuel prices risks related to the disaster in  Japan as well as cost headwinds will limit the upside potential of the  stock.Consequently, we are maintaining a long-term Neutral rating on FedEx.  The stock also retains a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term."

243720,20568,2010-12-27T11:51:52-05:00,,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), the world's second-largest package delivery company, reported second quarter 2011 results on December 16, 2010. FedEx earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. Though the company’s third quarter and fiscal year 2011 outlook is encouraging, they are below the Zacks Consensus Estimates.Second Quarter ReviewThe company’s adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share were below $1.10 in the year-ago quarter. Higher pension, higher aircraft maintenance expenses and the reinstatement of certain 401(k) employee compensation programs put a drag on the company’s operating performance during the reported quarter.Total revenue increased 12% year over year to $9.63 billion attributable to solid travel demand and healthy economy but was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.75 billion. The strong exports from Asia drove revenues in the FedEx Express segment.Package volume growth at FedEx Ground as well as FedEx SmartPost volume growth spurred FedEx Ground revenues. FedEx Freight revenue climbed 14% year over year, reflecting higher average daily less-than-truckload (LTL) shipments partially offset by lower yields.Company GuidanceFedEx projects earnings in the range of 95 cents to $1.15 per share for the third quarter of 2011. The mid-point of $1.05 per share is well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09.FedEx raised its fiscal 2011 earnings estimate to $5.00 to $5.30 per share from its previous outlook of $4.80 to $5.25 on expected strong demand and yield improvements in the second half of 2011. Nevertheless, the mid-point of $5.025 is also below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15.Agreement of AnalystsThe overall trend noticed in the last 7 days suggests that the analysts have regained their confidence, as they are more inclined toward the positive side in estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year.Over the last 7 days, out of 20 analysts covering the stock, 3 made upward revisions while 2 made downward revisions for the third quarter of 2011. For fiscal 2011, 3 analysts out of 23 revised their earnings estimates in both directions. For fiscal 2012, 7 analysts out of 23 revised their estimates on FedEx upward while none of them moved downward.In the second half of fiscal 2011, earnings growth at FedEx will likely be hampered by several cost headwinds such as increase in pension expense, higher volume-related aircraft maintenance expenses and resumption of certain 401(k) employee compensation programs. However, these costs headwinds are expected to fade off owing to the gradually improving global economic environment as well as stronger-than-expected consumer demand.The company is taking full advantage of the global economic recovery by investing strategically in key international growth markets, acquiring more efficient aircraft and streamlining its network. FedEx invests largely in aircraft and plans to increase its investment in fuel efficient Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 freighters, thereby raising its expenditure on aircraft.However, this investment will provide FedEx an edge over its competitors and will generate significant long-term savings, support international business growth as well as drive higher earnings, margins and returns.Further, FedEx’s long-term goals of 10.0% revenue growth per year, more than 10.0% operating margin, earnings per share in the range of 10.0–15.0% per year, improving cash flows, and increasing returns on invested capital affirmed it confidence. Magnitude – Consensus Estimate TrendOver the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was raised by a penny for the upcoming quarter and a dime for fourth quarter 2011. This shows management’s increased confidence in earnings growth during the second half.However, fiscal 2011 Zacks Consensus Estimate was reduced by one cent to $5.18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 was raised by 3 cents to $6.29.Earning SurprisesWith respect to earnings surprises, the company’s fairly good track record is expected to continue in the coming quarters. FedEx produced a negative average earnings surprise of 2.24% over the last four quarters, which suggests that it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that amount over the last year. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in both the reported and the first quarters.Neutral on FedExWe believe FedEx will benefit from moderate economic growth followed by volume growth and strong yield across all the revenue segments will facilitate FedEx to generate strong revenue and earnings upside. The combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations from January 30, 2011 will reduce operating costs and bring back FedEx Freight to profitability in fiscal 2012.Following stiff competition from its close rival United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), FedEx is boosting its international business through the enhancement of existing routes as well as strategic acquisitions.The company will acquire MultiPack, a Mexican domestic express package delivery company in the second quarter of calendar year 2011. FedEx Express also plans to acquire AFL Pvt. Ltd, a logistics, distribution and express business in India in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. These acquisitions will expand its network and enhance its capabilities in Mexico and India.Further, FedEx is committed to its shareholders in the form of dividends. However, reinstatement of employees’ compensation program, increased pension expense, aircraft maintenance expense, volatile fuel prices and competitive threats will dampen near-term earnings growth.Consequently, we are recommending a Neutral rating on FedEx supported by the Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Disclosure: No position"
258840,20568,2011-03-17T14:49:51-04:00,,"FedEx Corporation’s (NYSE:FDX) third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings slipped by a penny but was a nickel above the year-ago earnings. The company has guided fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 earnings above the Zacks Consensus Estimates.Third Quarter DetailsFedEx, the world's second-largest package delivery company, reported third quarter (ending February 28, 2011) adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, before the opening bell.Reduced shipping volume and increased costs led to lower-than-expected earnings. Additionally, unusually severe winter storms during the quarter disrupted the company’s operations.On a reported basis, net income dropped 3% year over year to $231 million on the resumption of certain 401(k) employee compensation programs, higher pension and medical costs, increased aircraft maintenance expenses, reinstatement of merit salary increases as well as cost associated with the combination of FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations.Total revenue climbed 11% year over year to $9.66 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.59 billion. Improved performance was attributable to strong demand for package-delivery services, given continued growth in global economy, as well as strong yield initiatives.Operating income declined 6% year over year to $393 million, resulting in operating margin of 4.1% compared with 4.8% in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased 12% year over year to $9.27 billion mainly due to high fuel cost, which exacerbated 30% from the year-ago quarter.Segment ResultsFedEx Express revenue was $6.05 billion, up 11% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by exports from Asia and Europe. Operating income deteriorated 33% year over year to $178 million with operating margin coming in at 2.9%, down from 4.9% in the year-ago quarter. The FedEx International Priority (NYSE:IP) average daily package volume expanded 5% year over year while revenue per package grew 7%.FedEx Ground revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.18 billion. The increase can be credited to package volume growth at FedEx Ground as well as FedEx SmartPost. Operating income improved 26% year over year to $325 million while operating margin expanded 140 bps year over year. FedEx Ground average daily package volume increased 6%, while yield grew 5% during the reported quarter. FedEx SmartPost volume climbed 17%, while yield grew 7%.FedEx Freight revenue increased 8% year over year to $1.12 billion, reflecting 11% higher LTL (less-than-truckload) yield partially offset by lower average daily LTL shipments (down 6%). The segment posted an operating loss of $110 million compared with operating income of $107 million in the year-ago quarter.Effective January 30, FedEx combined its FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations into a new unit “FedEx Freight.” This combination resulted in one-time cost of $43 million in the third quarter due to lease termination costs and severance expenses.GuidanceFedEx projects earnings in the range of $1.66 to $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. The mid-point of $1.75 per share is higher the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.68 per share. FedEx also expects its fiscal 2011 earnings in the range of $4.83 to $5.00 per share. The mid-point of $4.92 is also above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91.Including FedEx Freight combination costs and the legal reserve, earnings are expected to be $4.49 to $4.66 per share for 2011. FedEx continues to expect capital spending of $3.5 billion.Our AnalysisWe believe continued cost management, positive yield trends and the execution of the new FedEx Freight unit strategy will continue to boost revenue and margins in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012.On the flip side, FedEx’s primary competitor United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) poses a threat. The company’s earnings will be adversely affected by rising fuel prices due to the ongoing political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. The restructuring of the Freight segment will also pressure overall margins and earnings over the next several quarters. Also, the near-term impact of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami on operating costs remains unclear.Hence, we are currently maintaining our long-term Neutral rating on FedEx supported by the Zacks # 3 (Hold) Rank."
258597,24051,2011-03-16T13:18:08-04:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reports fiscal third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 17, before market open.  The whisper number is $0.85, three cents ahead of the analysts estimates.  FedEx has exceeded the whisper number in 26 of the 36 earnings reports for which we have data.Trading on an earnings event requires an understanding of post-earnings price movement, both after hours and intra-day.  We'll take a look at the average post-earnings price movement, when those moves occur, and if FedEx presents an earnings trade opportunity.Since FedEx reports earnings before market open, it's important to look at regular hours trading price movement following its earnings release. The average price move during next available intra-day trading (market open to market close) for the past four quarters is -0.8% ... obviously a very limited but negative price move.Longer term earnings analysis (last four years of earnings) shows the company tends to see (on average) positive price movement of -0.5% (intra-day) in one trading day following its earnings report, and -1.0% in five trading days.  Again, a limited (and negative) price move.FedEx has topped the whisper number in the past three out of four quarters, but it lacks a consistent price reaction.  Over the past four quarters, beat or miss expectations within five trading days following its  earnings reports, the average price move is -0.7%.Other factors that may influence post earnings price movement:The majority of investors polled are expecting the company to provide a positive outlook (by slim margin):FedEx earnings have historically given investors a positive surprise (by large margin) as they have exceeded investor expectations more times than missed:Summary: The whisper number is showing some investor confidence this quarter as it is three cents ahead of the analysts estimates.  The average price movement (either intra-day, long-term, or short-term analysis) is limited (negative) and inconsistent through five trading days. And while the company tends to top the whisper number, the price moves are still negative and limited. There is some confidence from investors for the next quarter's outlook.  The company would have to report well ahead of the whisper number for earnings to be considered positive and, based on expected outlook, provide strong future guidance for the stock to see a decent positive pop.  Data indicates that any post earnings trade would be high risk.  The negatives outweigh the positives, and data indicates FedEx does not present a viable short-term trading opportunity for most traders.When analyzing the data we collect, the most important aspects are how a company reacts to beating or missing the whisper number, the average post earnings price movement, and in what timeframe. Keep in mind that trading on whispers is a technical play on market psychology, rather than a bet on a company's fundamental strengths.A company's ""reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key; on average, companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report.Companies that exceed both the whisper number (from WhisperNumber.com) and the analysts estimate see a 2.5 times greater positive post earnings price move than companies that only exceed the analysts estimate but miss the whisper.The whisper number is derived from an average of individual investors, floor traders, investment advisors, and market strategists expectations regarding earnings for the most recent quarter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
242350,21369,2010-12-16T17:16:03-05:00,,"By David UraniFedEx (NYSE:FDX) had the market acting skittish on Wednesday before the bell when it reported its fiscal second quarter earnings that fell below consensus. But, now that the info has been digested, the situation doesn't look all that bad and in fact, the stock is trading in the green now. On the revenue side, sales of $9.63 billion were slightly below the $9.70 billion consensus, but not enough to be much of a worry. Revenue was still 12.1% higher year-over-year and 1.9% sequentially.The main source of concern comes from the $1.16 (non-GAAP) earnings per share result, which was below the $1.31 per share consensus. Total operating margin fell to 6.3% from 6.6% quarter to quarter due to various increases in costs. The main culprits were the reinstatement of some employee compensation programs that were halted during the recession, and a rise in fuel costs. There is also the issue of the Freight segment, which has been losing money for several quarters in a row as the trucking industry remains difficult. That segment is being restructured and incurring related costs.One of the reasons the stock was able to trade in the green is that looking into the sales trends, there isn't really any evidence of a global (or domestic, either) downshift in demand. Volumes were generally higher, both year over year and sequentially, across the Express and Ground shipping segments. International growth is outpacing domestic due to continuing strength in China (where else?). Perhaps there is some evidence of a modest slowing of growth leading to the near miss in sales versus consensus, but we are more inclined to attribute that to a slowing in the inventory re-building process rather than a decrease in overall business activity.Then there was management's guidance, which was raised to a range of $5.00 to $5.30 per share versus previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.25 per share. Within the guidance, management expects to continue to see decent sales growth while also reigning in some of the various cost increases. Additionally, the company is in the middle of restructuring its freight/trucking businesses, which should yield improvements to the bottom line. We also anticipate more price increases for its various services. (See conference call transcript here.)All in all, we would say the demand scenario still looks okay, with demand growth continuing steadily, with some reduction in inventory restocking. Some company actions led to a decrease in operating margin, but we see price increases and freight restructuring efforts helping for the quarters ahead. The main worry in our minds is fuel costs. That follows the broad input cost inflation trend we are seeing among all types of businesses. Otherwise, FedEx remains a solid, cutting-edge business.Note: FedEx also announced an agreement to acquire Servicios Nacionales Mupa, SA de CV (MultiPack) of Mexico. That follows the agreement last month to buy AFL Pvt. Ltd. And affiliate Unifreight India.Segment OperationsSales TrendsDisclosure: No position"

225976,23967,2010-09-20T03:45:09-04:00,,"Among the many secular macroeconomic trends over the past two decades, two of the most important have been a consistent rise in international trade and a growing shift towards E-Commerce. Consider some brief statistics.Prior to the ratification of NAFTA, in the year 1990, the United States total trade with the world (imports plus exports) was about $1.15 trillion or about 19.8% of the then $5.80 trillion GDP. The 2009 comparable figures were $3.52 trillion and $14.43 trillion. Nominal GDP rose at a 4.66% rate over this time period while total trade rose at a 5.74% rate, pushing its share of the economy to 24.37%. Trade has also increased throughout the rest of the world, driven by many factors including low cost country sourcing. Globalization has fundamentally altered how supply chains are viewed and managed, causing the complexity inherent in sourcing, purchasing, and distribution to rise substantially.A second trend that has become rather pronounced in the last decade has been the growth of consumer purchases over the internet. In the year 2000, Amazon.com posted revenues of $2.76 billion and Ebay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) revenue amounted to $431 million according to company SEC filings. Compare that to revenue figures for the year 2009: Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue was $24.51 billion and Ebay’s revenue was $8.73 billion. That means that for the previous decade revenue compounded at a combined 26.41% for both of these companies. Of course, neither Amazon nor Ebay (or for that matter any E-Commerce retailer) could exist without some means of fulfilling orders.Both globalization and changing consumer purchasing patterns have been welcome shifts to small parcel transportation providers, an industry in the United States that consists of just two companies: UPS (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX). How is it that the overnight and ground small parcel shipping markets have become so concentrated in just two companies? What are the similarities and differences between the business models of UPS and FedEx? What are the financial prospects for transportation providers and how well is that currently reflected in stock prices? It is to these questions that we now turn our attention.The Oligopoly: How We Got HereUPSUPS traces its origins to the American Messenger Company which was founded in Seattle in 1907 by Jim Casey and Claude Ryan. At the time, messengers had a poor reputation, often identified with saloons and brothels. Casey and Ryan hoped that an opportunity existed for a messenger company that was dependable and hired courteous and clean cut employees. The company grew by focusing on deliveries between retail stores and its customers, a niche larger delivery companies ignored at the time. It was in 1919 that the company renamed itself United Parcel Service. It also duplicated the Seattle business in other cities: Oakland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, San Diego, and Santa Barbara. Each of these businesses were essentially independent of each other, in other words the business was not designed to ship packages between Portland and Los Angeles, it was designed to ship goods within each of these cities. What the business did offer was a consistent approach and policies, a united approach to running operations that were separate – thus, United Parcel Service. Among the policies was a near obsession with appearance. This was necessary in order to convince department stores to allow the company to represent them in making deliveries to their customers. The famous brown that became synonymous with the company was chosen because it was easiest to keep clean.UPS continued its measured growth, successfully adding one city at a time. Among the milestones was the beginning of a New York City operation in 1930. The business model that was created, however, started to slowly lose relevance with the adoption of automobiles and suburban shopping malls following the Second World War. UPS' successful model started to broaden as a result, since it was already visiting department stores to pick up packages it became natural to begin delivering shipments from the department stores suppliers at the same time. Unlike customers, suppliers are not necessarily located in the same city as the department stores were. Over time, this led to an integration of the operations. By the late 1970s UPS’ domestic ground operations had become fully integrated. Although improvements have been made the current network continues to be managed in a similar way.International expansion began in 1975 with operations in Toronto. The following year, operations were started in West Germany. After initial struggles in West Germany, the company altered course and decided to expand through acquisition rather than building networks completely from scratch. Over time, these acquisitions were linked together so that the European network resembled the one set up in the United States. Cologne, Germany was chosen as the central hub. The breakthrough into Asia came in 1988 with the purchase of Hong Kong based Asian Courier Systems (ACS) which had operations in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.In response to the biggest threat UPS has faced, airplanes were purchased in 1981 and “Next Day Air” service was launched through the operation of four independent airlines. These operations were consolidated in 1988 through the formation of UPS Airlines. The volume from air and ground operations was consolidated for small package delivery to customers. This means that a UPS driver delivers both express and ground shipments within his route rather than employing separate drivers for each class of volume. The central US hub of operations is currently located in Louisville, KY much as Cologne, Germany is the central hub of European operations. The integrated air and ground network established in the United States was mirrored in Europe when air operations were started there.In recent years the company has aggressively expanded beyond package delivery by making a slew of acquisitions in the areas of logistics and freight. Expanding in this way meant both diversification from package delivery and at the same time owning assets that could spur small package volumes. Among the largest acquisition was Fritz Companies for $437 million in 2001. Its main business was freight forwarding, which is a company that does not own transportation assets, but rather purchases transportation space in bulk for carriers and then arranges for the best mode of transportation for its individual customers. Other acquisitions included customs brokerages, which coordinate the flow of information between suppliers, carriers, and customs agents in order to ensure a smooth clearing process. Among the largest of these were Trans-Border Customs Service and Border Brokerage Company. Asset based heavy air freight capabilities were added in 2004 with the purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding from Con-Way for $150 million in cash and $110 million in debt. The air freight business operations have subsequently been merged into the overnight small parcel operations. Less-than-Truckload freight capabilities were added in 2005 with the purchase of Overnite Transportation (now UPS Freight) for $1.225 billion. First International Bancorp was acquired in 2001 for $78 million in order to facilitate structured trade finance (it is now UPS Capital). Finally, it was also in 2001 that Mail Boxes, etc. (now The UPS Store) was purchased for $185 million in order to deepen relationships with small businesses.For the year 2009, 62% of revenue was generated by US domestic package operations, 21% by international package operations, and 17% by supply chain and freight operations.FedExFrederick Smith was born in Marks, Mississippi only a couple of months after Allied troops landed at Normandy Beach in France. The paper Smith wrote at Yale about overnight delivery service has achieved near mythical status, but it was Smith’s time in the Marine Corps that was most influential in the development of the ideas that launched Federal Express, as Smith noted the inefficiencies of the system and reflected on ways it could be improved. Smith’s father was a successful businessman (owning a restaurant chain and a bus company that was sold to Greyhound). Smith used the $4 million his father left him to start Federal Express, along with venture capital.Smith’s philosophy hinged upon a few ingenious insights. First, a huge market exists for overnight delivery for critical, time sensitive shipments. Second, the current industry approach of moving air packages through passenger flights could never be successful since it was hard to achieve economies of scale and on time performance could not be controlled. Third, rather than flying point to point, the most efficient structure was a hub and spoke network just as ground networks were organized. These ideas guided Federal Express, which commenced operations in April, 1973. The year 1977 was an important one, one that helped establish Federal Express as a solid franchise. First, a strike at UPS helped short term volumes. Secondly, and far more importantly, the aviation industry was de-regulated (the act was signed by Jimmy Carter the following year). The lifting of regulations allowed for a great deal of flexibility in terms of how flight schedules were constructed and the types of equipment that could be purchased. By 1983, the company surpassed $1 billion in revenue. In terms of start ups, Federal Express ranks as one of the most successful in history. In order to gain access to international markets acquisitions were made. The first of note was the purchase of Gelco Express International, a Minneapolis company with service to dozens of foreign markets. The purchase of Tiger International for $895 million at the end of 1988 was the most important, not only did it cement Federal Express’s leadership in the express market but brought with it a leadership role in Asian markets. The path from an international express company towards one offering a portfolio of transportation products came about through a single purchase: Caliber Systems, Inc. When Federal Express and Caliber merged a new entity was created called FedEx Corp. The company owned assets in four areas: ground transportation (through RPS, which is now FedEx Ground); Less-Than-Truckload Freight (through Viking Freight which is now FedEx Freight West); expedited freight (through Roberts Express now FedEx Custom Critical); and freight forwarding and logistics. The company was the creation of one of the largest unionized LTL carriers – Roadway Express.Roadway had a long history of prosperity and success navigating the regulated trucking landscape. Shortly after airlines were de-regulated, trucking was too. Carriers that had enjoyed decades of above average profitability found it difficult to adjust to the increased competition that came with de-regulated markets. Roadway was no exception. In facing up to new realities, the company altered strategic course and created a holding company called Roadway Services Inc. The national LTL carrier Roadway Express was initially the only subsidiary. After surveying the post de-regulation landscape, the first purchase was made in 1984 of Spartan Express. The national LTL business is based upon a hub and spoke model, a very efficient model for transporting goods over large distances; but one not very efficient for handling goods over shorter distances where point to point handling of freight minimizes both cost and transit time. (This difference is very similar to the differences in approach that Southwest Airlines took as compared with national airlines such as American and United.) A second acquisition, Nationwide Carriers, a specialized carrier in areas such as temperature controlled shipping and flatbed equipment; the final purchase made in 1984 was of a company called Roberts Express from Emery Air Freight, Roberts specialized in making same day deliveries by truck rather than air when it was economically justifiable to do so.The most ambitious project that Roadway Services committed itself to was Roadway Package Service (RPS) in 1985. The plan was to compete with United Parcel Service by having a lower cost structure through the extensive use of technology and independent contractors. After the required start up period of losses and investments the company was a huge success. One of the longest and most impactful strikes in the LTL industry began in April, 1994. The largest LTL carriers had proposed a contract that would have continued to carry above average wages for union members but also greater flexibility for corporations including part time workers during peak periods and the ability to use rail more extensively in moving freight. The union turned down the concessions and walked out on the morning of April 6, 1994. The crippling strike lasted 24 days. In response, Roadway Services Inc. decided to separate the company into two pieces in August, 1995 – one piece was the unionized long haul carrier Roadway Express and the other piece was the collection of assets that had been assembled since de-regulation, this piece was called Caliber Systems Inc. Although losses would shut down both Spartan Express and Nationwide Carrier, RPS, Viking, and Roberts formed a solid core.August, 1997 brought another strike, this one at UPS – it lasted 15 days. Prior to the start of the strike Federal Express and Caliber had already started discussing a merger. The strike caused the volume at both companies to increase by 15%, a portion of which stuck following the strike. The deal closed in January, 1998.The next large acquisition was announced in November, 2000 (and was closed the following year) for regional LTL carrier American Freightways for $1.2 billion. In time Viking became FedEx Freight West and American Freightways became FedEx Freight East. National LTL capability was added with the purchase of Watkins Motor Lines for $780 million in 2006, the company is now FedEx National LTL. The two remaining acquisitions of note were for the Kinko’s chain in 2004 (now FedEx Office) for $2.4 billion and for Parcel Direct also in 2004 (now FedEx SmartPost) for $120 million.For the fiscal year ended in May, domestic express was 33.7% of revenue, international express was 27.8%, ground was 21.2%, freight was 12.3%, and services was 5.1%.Philosophical and Strategic DifferencesUPS and FedEx clearly developed from distinct forces. In many ways UPS has historically operated as a partnership with the company’s managers being the partners. The company did not participate in an IPO until 1999, before that time the company was owned by current and former employees. UPS expanded methodically and consistently over decades, slowly adding operations in one place after another. It never made any major acquisitions until the most recent decade in order to build the supply chain and freight segment. The company has been unionized since around 1920 and UPS does not seem to view unions as a liability other companies would. In fact after the acquisition of Overnite, little was done to block the unionization of parts of the company. Finally, since UPS grew so methodically, it seeks to integrate operations as much as possible. As examples: both air and ground pickup and delivery operations are merged and after purchasing Menlo Worldwide Forwarding the operations were merged with the overnight business.FedEx has been built through the prescience and entrepreneurship of a single person, Frederick Smith and through the entrepreneurial spirit of Roadway Services. Whereas UPS has become comfortable with its union workforce (it admittedly took a long time), FedEx has a profoundly anti-union culture and its ground drivers continue to be independent contractors. Because of this, unlike UPS, FedEx does not typically operationally integrate its acquisitions. They have expressed their strategy as: “operate independently…compete collaboratively”.Market PositionsIt is difficult to get accurate market share numbers for all regions of the world. The largest reason for this is that although UPS and FedEx report revenue for all of their various segments and between the United States and the rest of the world, it does not break out its international revenues by country or even by region.Internationally, the small parcel market is no duopoly as it is in the United States. Many foreign markets are dominated by current and former postal services. For example, Purolator is the largest Canadian small parcel firm (it is 90% owned by Canada Post), while Europe’s largest participants include entities owned by postal services whose mail monopoly has ended. This includes Germany (DHL), the Netherlands (TNT), France (La Poste), and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail).Globally, four firms, UPS, FedEx, DHL, and TNT, dominate with a combined market share of around 70%. DHL and TNT have no direct United States presence, but in most other regions DHL has a larger presence than either UPS or FedEx.The market share figures presented below are very good estimates, but they are by no means perfect. Several sources were used to cull together the information, mostly Annual Reports and SEC filings of all four large players but also from information compiled by the firm SJ Consulting. The annual reports of DHL and TNT are far more valuable in presenting market information than either those of UPS and FedEx. Not all sources of revenue are covered, for example about 80% of UPS’ international revenue appears in the market figures and 20% does not. This is likely due to certain regions of the world being unaccounted for and an emphasis on export rather than domestic revenues. Domestic revenue is divided between ground and express, European revenue is divided between intra-Europe and export, and all other figures are solely for export revenues.Figures for the LTL and logistics markets are from SJ Consulting.US Small ParcelThe US small parcel industry is composed, virtually entirely, by UPS, FedEx, and the United States Postal Service (USPS). In the not too distant past, UPS had an extraordinary market share of around 80%. This has been slowly eroded by first, the introduction of overnight shipping and second, the launch of RPS and its successor FedEx Ground. It makes a great deal of sense for the other two international players (DHL and TNT) to build a United States network. Indeed, DHL has recently tried and failed. It takes a tremendous amount of capital and patience to successfully lauch a package network over an area as vast as the United States and since DHL could either not find a way to properly operate or did not have the patience to see its investment through, it is not likely that new threats would emerge to the current market structure. This will be further discussed later. On the other hand the current duopoly should not be too complacent about their home market, RPS’ success proves it can be done and the coexistence of more than two carriers internationally leads one to believe that the market could absorb additional competition.Europe Small ParcelThe European market structure owes itself to postal services that no longer hold monopolies on mail deliveries in their native countries. Just as it is extremely difficult for foreign companies to launch United States services, it is extremely difficult for American companies to do the same in Europe. FedEx tried and gave up, its business in Europe is limited to export business, with the small amount of intra-Europe revenue it has being from deliveries between European countries. It was no easier for UPS. West Germany was its first foray internationally along with Canada. Numerous cultural barriers had to be overcome followed by continued investment to slowly build the scale necessary to compete. Many within the company thought it was a mistake and that UPS should abandon Europe. It appears that the largest factor in the eventual success was the partner like nature of the company. At the time only current and former employees owned the outstanding stock. Had UPS been a publicly traded company as it is now and as FedEx and DHL are, it is not clear that Europe would not have been abandoned. As it slowly gained traction, UPS has set up an integrated air and ground network similar to that which exists in the United States.Asian Small ParcelAsia is an entirely different environment, if only because of geography. It is impossible to set up large integrated ground companies because many of the important markets are divided by oceans. The only way to successfully operate is to have a dedicated air fleet. For this reason, FedEx clearly is more comfortable than UPS operating in the region and they were also the first to make it a priority by sensing the huge inherit demand of Asia-Pacific shipping.  They are currently about twice as large as UPS in the region. DHL in Asia is roughly as large as FedEx and UPS combined, and thus has the strongest position. The figures below are for exports only and do not include shipping between Asian countries.Eastern  Europe, the Middle East, and Africa Small ParcelDHL clearly has the upper hand in this part of the world. It is likely to remain this way as competitors view other parts of the world as more strategic and worthy of the bulk of available investment funds.North and South America (except the United States) Small ParcelFedEx has the advantage here, and UPS and FedEx predictably dominate. It is likely that South America will increasingly become a battle ground if Brazil continues its recent economic performance.Consolidated Global Small ParcelThe above title is something of a misnomer since I have already confessed to the fact that the previous figures are not exhaustive. The available figures when added together are also extremely concentrated in the United States and Europe, while these are the two largest small parcel markets they are not as large relative to the rest of the world when export volume is all that is considered in many markets. Despite its limitations, the consolidated figures do provide a good measure of the global market and also accurately illustrate the dominance of UPS, FedEx, DHL, and TNT.I have also added a column that weights each market share by the regions contribution to world GDP. This approach has its limitations as well, but gives a greater weight to emerging regions where transportation has not yet reached the penetration relative to the overall economy that mature economies have. The weights used were based upon GDP figures from the CIA World Factbook and are 24.52% for the United States, 27.62% for Europe, 28.17% for Asia, 8.5% for Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and 11.18% for the Americas.North American Less-Than-Truckload (LTL)  FreightThe LTL market provides far less favorable economics than the small parcel market, primarily because of greater competition. FedEx seems to have viewed LTL more positively than UPS has. It also has two separate LTL networks: a regional network built from Viking in the west and American Freightways in the east and a national network from the acquisition of Watkins Motor Lines. It has recently announced the integration of those two networks. That will certainly present some challenges (more so than many have indicated) but will also instill greater discipline to the market.UPS entered the industry with its purchase of Overnite. Many of UPS’ past acquisitions have been made in part as a means to move more packages through its small parcel network (such as customs brokerage acquisitions and The UPS Store). Entry into the LTL market seems to be for the opposite reasons. Using LTL contacts to gain small parcel volume has not been as meaningful as using small parcel contacts to gain LTL market share. Technology, in which UPS and FedEx have massive advantages over other freight providers, has also been transferred to LTL.The industry overall appears to be more rational than it has historically been, despite weak industry conditions at present. It does not seem likely that much capacity will be added in aggregate any time soon. Indeed, the largest player YRC Worldwide has shed capacity in its network integration of Yellow and Roadway. And as already mentioned, FedEx is also shedding capacity. The industry will never have the profitability that small parcel shipping does, but once industry conditions are more normalized it is likely that plenty of profits will go around. The biggest threat to trucking is rails, particularly if fuel prices spike again. In all likelihood, carriers will continue to attempt to ship freight that is not time sensitive and over long distances through railroads. As I already mentioned, the market share data below comes from SJ Consulting, which is far and away the best source for industry data.LogisticsThis is an area in which UPS has a large presence and FedEx does not. Much like FedEx appears to be much more optimistic about the LTL industry, UPS appears to be much more optimistic about asset light transportation businesses. One of the selling points made by UPS is that it can be the entire supply chain, coordinating and tracking everything from supplier shipments to current inventory levels to final delivery to the customer. This is especially appealing to small businesses who have more to gain from UPS’ scale and technology than larger businesses would, but large corporations also hire UPS to oversee portions of their supply chain. In particular UPS has focused on three core areas: retail, technology, and health care.In addition to these, UPS logistics’ businesses include freight forwarding and customs brokerage. FedEx is also a player in those businesses, but they have so far limited themselves to asset light companies that have clear synergies with their asset based networks (such as customs brokerage).The below figures are global and are taken from figures compiled by SJ Consulting.RetailBoth UPS and FedEx have purchased retail presences in order to boost services to small businesses and create additional volume opportunities. UPS purchased Mail Boxes, etc. in 2001 for $185 million in cash. Sometime later, at the outset of 2004, FedEx closed its acquisition of Kinko’s which cost $2.2 billion in cash along with the assumption of about $200 million in debt. Both companies have been re-branded to The UPS Store and FedEx Office in the time since. It is also safe to say that each company had difficulties with these acquisitions. A package network has substantial fixed costs and as a result must secure a minimum level of volume to be profitable. As a result, a large proportion of volume for both UPS and FedEx are deeply discounted shipments originating with businesses. These discounts are not given in the retail market, because the volume per shipper is so small. As a result this retail volume carries attractive margins.The UPS Store inherited a franchise model from Mail Boxes, etc. This allowed for rapid expansion while maintaining below average capital requirements. But following UPS’ purchase it became clear that often the interests of the parent and subsidiary might often diverge. The goal in purchasing the company was clearly to secure a stable means of generating volume through the then 3,300 US franchises. The problem, though, was that UPS had an incentive to encourage volume growth through channels other than retail since it is more efficient to have a driver simply make a daily pick up than to insert a retail relationship between UPS and the customer. The relationship between UPS and franchisees has been acrimonious to say the least and the issues remain unresolved. Prior to UPS, Mail Boxes, etc. was owned by US Office Products Company, which is now bankrupt, but based upon its filings Mail Boxes, etc. had operating margins typically close to the mid to high teens and revenue was close to $85 million at the time UPS purchased the company. So UPS, by my estimate, paid around 22 times earnings for the company. Of course, as has already been laid out, it was for volume and not earnings that the company was purchased and thus the current poor relationship with the franchisees. Since there were 3,300 locations in the United States when UPS bought the company and that number remains the same today, it appears that expansion has not been a priority.Kinko’s was founded in 1970 and for a long time geared itself towards college students rather than business professionals or small business owners. The stores are not franchised, which means a higher net investment from FedEx, but control over corporate strategy without having to interact with franchise owners. A typical Kinko’s also has a more diverse revenue stream including printing services and office supplies. As a result, each location does substantially more revenue than a UPS Store would, but the store footprint is smaller. At the time of purchase there were about 1,300 US and Canadian Kinko’s locations and today there are 1,800. Based upon a $2.2 billion cash price, revenues of about $2 billion, and an operating margin of 7% FedEx paid about 24 times earnings for Kinko’s.The Future“It is best to read the weather forecast before praying for rain.” – Mark TwainPerhaps the most important question for both UPS and FedEx is whether or not the small parcel oligopoly in the United States continues. The simple answer is that it is very likely that it will. This does not make very good economic sense since over the course of an economic cycle the existing carriers earn substantially more than their cost of capital. Why is it that this has not and will not attract competition? Looking at the global market it would seem likely that both DHL and TNT would eventually make a move to capture a share of the United States market. Of course, DHL did enter the market and failed. Why? DHL’s experience is key to understanding the future of small parcel shipping in the United States.DHL had deep pockets to fund its move into the US market. It paid $1.05 billion for Airborne Express in 2003 and then invested, along with Airborne, a further $1.9 billion. To top it off was a $150 million marketing campaign. Shippers also had an incentive to see the market become competitive and were willing to give the start up the benefit of the doubt. Many states gave DHL some or all of their overnight business while companies like Dell and Skechers also shifted some of their shipments. Since capacity was tight between 2003 and 2007, UPS and FedEx did not initiate a price war with DHL either. In short, the timing was near perfect for a new entrant.The failure of DHL in this context can seem puzzling. The reality was that they put the cart before the horse by seeking to secure business while operations were not fully in place. If DHL had first worked through common operational challenges and then gradually brought on new business, they may still be in the United States. Once a reputation is gained for unreliability, though, it is very difficult to change, much like Hester Prynne's scarlet letter. Other challenges existed as well, such as the relationship with Airborne. Whatever your view of the lessons from DHL’s results are three facts seem undeniable: DHL was the most likely company to be the third US small parcel provider, the time selected by DHL was a good one with generally tight capacity, and DHL could not gain traction. In view of this it seems improbable, though not certain, that new competition will emerge anytime soon.That leads to the next logical question: If the market will be carved up between UPS and FedEx how will it be shared? First, it is important to revisit the two business models in the United States. UPS has integrated operations for both air and ground delivery (the line haul operations are necessarily independent) while FedEx has distinct air and ground networks. Pick-up and delivery drivers for FedEx are independent contractors, similar to franchise owners. They own their own trucks, pay for their own fuel, and are paid by the package. UPS drivers are unionized employees paid by the hour. It seems straightforward to me to say that the integrated model of UPS is intrinsically more efficient since so much of transportation efficiency is based upon density. At the same time, the FedEx model places more responsibility on the shoulders of drivers to be productive and ultimately a greater share of the profit pool accrues to the owners rather than to labor. I am not taking sides in the morality of either model or in any way implying that UPS drivers are not productive (the exact opposite is the truth). What I am doing is stating some straightforward truths based upon history. Many of the estimates I have seen place the direct costs of FedEx operating both networks as about 15% less per package than UPS operating one network. Based upon that it may be surprising to view the following data for US small parcel operating margins; UPS for its integrated network and FedEx for ground only.Why has UPS been more profitable? Because many of the costs incurred have been fixed or of a fixed like nature. These include technology and supervision, where more volume can absorb these costs. Here are the ground revenues for both companies over the same time frame.UPS should be concerned about the trends. If FedEx continues to make volume gains along with maintaining a direct cost advantage, they could in time seize dominance in the industry. There are other factors that are a concern for FedEx. These are mostly legal and political. On the legal front, many have challenged the independent contractor model in court, claiming that they legally should be classified as employees. Many of the issues have come in Massachusetts and California. If FedEx loses these battles it seems likely that unionization would follow. And so the future of the argument should correctly be placed in the context of labor’s role in the economy. If the power of unions persist at current levels, it seems unlikely that this model will be upended. On the other hand if the events of the past few years signify a long term pivot in the distribution of political power then there is a reasonable chance that serious challenges could mount, both in the laws preventing FedEx Express from unionizing and the model which prevents FedEx Ground from doing so.Regardless, the US market will continue to have plenty of volume to busy both carriers even as the nature of competitive advantage could shift dramatically.ValuationBecause of the cyclical nature of the underlying businesses I chose to value them using a sum of the parts analysis and assume that volume and margins return to the historical peak of 2007.First, here are the valuation assumptions for UPS which should hopefully be very straightforward.Here is the similar chart for FedEx. To put the above results into perspective, they assume that normalized earnings for UPS are $4.77 per share and a fair multiple is 15. Normalized earnings for FedEx are assumed to be about $6.68 and a fair multiple is also about 15. In the case of UPS, returns on investment are still greater but so are the gross amount of debt and pension liabilities.Your valuation model or estimates would likely be different than mine, but the valuations do not need to be complicated. FedEx is statistically cheaper, but I would challenge you to answer the following questions before making any valuation or investing decisions:1. What is the likelihood another entrant will enter the US small parcel market? 2. What role will labor have in political discourse ten years from now? 3. Will growth in emerging markets continue and what role will US multinationals play in that growth? 4. Do you think that there is some probability globalization could reverse itself?I have my own answers which are very low, too difficult to say, probably and a lot, and yes but it is not very high.To conclude, consider what John Maynard Keynes wrote after the first World War concerning the era of globalization he lived through in his book The Economic Consequences of the Peace published in 1920:It is likely that today's trends, whatever they may be, will survive through tomorrow. But since they may not a margin of safety is always demanded. No one is going to out smart the world with excel spreadsheets; to make intelligent investing decisions, one must intelligently handicap outcomes. Although we enjoy huge advantages over those living one hundred years ago one fact remains constant: the world is an uncertain place.Disclosure: The author owns shares of UPS (UPS) and has no interest in FedEx (FDX)."

But along with the good news in the rearview mirror came some cloud-cover up ahead, visible through the windshield, as reported on Bloomberg.com:Finally, on the numbers front, while the current quarter's earnings guidance was lowered, FDX did increase the range of earnings guidance for Fiscal '11, as noted by Morningstar's Keith Schoonmaker:So instead of being ""wowed"" by the doubling of year-over-year quarterly earnings and an elevated guidance range for fiscal '11, the market received the news quite negatively, not just for FDX's stock, but also in setting the overall negative tone of the day (so far).Why?FDX is often referred to as a 'bellwether' for the broader market due to two things:This may answer the ""why"" question above.Have a look at the graph below (source: ChartFacts.com) that shows the comparable price performance of FDX, the S&P and an ETF representing the broader Emerging Market countries.The start date on the chart was purposely chosen to be June 15, 2010, the day before FedEx reported a similar announcement to today's... strong rearview mirror, cloudy outlook ahead.Take note of the severe underperformance in the month that followed. But also take note of the rebound in FDX especially as the Emerging Markets started to rally. (Click to enlarge)Today's report showed that FDX's international business is quite strong.This is consistent with one of the underlying themes in the global outlook that drives my portfolio management decisions... growth, especially in emerging countries, is underway in many places around the globe. Several countries have already raised rates,and are likely to continue to, in an attempt to ""unbubble"" their economies and/or to prevent a bubble from developing. FDX's global footprint and multiple modes of package delivery appears to have positioned it well to take advantage of that emerging growth.As always, each investor will have to opine for his/herself as to the appropriateness of having FDX in the portfolio, and as the following price chart shows, the price action of this stock has not been one for those who can't stomach turbulence (of any kind). But it's worth a review of the current valuation and a reflection on what owning FDX represents. It's more than simply a 'delivery' play....it's also an emerging and emerged global market play.Some other things to ponder:Much to consider...and weigh....and assess relative to one's financial profile and risk tolerance, whether to buy, sell or hold. You'd never drive a car (nor get very far alive) by looking only in the rearview mirror....and when the traffic signs warn about possible traffic disruptions ahead, you must take note.But no matter what conclusion each investor comes to as to how to proceed with the stock going forward, one thing's for sure....FedEx delivered!Disclosure: Long SPY, EEM, and various stocks/etf's in US and global/emerging markets.

225614,22600,2010-09-16T13:53:31-04:00,,"There were many interesting takeaways from FedEx’s (NYSE:FDX) Q2 conference call this morning.  FedEx is an important barometer of global economic health as they serve as one of the few transports that truly reaches all segments of the global economy.  Their outlook for the economy can really be summed up by two different comments made on the call.  CEO Fred Smith told analysts:FedEx CFO Alan Graf told analysts:Cutting to the chase – FedEx issued weaker than expected guidance.  They’re clearly seeing strong demand in the international market, but the “recovery” is very uneven.  The inventory restocking phase and the end of government stimulus in the USA appears to be revealing some signs of underlying demand weakness.  This is forcing them to be proactive.  Their margin woes as expressed by their CFO are significant.  They are realizing that Wall Street’s estimates are ahead of the game.  Their response?  Cost cuts.  They’re firing an additional 5% of their workforce in an effort to generate $150MM-$200MM in savings.  They might not be expecting a double dip, but they’ll be prepared for one.In sum, the global economy isn’t collapsing, but companies are beginning to tighten their balance sheets up again as some risks appear on the horizon."

The quarter’s earnings were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, but above the year-ago earnings of 58 cents.Earnings jumped 107% year over year on strong growth in International Express shipment as well as higher volumes in FedEx Ground segment, partially offset by the resumption of certain 401(k) employee compensation programs, higher pension, higher aircraft maintenance expenses as well as operating loss at FedEx Freight.Total revenue climbed 18% year over year to $9.46 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The demand for package-delivery services is increasing due to recovery in the economy.Operating income shot up 99% year over year to $628 million, resulting in operating margin of 6.6% compared with 3.9% in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses was $8.8 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter.Segment ResultsFedEx Express revenue was $5.91 billion, up 20% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by exports from Latin America, Asia and the US. Operating income was $357 million in the reported quarter, showing a whopping growth of 243% from the year-ago quarter. FedEx International Priority (IP) average daily package volume expanded 19% year over year while revenue per package increased 4%.FedEx Ground revenue increased 13% year over year to $1.96 billion. The increase can be credited to package volume growth at FedEx Ground as well as FedEx SmartPost. Operating income increased 37% year over year to $287 million. FedEx Ground average daily package volume increased 7%, while yield grew 5% during the quarter. FedEx SmartPost volume increased 23%, while yield grew 6%.FedEx Freight revenue increased 28% year over year to $1.26 billion, reflecting higher average daily LTL (less-than-truckload) shipments, which were partially offset by lower yields. The segment posted an operating loss of $16 million compared with operating income of $2 million in the year-ago quarter. A 29% increase was recorded in LTL average daily shipments, while yield fell 3%.FedEx Services revenue dropped 8% year over year, due to lower copy revenues.OutlookFedEx projects earnings in the range of $1.15 to $1.35 per share for the second quarter of 2011. The mid-point of $1.25 per share is well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 per share. FedEx raised its fiscal 2011 earnings estimate to $4.80 to $5.25 per share from its previous outlook of $4.60 to $5.20. The mid-point of $5.02 is also below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.24.FedEx Freight to CombineFedEx plans to combine its FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL operations from January 30, 2011. This is expected to reduce operating costs as the company will cut 1,700 workers and close 100 facilities. The transaction will result in one-time charges of $150 to $200 million in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011.DividendFedEx is expected to pay a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents per share on common stock to stockholders of record as of September 10. The dividend is payable on October 1.Our AnalysisResumption of industrial production growth, improved volume growth, and strong yield initaitives across all the revenue segments will facilitate FedEx to generate strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In addition, the joining of FedEx’ two units -- Freight and National LTL operations will bring back FedEx Freight to its profitability in fiscal 2012. FedEx Freight is currently a headwind for the company. Hence, we are recommending our long-term Outperform rating on the stock.However, for the short term (3-6 months), we are maintaining our Hold rating, with the Zacks #3 Rank as reinstatement of employees’ compensation program and increased pension expense will dampen near-term earnings growth.Disclosure: No positions"
242283,22600,2010-12-16T15:33:55-05:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) provided an excellent glimpse of the macro economy Thursday when it reported earnings. All in all, the numbers were solid even though it came in shy of Wall Street’s expectations. FedEx reported 12% YoY revenue growth and strong average daily package growth. Although the package data has little to no utility as a leading indicator, it is one of the very best real-time indicators out there. The trends we’ve all been hearing about are apparent in the operating statistics at FedEx. In essence, the emerging market economy (with double digit growth) is leading the charge and domestic growth continues to lag in the low single digits:The company’s Chairman, Frederick Smith says the economy is improving: All in all this a pretty positive sign. What we essentially have is an uneven economic environment where the emerging world has more than recovered from the financial crisis and the developed world remains weak. In the USA a $1.3T budget deficit is supporting growth (we have not talked ourselves off the edge of the austerity cliff as I hoped we would not earlier this year) and the de-leveraging has slowed enough (to my surprise) to contribute to growth.Although I still believe we are in for below-trend growth due to US consumer weakness (balance sheet & debt headwinds, housing headwinds, jobs headwinds, etc) it’s clear that US corporations are generating enough revenue growth to sustain tepid balance sheet expansion and fairly strong earnings. The domestic weakness makes the US highly susceptible to any exogenous risk so it will be important to continue keeping a close eye on foreign economic data – particularly China. This all makes for a positive, yet difficult to navigate environment for equities."

Yet, maybe the effect on the stock wasn't even greater because there was less there than met the eye ...Mike O'Rourke, of BTIG, explains what really happened. Basically, FedEx is ramping up costs again, after kamikaze cost cutting during the recession.In reference to the broad economy, the FedEx news was a sheep in wolf's clothing. For a year we have talked about companies being lean and mean. As revenues have begun to return in the first half of 2010, the lean cost structure has helped margins and boosted profits.As the recovery progresses, companies will need to begin hiring again, increase capital expenditures and reinvest in their respective businesses. In short, they cannot plan for future growth using an organization that has been cut to the bone.FedEx management used the term “strong” 15 times during the conference call (see transcript here). The reduced guidance was not the result of a poor business outlook. Instead, it was the process of returning the business from the lean crisis mode. The lower guidance costs was caused by the following factors: maintenance to bring mothballed planes back online, increases in variable compensation for employees, restoration of half of the 401K match, and higher pension obligations due to the current low historic return rate of markets.Mike also notes the following from the company's call, regarding the $3 billion that the company managed to trim from expenses during the dark days:Disclosure: No positions"

195098,22282,2010-03-23T09:11:40-04:00,,"At the end of last week, Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) reported Q3 earnings. Rarely are  corporate earnings reviewed closely by currency strategists, but this  report seems to shed light on the global economic recovery.FedEx, like others in this space, typically do well in the beginning of  economic recoveries. Its quarterly profit more than doubled due to a  strong pick-up in Asian export volumes. The high profit-margin  ""International Priority"" business jumped almost 18%. The volume of daily  domestic packages was up a little more than 1%. This would seem to  confirm the relative strength of the Asian economies and the improved  trade flows.While the 1% growth in domestic volume points to a US economy lagging  behind Asia, there were other details of the FedEx report that are more  promising. First, it raised its capital spending plans by more than 10%  to $2.9 bln. This reportedly includes taking a Boeing aircraft out of  storage in the desert and returning it to service.Second, FedEx  indicated that it would reinstate some employee compensation schemes  that had been cut in response to the recession. The company said it  could effect Q4 earnings and earnings into 2011. It forecast 2010  earnings at $3.60-$3.80 a share compared with $3.45-$3.75 previously.UPS (NYSE:UPS) reported in early February and it too reported a strong performance in  its international division (see conference call transcript here). Domestic volumes were lagging.To be sure, this is not a recommendation on a particular stock or  industry. Rather the point is that these corp earnings are confirming  the macro-view of increased trade and the economic leadership in Asia.While core measures of inflation are falling in the major industrialized  countries, price pressures are rising in Asia. Malaysia and India have  already hiked rates. China has tweaked monetary conditions, but have  thus far stopped shy of an formal rate hike.Although domestic business is weaker, FedEx's news of increased capex  and compensation adjustment appears promising. In this context, it is  interesting to note that the market is generally expected a strong US  jobs report on April 2nd. The consensus is near 200k, with at least two  large investment houses forecasting 300k or better."

(NYSE:FDX) is a bellwether stock, a point that hits home whenever the global shipping company says anything that is out of line with our understanding of the global economy.On Wednesday, the company gave a forecast for its earnings during the current quarter that were at the low end of expectations, raising some concern that, well, maybe global economic growth will also be at the low end of expectations.We decided to take a look at FedEx over the past three years to see how its share price has navigated the good times, the financial crisis and recession, and the economic recovery. Is it an early mover?If the past three years are any indication, the answer is ""no"": The stock didn't anticipate any of the big market moves.However, the stock certainly seems to over-describe moves by the broader index. Both FedEx and the S&P 500 began to decline at around the same time, in 2007 (OK, FedEx led the index, but its initial decline was very modest); both bottomed out on the same day (March 9, 2009); both rebounded impressively until late-April; and both corrected until recently.What’s different about FedEx is the magnitude of its moves. While the S&P 500 fell 57% from 2007 to its low in 2009, FedEx shares fell nearly 71%. The S&P 500 then bounced nearly 80% from this 12-year low, but FedEx bounced a more impressive 179%. The recent correction sent the S&P 500 down nearly 14%, but it sent FedEx shares down about 20%."

This was, however, down from $1.23 per diluted share reported in the year-ago quarter. Earnings overall were negatively affected by the global recession. Revenue slumped 20% to $8.01 billion, and operating margin fell to 3.9% from 6.3%. Revenue at the company's overnight-air business fell 23%, with earnings down 70%. The company’s earnings remain plagued by the global recession. Though management forecasted a gradual turnaround in global economy, for the fiscal year it expects earnings to remain subdued, compared to the previous-year level. For the second quarter, management expects earnings in the range of 65-95 cents per share. As a cost containment measure, the company retrenched a significant number of workers last year and also slashed wages for many of its employees. FedEx expects to save about $3 billion by the end of fiscal 2010 in May from its cost-cutting initiatives since Jun 2008.Segment Results In its Express segment, U.S. package revenue fell 22% on lighter and less expensive packages and lower fuel fees. But the number of packages FedEx shipped domestically grew slightly. Management announced that it will increase rates by an average of 5.9% for U.S. domestic and U.S. export services early next year. FedEx witnessed a 2% fall in revenue in its Ground segment with average daily volume off 1%. FedEx Freight segment reported a 27% year-over-year decline in revenues, with operating income falling as much as 98% on an annual basis. Operating income decreased in the quarter due to the lower average daily LTL shipments and the competitive pricing environment, partially offset by cost-reduction actions. FedEx Services segment revenue for the quarter, which included the operations of FedEx Office and FedEx Global Supply Chain Services, was down 12% year over year, primarily due to declines in copy product revenues. With a gradual upturn in the retail, automotive and housing sectors, we expect the coming quarter will be better than the previous term with more packages being shipped, but will continue to lag behind prior years' gains."

One well known technician, Robin Griffiths of Cazenove Capital was interviewed on CNBC on Monday, and he discussed some bearish findings from the charts of such economic bellwethers as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP). In the case of FedEx, it is often regarded as a proxy for the strength of the US economy because shipping activity often mirrors general economic activity. His CNBC interview was light on details of why he sees trouble in the chart other than the fact that FedEx management has acknowledged the distinct possibility of a double-dip. He argues that they would be among the first to know about this and confirm any such evidence.While Griffiths bases this bearish outlook on Fedex because of technical factors as well as management’s own outlook and comments, we actually draw a similar conclusion but through a different process. There is no doubt that has been on one heck of a run as the US economy has rebounded, and the stock has advanced 131% over the last twelve months. The fundamentals have improved over this time, but we are not sure that the earnings growth or sales have been revived enough to warrant such a run. So, accordingly we have downgraded FedEx as of this week to Overvalued based on valuation concerns.We did an analysis on how the market has historically valued FDX based on a given level of revenue and cash earnings per share. The price-to-sales analysis showed that FDX is currently trading at .83x, which is within the normal range even though sales are expected to fall more than 5% in fiscal 2010. However, our analysis of price-to-cash earnings yields a different picture. Over the past ten years (with the most recent years weighed more heavily) the market has paid 8.3x to 14.6x cash earnings per share, but the current price-to-cash earnings stands at 15.7x. According to our analysis, if FDX were to trade in the middle of its historically normal price-to-sales and price-to-cash earnings ranges, based on current fundamentals, the price would be in the mid-$70’s.We cannot deny that the fundamentals are improving and analysts are upping estimates for this year and the next, but based on our way of looking at stocks it has simply become overheated. Griffiths warns that FedEx may be signaling to investors that a double-dip could be coming, and urges them to stay away. Investors should always be looking for stocks that are priced attractively no matter if you are technically minded or lean towards fundamentals. Based on our research, investors would be much better served looking at FedEx competitor United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS), which operates in a similar manner to FedEx and has seen business pick up and yet has not seen their stock appreciate nearly as much.Original post"

At the same time spot oil prices seem to be down (at least for long enough for the headlines to intersect) Earnings will be released on Sep 17, 2009 but they feel justified in letting the world know today that Q2 EPS will be $0.58 @ share. This is way down from last year; but much better than previously expected.But look at the range for Q2 $0.65 to $0.95. The quarter in question is the next ninety days and management wants 50% wiggle room. The problem with guidance being changed six days before results are released is that there really is insufficient information for a complete decision. Investors are now shooting in the dark and hoping for the best."

This was well below consensus of $ 0.46 per share and our estimate of $0.44 per share, as revenues were much weaker than expected. Revenues declined 14% year over year to $8.14 billion from $9.44 billion, and compare to consensus of $8.65 billion and our estimate of $$8.87 billion. This shortfall largely reflected lower shipment volumes, a tougher pricing environment, and lower fuel surcharges at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight, where revenues dropped 18% and 21%, respectively.Positively, operating expenses also declined 10% year over year, reflecting cost-control measures FDX instituted previously, which were expected to shave $1 billion in costs in fiscal 2009 (including $200 million in the 2nd half) and an additional $600 million in fiscal 2010. These cuts will be supplemented by additional cost-cutting measures announced today, including; (1) network capacity reductions at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight; (2) staff and hour cuts; (3) compensation reductions at non-US locations where permitted; (4) streamlining IT and other internal processes; and (5) reductions in other spending categories. These actions will be accompanied by a fiscal 4th quarter (May 31) charge of $100 million, and should reduce expenses by roughly $1.0 billion in 2010.Looking forward, FDX expects fiscal 4th quarter diluted EPS of $0.40-0.70, excluding any one-time charges, down from $1.45 earned in the year-ago quarter. While the company is gaining market share in all transportation segments, this is not sufficient to offset the impact of the current global economic slowdown on its operations, which has been more severe than expected.We are reviewing our estimates and Hold recommendation on FDX. The current Zacks rank for FDX is 4 (Sell), indicating near-term selling pressure on the stock. In early morning trading, FDX shares are up over 5% from yesterday’s closing price of $43.05."
144167,20302,2009-06-19T06:33:44-04:00,,"While FedEx was widely reported on Wednesday to have beaten estimates for the fourth quarter, I think this interpretation is misguided. While the Q4 EPS of $0.64 was indeed higher than the consensus estimate of $0.63, what stands out to me is that revenues declined by 20% overall, which is a far greater drop than expected.  Three weeks ago I wrote about FedEx’s Required Business Performance and noted that its stock price of $53/share implied that revenue would decline by only 2.4% in the foreseeable future. With the fourth quarter’s results now in, it is apparent that things will need to get much better quickly for the company to catch up.  If it fails to catch up, which is probable, the stock will likely fall noticeably. After the release on Wednesday the stock promptly dropped to under $50/share, only to rebound today. This price is too high, particularly now that the bar set much higher due to last quarter’s miserable results. Expect FedEx to underperform in the upcoming year barring a surprise boost in revenues.  We could have seen this coming. At the time of my posting, FedEx’s RBP Probability was merely 62%, noticeably lower than industry and sector peers. With the news of unexpectedly low revenue but no commensurate drop in stock price, this RBP Probability is now even lower.   It is important to understand, though, that things look bleak for FedEx stock not because revenues are poised to decline, but because the current price of the stock is simply too high given the most likely scenario for business performance."

First, we are going to get our first test of data that could disappoint, which would spell trouble for an overbought market. But, just as important, we need to watch the industrials because there is going to be no sustainable recovery unless these cyclical companies are leading the way.  If the recent awful earnings report from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) is any indication, this sector is still in a world of hurt.  The Globe & Mail has a good take on how this is shaping up.In short, this market has risen to seriously overbought levels that has priced in imminent recovery.  But, the FedEx news should give you pause in regards to an imminent recovery. Even a delay in recovery until the fourth or first quarter would be a huge disappointment in this market.  Continued recession beyond that time would be catastrophic."

This was above consensus diluted EPS of $0.51 and our estimate of $0.63.Revenues dropped 20% to $7.9 billion from $9.9 billion a year ago, largely due to very weak performances at FedEx Express, where revenues declined 25% to $4.8 billion from $6.4 billion, and at FedEx Freight, where revenues fell 28% to $948 million from $1.3 billion, reflecting reduced shipment volumes, weak pricing due to increased competition, and lower fuel surcharge revenue from a weak global economy.FedEx Express experienced a 20% year-over-year decline in average daily freight pounds and a 12% decease in average revenue per freight pound. At FedEx Freight, less-than-truck-load (LTL) shipments per day slumped 17%, while revenue per hundredweight decreased 11%.FedEx Ground held up surprisingly well, as revenues only declined 1% to $1.7 billion from $1.2 billion. Daily package volume was flat while yield fell only 1% due to lower fuel surcharges.FedEx Services revenue dropped 13% year over year, largely due to a decline in copying revenues.The company’s outlook for the first two quarters of its 2010 fiscal year remains grim, with FDX citing the decline in manufacturing activity and the recent rise in fuel costs as significant contributors. Specifically, FDX estimates first quarter earnings of $0.30-0.45 per diluted share, down 76-63% from the $1.23 posted a year ago. This compares to consensus of $0.68 per share.In morning trading, FDX shares are down over 2% from yesterday’s closing price of $51.42. We have a Hold recommendation on FDX, and note that the current Zacks rank is 4, indicating near-term selling pressure on the stock.Our FDX estimates are under review."
143821,21435,2009-06-17T16:35:02-04:00,,"FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) has struggled with a sagging economy as earnings are down 56% from last year. However, the company easily cleared the low bar that Wall Street analysts had set for the company. Fiscal fourth quarter earnings were $.64 versus consensus estimates of $.51. Revenues dropped 20% from a year ago to $7.9 billion, dragged down by declines in FedEx Express and FedEx Freight division. Surprisingly, FedEx Ground was one of the bright spots as revenue only declined 1%.The company’s CEO Fred Smith, a respected economist in his own right, said for the second straight quarter that the company has seen the bottom. Yet his attempted optimism was overcome by the grim outlook the company issued for the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. FedEx is expecting to earn between $.30 and $.45 in the next quarter, which is well below the street’s forecast of $.68.Clearly, this gloomier outlook is a cautionary signal to the rest of the economy, as FedEx’s revenue is driven by sales of other company’s products. If FedEx is correct in their assessments the recovery might not be as quick as many had hoped or expected. Based on the historical valuation ranges FedEx is Undervalued and could trade in the mid-$60’s given what the market has traditionally been willing to pay for FedEx’s sales and earnings. Even though the next few quarters are admittedly going to be rough for the company at some point in the future FedEx will attract the interest of value hunters. The company will continue to be the standard in shipping and once an economic recovery begins then FedEx’s revenue will perk up with it. But as our readers can attest, we are skeptical that the recovery will be hear in the next few months. So, if you are interested in FedEx perhaps wait for the price to dip even further and then it will be a good stock to buy and hang onto for a while."
140504,20302,2009-05-31T07:48:34-04:00,,"FedEx (NYSE:FDX) has been the topic of a lot of analyst talk lately, understandable as the company tends to forebode economic troubles of the macroeconomy. Concerns abound about how much freight volume at FedEx will decline, and when it will begin to grow again. This makes the company strong candidate for a Required Business Performance (RBP) analysis. While most analysts will conjecture as to when and at what level volume will increase, making a recommendation accordingly, I think a better approach to uncertainty like this is to ask what the current stock price tells us about FedEx’s future.At $53/share, what performance must the company produce lest the stock be overvalued?  After performing a reverse discounted cash flow analysis, we see that the current price of FedEx stock implies that revenue will decline by 2.4% in the upcoming twelve months. (See FedEx’s RBP Snapshot) Breaking this down by components, a revenue decline of this size implies that FedEx Express International Priority – the company’s largest business segment by revenue – will see average daily package volume decline from 791,000 (over the twelve months ended in February) to 772,000. FedEx ground, the company’s second largest segment, must see average daily package volume of 3,325,000 in order to support the company’s current stock price.  To put this in perspective, international average daily volume was 813,000 for the year ended May 2008, up nearly 31% from the FY 2007. (And 2007 average daily volume was up 21.3% over 2006). So despite the seemingly tame decline of only 2.7% from 2008 to 2009, for a fast growing segment within FedEx this is quite substantial and is indicative of the economic struggles throughout the world economy. The question now is whether volume will continue to decline at the same rate that it has over the past year or whether it will plateau or even start to grow. Is a price that implies negative growth for a segment that has seen extraordinary positive growth over recent years unjustifiably low? Has the market overreacted to concerns for global shipping volume?  Of course there are caveats to this analysis due to unpredictable near-term nature of FedEx’s cost structure. If drivers and package handlers unionize, a proposition that now seems much more likely, revenues will need to be somewhat higher to offset presumably higher wages. Nevertheless, on an all-else-equal basis, it is enlightening to know that the company will need to ship 772,000 international priority packages a day over the next year to justify a current stock price of $53."
114192,21568,2009-01-11T07:54:13-05:00,,"By Ucilia WangFor a while, T. Boone Pickens stood out as a business tycoon who made his fortune on oil but became a true believer in using less of it and more natural gas (and wind energy). He won over many politicians and environmental activists as fans and faced few public challenges.Not anymore.As the new administration takes power and intends to pass all sorts of policies on renewable power generation and energy-efficient transportation, more business hot shots are making their views known. And they don’t think much of Pickens’ plan. FedEx’s (NYSE:FDX) CEO Fred Smith is one of them. Smith thinks using natural gas is not much better than using oil, and has embraced hybrid diesel-electric technology instead, noted the Wall Street Journal’s Environmental Capital blog Friday. FedEx has 80,000 hybrid diesel-electric trucks, the largest fleet in the country.FedEx’s director of sustainability, Mitch Jackson, penned a blog post last Sunday where he argued that substituting one non-renewable fuel source with another isn’t the answer. Rather, the country should invest in cars powered partly or wholly by electricity generated from cleaner sources (i.e., solar and wind). Jackson also argued that although diesel is made from crude oil, it burns more efficiently than natural gas. Jackson wrote:Pickens didn’t take the criticism lightly and took to his blog to defend his position. Pickens said Jackson needed to “do more homework” before making his argument against natural gas. Pickens added that diesel fuel isn’t as attractive as Jackson has portrayed it to be: Europe has taken to diesel-powered passenger cars while the United States has relegated diesel largely to large trucks. U.S. politicians have been gung ho about using ethanol to replace oil, but their plan hasn’t worked out so well. Corn ethanol has been vilified, and companies that want to make ethanol from non-food sources, such as switchgrass and algae, have yet to make it in commercial quantities.President-elect Barack Obama is keen on promoting fuel-efficient cars. But who will he listen to: Pickens or Smith? Or both?"

We saw this pattern emerge when we looked at the historical P/E of the S&P 500. We also saw examples of companies trading at their historic P/E lows here and here. But strangely, some companies actually see their P/E's increase during economic downturns, and not only those which sell cheap or defensive products. Consider Fedex (NYSE:FDX).Fedex is often considered a bellweather for the economy, as when the economy is going well/poorly, Fedex will often see a pickup/dropoff in deliveries. As such, when the economy tanks, one may expect the P/E of FDX to deflate. But here's a look at what happened to FDX's P/E during the last comparable recession:So what's going on here? The price component of the P/E value did drop to $40 in 1990 from $64 in 1987, but the earnings dropped even more. When this occurs, the P/E may look extremely large, but the company may still be cheap: Just three years later, FDX rose through $76.For this reason (and many others, which we discussed here), investors should use average earnings when trying to determine a company's P/E, since earnings of one particular year (particularly a recessionary year such as this one) can be misleading.Disclosure: None"

But it does point to the possibility that this recession will indeed be different, and that it might mark the beginning of the end of sticky wages.There's been a huge shift in power in recent years from labor to capital: Corporate profits have been rising much faster than wages for some time now. It makes sense that capital would make use of its newfound power to reduce labor costs in a deflationary environment of rising unemployment. During the boom, companies laid off workers because those workers demanded, and cost, too much money. Now that workers have lost their negotiating leverage, we might start seeing more across-the-board pay cuts."

By this I mean they point to fuel costs, weather conditions and underlying economic conditions to explain results. There is almost no discussion of competition or the relative merits of offerings.

Even if you take the headline data at face value (which you never should), you have to acknowledge the many changes in how the BLS models are constructed over the years. It becomes an apples to oranges comparison. Perhaps the fault lies not within ourselves, but within our data.Maybe we should be asking different questions of our financial media instead:  ""Is our press economically ignorant? What level of statistical naiveté is tolerable in the mass media? When did our financial media become mere stenographers? What happened to critical thought, analytical rigor or investigative journalism? Wasn't the charge of the press at one time to ""afflict the comfortable?"" To be blunt, any scribe that trots out the headline data on Unemployment or Inflation as gospel are either fools or liars.Of course, one possibility is that Americans are ungrateful, we are morons, we are too dumb to understand how good we have it. The other option is that the official models,  like any mathematical depiction of reality, are flawed. It's not that they are worthless, it's that they are not a precise or accurate depiction of the real world.Here are a few clues for the naive, who do not seem to understand why Americans are so unhappy with the state of the world's affairs:• Prices have far outstripped wage and income growth, leading to the first major decrease in the standard of living in the US in the modern era.• It's more than food and energy prices -- medical care and education costs have gone up 10-15% per year, local municipal and property taxes are rapidly rising, and yes, even free-falling housing remains considerably higher relative to median income.• The US savings rate flipped into negative territory for the first time since the Great Depression. That doesn't mean we are going to go into a depression -- but it's no reason to be cheerful.• Curiously, this article on sentiment failed to mention either of the words ""Iraq"" or ""War."" How, in a discussion on psychology, can there be no mention of War fatigue? There is a weariness related to the ongoing costs and casualties of the Iraq War, even as it slides off the front pages. It has worn on the national psyche for more than 5 years. Yet that was not worthy of any mention; that reeks of hackdom.• We are barely a quarter or two into what is still not acknowledged as a recession by many. The danger, reflected in Sentiment data, is that the economy rolls into something far uglier --a deeper and more prolonged contraction.As to the broader state of the economy, let me direct the author of this one column to yesterday's Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) earnings. The economic bellwether's report were nothing short of fugly. FedEx management issued an  inflationary-recession view of the economy. FedEx lost $241m due to what they called ""soaring fuel costs and a very difficult economic environment."" They are primarily a business-to-business shipper, but UPS, their more consumer oriented competitor, had very similar things to say. In terms of future guidance, FedEx CFO Alan Graf said that the coming year will be “very difficult due to the weak U.S. economy and extremely high fuel prices.”Gee, that doesn't sound like our economic woes are psychosomatic. ~~~We have discussed over the past 5 years how inflation is so much worse than reported.

We had a great report from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Wednesday night, I expect Research in Motion (RIMM) to be good, Nike (NYSE:NKE)
was great overseas, poor in the USA (what's new?), and the market can
rally off these things but a company like UPS or FedEx intertwines
through all parts of the economy. Some of the commentary in their earnings report is quite foreboding...So
we see these same trends over and over (Nike for example Wednesday night) -
struggling US economy offset by strong growth overseas. This is why I
have been and continue to have a hedge short on the Russell 2000
instead of S&P 500; Russell 2000 has far more smaller companies
which are reliant on the USA and have little to no overseas exposure.
So those stocks will suffer more since they have no help from overseas,
as opposed to US multinationals.With that said, at what point
does overseas slowdown? The tail does not wag the dog... for long. Much
of the world's growth is based on Western World consumption,
specifically good ole US of A. All these corporate profits by the
multinationals are surviving by saying ""well at least we have Asia
growing"". But what if Asia slows from 11-12% GDP growth to even 6%?
Then where will profit growth come from? Just something to keep in
mind. Right now even these multinationals are like sitting on stools
with one leg missing. If another leg falls (international growth) you are
going to be falling straight to the ground. Will make for a very
interesting 2008...Last point - when the transports/logistic
companies are faced with higher fuel costs, they increase their
surcharges to their corporate customers... (i.e. raise prices) i.e.
inflation. Again, this is either eaten by corporations (meaning lower
profit margins) or passed along to us peons (consumers) - so someone
has to suffer. There is no escaping the ""worldwide tax"" that is energy
inflation. Thankfully our politicians are taking great steps to
alleviate this such as continuing subsidies to oil companies and
farmers who grow ethanol, and pushing out alternative energy
incentives. Glad they are on our side! Woo hoo.Disclosure: No positions"

Clearly FedEx sees this as a great opportunity to use their growing international business to grab market share by taking advantage of a weak domestic trucking market to further squeeze their competition, including Arkansas Best (ABFS), Conway (NYSE:CNW), and Yellow Roadway (NASDAQ:YRCW). 
With many truckers continuing to see year-over-year volume reductions, price reductions kick out another leg of the profitability stool for these companies. On many first quarter earnings calls, the saving grace for LTL truckload providers was a stable price environment despite reduced volumes. Managements trumpeted how consolidation in the LTL industry has made pricing more rational among competitors and profitability should therefore remain stable. To make matters worse for investors in these truckers, they are still trading at premium P/E multiples (while the denominator - earnings - are at risk).
As I've discussed previously, one of the keys in my investment process is to invest in industries with the wind behind their back and truckers have the wind squarely in their face. For industries with the wind in their face, while the primary risk is the expected bad results, the really important secondary risk  is the unexpected even worse developments -- such as increased competition or further fundamental deterioration.

Receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here: Absolutely, Positively No One's Safe by Michael Santoli Summary: Steady growth numbers and exposure to the relatively stable ground and freight transport sector are two reasons shipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) could be attractive to potential buyers, says Streetwise editor Michael Santoli. With an enterprise value of $35 billion ($34b market cap and $1b debt) it's big, but recent buyouts of well-run large growth companies like First Data (FDC), Alltel (NYSE:AT), Harrah's Entertainment (HET) and Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) suggest LBO firms are attracted to sturdy large-cap growth companies of its ilk. Recent hesitance in the LBO-debt market would not likely be an issue in a FedEx buyout considering its real assets, including 700 aircraft and 44,000 trucks. A full 70% of FedEx's $3.5 billion planned capital spending in 2007 is growth oriented. And FedEx's underperforming Kinko's unit is attractive to fix-it-up oriented private equity buyers. Even without a deal, shares are reasonable at 15x 2008e earnings. Rival United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) faces another potential strike next year.

But FDX reports on Wednesday, and fundamentally speaking they have not been doing so hot. But the recently strong retail numbers make me think about them. A review of their chart indicates the SMAs are generally moving upward, and the MACD support a bullish run. In my opinion, if no catalyst is present (to change the fundamental picture of FDX) it could trend to 116. However, FDX reports on Wednesday, and if they cannot meet the current expectations, the stock will be in a lot of hurt. If they meet or beat, the benefit is to the upside. If you want a play here, playing the FDX stock is a good idea. Or buy the 115 Oct Calls, along with the 110 July Puts (for the short term protection).

Most market participants will never know the reasoning behind this move.  Those summarizing it on TV cite it as further evidence of a weak economy.
What does the report say?
First, it says there is no risk to near-term earnings.  Next, it says that the stock is trading at a significant discount to historical one, three, and five-year average valuations.
In short, the market is already anticipating bad news.  And these values were before the analyst report took the stock down another 4%.
So what is the basis for the downgrade?
The analyst thinks that economic conditions will deteriorate so he is making a ""macro call.""  This is exactly the point I have been making about current street research.  Analysts do not stick to what they do well -- covering the company and it's business.  They instead become economic forecasters, calling the top of the economic cycle.  They are not experts at this and have a poor record trying to do it, but the post-2000 era encourages them to find downgrades.
The second basis for the downgrade is that FDX supposedly experiences multiple compression in the time after a Fed tightening cycle ends.  The analyst provides a table showing that PE multiples are about 10-20% lower a few months after the cycle.  (Coincidentally (??), this is about the size of the current discount.
The research report provides a table to verify this.  It shows two things:
So there you have it -- the basis for a billion-dollar haircut in the Fed Ex market cap.  This is the reverse of the 2000 bubble era where analysts found reasons to take stocks to unprecedented valuation levels.

The Kinkos operation reported disappointing results as revenues actually declined and operating margins shrunk in half to a minuscule 1.5%. The only clear reason for Fedex to want Kinkos is to capture package volume at the ground level and maintain market share. Most of Kinkos has nothing to do with Fedex’s core competency so it is not surprising that they are not getting it right. The press release has some corporate speak about retraining, refocusing on core resources and sales work force reorganization. Management has stepped on the gas and opened 86 new units in the first half and promises to open 200 new units during Fiscal 07. No mention of closures. As Kinkos becomes larger, Fedex may have to reconsider their co-dependency problem and spin this one out while retaining a strategic relationship.
Fuel charges also dropped dramatically in Q2 contributing to very positive results. But as any airline knows, this is a fleeting benefit which frequently disappears with the next geo-political problem. Overall YTD fuel costs are still up 11%. Fuel charges are problematic. Fedex is still small enough and has the financial clout to buy into an energy company and control its fuel costs. Fuel is vastly more important than photocopies."

Transportation analyst Ed Wolfe of Bear Stearns notes that such an acquisition would be accretive to FedEx’ earnings per share. Don’t be fooled by that logic, as it is just a function of FDX trading at 20x earnings while the truckers trade at less than 10x.

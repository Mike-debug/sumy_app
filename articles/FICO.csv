But Fair Isaac does much more than provide a credit score number to the car salesman. In fact, the company makes many products that enable various businesses to make better business decisions. Fair Isaac was founded in 1956 on the premise that, when used intelligently, data can improve business decisions. Thus, leading the company to create many mathematical algorithms to predict consumer behavior were packaged into applications, services, and software.Fair Isaac operates in three segments, Applications, Scores, and Decision Management Software. The company offers products ranging from credit scores to fraud solutions to decision-making tools. Fair Isaac Corp. has a stable and growing product line, but to invest in the company, you'll have to pay for a lofty valuation. As a value and growth at the right price investor, I am kicking myself for missing the March low of $177 but I'm staying out of the company for now. Source: SEC 10-KsOver the past five years, Fair Isaac has seen great revenue growth. The CAGR for revenues over the period was 6.71%. As can be seen, operating revenue and net income also had great growth, with both posting CAGRs of 12.98% and 17.15%.The Applications segment is the largest, producing 52% of revenues and offers industry-tailored decision-making applications such as the FICO Marketing Suite, FICO Fraud Prediction, and more. The Scores segment makes up 36% of revenue and provides scores that provide consistent/objective credit risk. The main product of the Scores segment is the FICO Scores product that many banks, lenders, and credit organizations use across the U.S. The Decision Management Software segment offers on-premise analytic decision-making tools for businesses such as the FICO Decision Management Suite.The second graph shows that revenue growth has been coming from all segments. In particular, Scores has seen high growth over the five years. In 2019, Scores revenue grew 25% and in 2018 grew 29%! To go along with this, Applications grew 7% in 2019, while Decision Management Software grew 34%. The growth in Scores is great news, as this segment has the highest operating margin of the bunch at 86%! Applications and Decision Management Software have operating margins of 27% and -26%, respectively. Fair Isaac has made a push to move product offerings from on-premise to cloud-based. Cloud-based products are being applied to Applications and Decision Management Software and should help boost margins in the future. As of 2019, 39% of all bookings were for cloud-based products. In the third graph are Fair Isaac's margins over time. What can be seen is the other factor that has added to the bottom line. As a percent of revenue, the cost of revenue and SG&A have decreased from around 31% and 37% to 29% and 36% in 2019. Fair Isaac Corp. focused on gaining revenue from recurring cloud-based products. This approach costs less than an on-premise-focused model and has contributed to the lower-cost margins. The results of this strong revenue growth and lower costs have been a large bump in operating and net margins.Everything was great in 2019, but 2020 offers a much different business landscape. With three quarters in the books, Fair Isaac has not seen any large effects from COVID-19. In the first quarter, the company had revenue growth of 14%. This was followed up by 11% growth in quarter two and a flat quarter three, combining for a nine-month total growth rate of 8%. Breaking down the nine-month growth shows that Scores was again the major gainer. Scores revenue grew 23%, while Decision Management Software grew 17%, and Applications declined 5%.For the nine months, the cost of revenue and SG&A as a percent of revenue continued to decline to 29% and 34%. Operating income increased by 15%, and net income increased by 29% compared to last year. Total bookings so far have been down from last year at 302 million compared to 321 million. So far, Fair Isaac has earned $5.92 per share for the common stockholder. As can be seen by the above results, there have not been any disruptions from the pandemic. Looking at the most recent quarter, balance sheet, Fair Isaac Corp. has a current ratio of 1.05x and a debt-to-equity of 5.33x. The current ratio is good and shows solid liquidity. The debt to equity is okay and is manageable with a times interest earned in 2019 of 6.38x. Overall, these metrics are fine as the company is not experiencing any stress from the pandemic. Fair Isaac also has historically good returns on assets and invested capital. The 10-year average ROA and ROIC are 8.76% and 12.65%. Fair Isaac Corp. is currently trading at $426 per share. My conservative 2020 EPS forecast is $7.74, therefore, the company trades at a P/E of 55.04x. With a book value per share of $8.25, Fair Isaac also trades at a P/B of 51.63x. Fair Isaac Corp. does offer stable and growing top and bottom lines, but the PEG using a conservative growth rate of 23% is high at 2.39x.Fair Isaac Corp. is a business that has a great core product line that is growing. Revenue growth over the past five years has been at a 6.71% clip, while net income has grown at 17.15%. The main growth driver has been the Scores segment, which boasts prior-year revenue growth of 25% and operating margins of 86%. With the company moving toward cloud-based applications and software, costs should decrease over time. Fair Isaac has not seen any negative effects from COVID-19, and the business should succeed in the long term. With that being said, the valuation is lofty. This is my first time taking a deeper dive into the company, and I am disappointed I missed the March low of $177. Overall, I am looking for value and growth at the right price, which I do not think Fair Isaac Corp. offers at the moment."
4380617,20599,2020-10-22T13:43:31-04:00,"Fair Isaac Corp. is considered to be a leader in fintech, data analytics, and business software and automation.They are best known for their “FICO score” - a three-digit number meant to assess consumer credit risk.Fair Isaac is considered to be one of the greatest stocks of the last decade and has gained over 1,700%.","It is rare to find a stock that is so consistently strong over days, months, years, and decades. There is a stock out there which has churned out consistent returns decade after decade. Despite gaining over 1,700% in the last decade, this stock has even more upside in the 2020s. While stocks like Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) get most of the glory as pure growth stocks and darlings of the 2010s, Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is a strong stable name that has been ranked as one of the Top 10 stocks of the last 10 years.Fair Isaac is a company that’s been around since the 1950s and is an important cog and staple in consumer lending and assessor of consumer credit risk. But what makes Fair Isaac so unique is that they are so innovative and adaptable. While the company is best known for consumer lending and assessing consumer risk through its FICO score, it has become a top FinTech innovator involved in business automation and AI, data analytics, and software.Fair Isaac is an extremely important company in US society. Why? It is a staple when it comes to consumer lending and assessing credit risk. Fair Isaac is most known for their FICO score - their credit scoring service. When someone is discussing their credit score, it almost certainly refers to their FICO.FICO scores have been the standard for decades and is a vital component of credit health. This score influences everything ranging from the amount of credit that's available to a person, and the terms that lenders may offer. Every single means of obtaining credit, whether for a credit card, an auto loan or a mortgage follows from the score.Simply put, lenders want to know how much risk they are taking when lending out money. This is especially true in 2020. No matter what the macro level economic conditions are, people will always want loans, and lenders will always want to understand their risks. No matter what the situation, lenders will want to see a credit report and a credit score based on the information in the report. Arguably, the FICO score has never been as important as it is today.Fair Isaac has been the gold standard in credit scoring for decades and decades. However, what makes Fair Isaac such an attractive company, is they are continuing to evolve and innovate. They are considered one of the top 25 FinTech innovators in the world. Just as Fair Isaac innovated in the late 1950s with their FICO score, they are innovating in the 2020s through machine learning, business automation, data analytics, and software. Two thirds of Fair Isaac’s revenue comes from selling software for business functions, including fraud detection.As mentioned before, Fair Isaac is considered to be one of the greatest stocks of the last decade, gaining ~1,700% since 2010. However, if 2020 has shown anything, it has shown that Fair Isaac is such a stable fixture, that it is relatively immune to COVID downturns. While the stock bottomed in March, along with the broader market, it’s up by approximately 17% since January and has gained 106.5% since it bottomed March 18. But analysts, despite Fair Isaac’s relatively expensive valuation, believe that the company has more room to run with an average upside price target of around 11%.Estimates Keep Growing After Beating Earnings In 3 of Last 4 Quarters Stocks overall have seen a consistently upwards trajectory in earnings estimates this quarter. But the changes in Fair Isaac’s earnings estimates are largely due to the fact that they have not only beaten estimates in the last three of four quarters, but they have crushed them. Fair Isaac beat earnings in Q3 2019 by 19.60%, Q1 2020 by 21.60%, and Q2 2020 by 19.40%.But this isn’t all. Fair Isaac’s earnings estimates for the current quarter are actually projected to outperform the same quarter last year, pre-pandemic! While other companies are experiencing earnings upgrades for Q3, they are still drastically lower than the same quarter last year. Their average estimate for EPS this quarter is $2.32 a share, up from $2.01 a year ago. This is also a distinct upgrade from their Q3 estimate of $2.09 three months ago.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAnalysts are also forecasting Fair Isaac’s EPS to grow by 14.80% next year, and by 16.10% over the next 5 years per annum.Outside of growing earnings estimates, Fair Isaac, as mentioned before, has been on quite a run since March, jumping by over 100%. It is also trading 112.4% above its 200-day moving average. But what makes this such an attractive entry point, is that analysts see more room to run despite its relatively high P/E ratio. There is a consensus 11.1% price upside, on top of all of its earnings upgrades and projections. Fair Isaac’s sales growth is also projected to grow by 3.60% this year, with an 8% CAGR over the next 5 years.Furthermore, the company’s return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) show how efficiently they generate profit from their assets and their equity, with outstanding numbers of 15.8% and 89.9% respectively. Their figures of current ratio and quick ratio also indicate that they can meet all of their short-term obligations, with figures of 1.0 and .9 respectively.Let’s compare Fair Isaac to four of its main competitors: Fiserv (FISV), Equifax (EFX), ACI Worldwide (ACIW), and Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY). All of these companies are involved in some form of FinTech, credit scoring, or business analytics.Let’s first compare Fair Isaac’s ROA and ROE to their competitors. If we graph this out by taking the ROA as the X-axis, and the ROE as the Y-axis, we can visually see how much more efficient and profitable Fair Isaac’s assets and equity are compared to the four competitors.Source: FinboxNo other company even comes close to Fair Isaac’s numbers. Fiserv, ACI Worldwide, and Equifax's ROA and ROE are relatively underwhelming, and the only company remotely close is Jack Henry & Associates with a ROA of 12.9%. But even their ROE of 19.9% does not come close to Fair Isaac’s.Now let’s compare how each of these stocks has performed over the past decade. This is another illustration of how no competitor even comes close to Fair Isaac's performance over the long term.And if we compare the returns in the short term since the bottom of March 18th, we can see that the competitors still don’t compare to Fair Isaac.While Fair Isaac has jumped over 100% since March 18th, none of its competitors have even come close. ACI Worldwide and their returns of 46% since March aren’t even half of what Fair Isaac’s are.While Fair Isaac’s P/E ratio, both trailing and forward, is high at 54.7x and 49.3x, it is middle of the pack compared to its competitors.High P/E Ratio: Fair Isaac has an astronomically high P/E ratio. While other high-flying tech names may have a higher P/E ratio than Fair Isaac, and while Fair Isaac’s P/E ratio is relatively middle of the pack relative to its competitors, this is still something to be mindful of. The stock has moved high during difficult economic conditions, and having an overstretched valuation is something to be cautious and mindful of.Holds Significant Long-Term Liabilities: This is also something to be very mindful of. Although Fair Isaac has the clear ability to pay off its short-term debts, and has very little bankruptcy risk, looking at their balance sheet shows more long-term liabilities than ideal. In fact, their total long-term liabilities significantly outweigh their total equity. While in the short term this is not an issue, in the long term it could be an issue if the economic recovery continues to lag.Lag in More Stimulus: This is a macro-level risk that every stock is confronting. The question that companies have to answer is “what will happen to our stock if this impasse in stimulus talks continues?” This market is built on a house of cards right now. Stock valuations and price levels, including Fair Isaac’s, are not sustainable unless there is a second stimulus package and potentially more monetary policy help from the Fed.There are certainly risks for this stock, and any stock. However, Fair Isaac is such a fixture that is a hybrid of stability and innovation, that the concerns are frankly low. They are a profitable and efficient company that has truly cornered their industry with a niche. This is over the course of decades, not months or weeks. Fair Isaac truly has an answer for all of their risks, and they are clearly more than capable to persevere and grow no matter what the conditions are.*Like this article?

4312953,104609,2019-12-17T14:00:00-05:00,"The Fair Issac Corporation has continued to expand its dominance in the consumer credit rating algorithm business.While innovative efforts have doubled revenue over the past decade, the stock has risen over 17X.Based on normal PE levels and the company's stagnant margins, they'll need to grow revenue 250-350% more for their current valuation to be justified.FICO has also borrowed considerably in recent years and has repurchased so much equity that they now are running low on cash reserves.Growing antitrust sentiment in the U.S poses a potential risk to the company.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.The Fair Issac Corporation (FICO) has become a household name due to its general monopoly on the personal credit rating business. Without a doubt, they have been an extremely innovative company. Over the past decade, they have pioneered A.I rating technologies, and have expanded their software base for clients. They have even created a much better system to measure cybersecurity risk called FICO Cyber Risk Score. Most of these innovations have resulted in revenue and earnings growth.That said, innovation does not necessarily make a stock a ""buy"". In many instances, the mass public perception of innovation pushes valuations to highly unreasonable levels, giving companies shoes they cannot conceivably grow into. I believe FICO is such a firm today.To illustrate, take a look at its long-term stock price:Now, what goes up needn't go down for financial assets, but the reality is that a company cannot be worth more than the discounted value of its future cash flows plus the liquidation value of its assets. As will be explained, it is highly unlikely FICO will achieve the revenue growth its stock is currently priced for.We must also consider regulatory risk as congress, as well as the public, are becoming increasingly wary of monopolies. As one example, the Federal Housing Finance Agency which controls the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recently ruled that they must consider alternative rating systems like Equifax's (EFX) VantageScore.FICO's massive price rally has been a consistent factor in the market, beating the S&P 500 just every year during the 2010s and netting a 1730% total gain, beating Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL).To a certain extent, these gains were initially justified by fundamentals as the company made significant improvements and saw steady revenue and income gains. However, performance over the past three years does not appear to be justified, particularly when FICO's (somewhat ironic) increase in leverage is concerned.Take a look at the company's price, revenue, and P/S ratio below:As you can see, revenue growth has been extremely high, but price growth has been much higher. Since 2010 the company has doubled its quarterly revenue but seen its stock price increase 17X.The result is similar when looking at the company's income and operating cash flow:In fact, while their revenue has grown considerably, there have been few increases in efficiency metrics. Across the board, margins are about the same as they were 20 years ago and recent revenue gains have been dependent on labor growth:This begs the question, can FICO continue to increase revenue at their current rate? Most large-cap U.S equities today have a P/E ratio of 24X and have a historical average P/E ratio of 15X so I would estimate that, given no improvement in operating margins, they'll need to boost revenue 240% to 380% in order for their PE ratio to be in the normal range. Remember, they have only increased revenue by 95% over the past 10 years, a strong figure but a much lower rate than necessary to justify the current stock price.To my surprise, FICO has increased its leverage considerably over the past decade. While it is partly understandable considering today's low-interest rates, investors do not appear to be taking debt into account.As you can see in the charts below, the company has increased its liabilities and interest expense considerably since the 2000s:It appears that a significant portion of this debt buildup has not been used to grow operations, but to buy back shares and thereby increase internal leverage.As I've said before, it is completely reasonable for a clearly undervalued company to use its income to buyback stock. However, it is not reasonable for a company to buyback its stock when it is at such an extreme valuation, particularly when doing so will put cash reserves in jeopardy.As you can see below, excessive buybacks have caused FICO's cash reserves to run very low:In fact, the company now has less current assets than current liabilities meaning they'll need to raise cash this year and either further increase leverage or put an end to buybacks.No matter what, they have considerable credit downgrade risk. They currently have a subpar Ba2 rating by Moody's and BB+ by S&P which has not changed in some time despite recent increases to leverage and falling liquidity metrics, as well as an expected 2% revenue loss due to the FHFA decision.Ironically, I cannot give FICO a good score when it comes to their balance sheet metrics.While this is more speculative, I believe investors are also not properly discounting competition risk for FICO. For now, they have near-total domination of the credit rating business, but calls for competition are growing. The market shrugged off FHFA's decision to call for considering VantageScore, but it may only be the beginning of clients questioning FICO's grasp.Admittedly, I am no expert on personal credit rating and am indifferent considering the efficacy of Fair Issac's rating system vs. Vantagescore's. But, in all likelihood, even a small increase in market share from a competitor would legitimize the alternative scoring system and potentially cause a rapid shift away from FICO. The ""network effects"" keeping FICO's dominant position is indeed incredibly strong, but investors would still be smart to discount this risk.From a fundamental standpoint, FICO is a clear ""sell"". The company is extremely expensive, has a considerable debt burden, and is not growing revenue at a pace necessary to justify its valuation. While they have been highly innovative over the recent decade, it is uncertain that revenue will continue to grow at such a rate.Based on its current valuation and fundamentals, I believe the fair value of the stock is closer to $100. If they fail to break the $360-$370 level I may short the stock."
4336989,105400,2020-04-10T13:10:49-04:00,"Fair Isaac has experienced steady growth in recent years, mainly from its strong brand.The company also has enough free cash flow at $220M to invest in growth and tide through difficult times.Fair Isaac seems overvalued by 16% based on my estimates. Its relative valuation also points to a more expensive price.","Fair Isaac's (NYSE:FICO) stock price has fallen roughly 30% from its recent high, mostly due to multiple adjustments from the recent market turmoil. Despite the drop in share price, I believe that Fair Isaac has a strong track record with a strong brand and growing switching costs. At $297, however, it is overvalued by roughly 16% based on my base-case assumptions.The company has achieved decent revenue growth in recent years. Revenue has grown from $605M in 2010 to $1.2B in 2019, compounding above 7% year on year. Throughout the same period, gross margins have maintained around 70%.Fair Isaac has a few segments such as marketing applications, customer experience management, and global fraud detection and prevention. These are large markets, which shows that Fair Isaac still has a long runway for growth. (Source: Investor Presentation)Fair Isaac has more than 90% of the market share when it comes to consumer credit lending decisions. By being the industry standard, there are high barriers to entry for new companies that want to replicate similar services. This competitive advantage helps Fair Isaac protect its high margins.(Source: Investor Presentation)Fair Isaac's other segments also contain many integrations with various data sources: (Source: Latest 10K)These integrations increase the switching costs for the Fair Isaac. As companies adopt more services using Fair Isaac's platforms, they become more entrenched with time. Companies generally do not want to risk lost data and productivity which leads to business disruption. An imperfect data migration could lead to huge amounts of frustration and business risk that would cause any company to think twice about switching from Fair Isaac.To ensure that Fair Isaac does not run into liquidity issues, one way to determine that is to monitor its cash and debt balances, as well as its cash-burn rate.Looking at its latest balance sheet, Fair Isaac has $111M of cash and $738M of long term debt. Given that Fair Isaac's free cash flow for fiscal 2019 was roughly $220M, it gives them ample room to pay back the debt or refinance it in the future. This provides a large cushion for Fair Isaac to invest in growth. It also helps Fair Isaac tide through any operational difficulties in this volatile period.(Source: Latest 10K)When the economy experiences a downturn, customers might cut back on non-essential services to conserve cash flow. If these businesses deem that Fair Isaac is not crucial to their operations due to the reduction of lending activities, it might lead to a sharp decline in revenues for Fair Isaac.Fair Isaac faces competitors in this space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform or switching from Fair Isaac to other platforms. There are many agencies that have come up with their own ratings like Equifax (NYSE:EFX). Fair Isaac has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.(Source: Author creation using Fair Isaac financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for Fair Isaac is roughly $7.1B for the entire company. This represents a 16% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for most companies, my point estimate valuation of $247.60 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against some other companies.(Source: Atom Finance) Peer analysis shows that Fair Isaac's EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/E ratios all seem slightly higher than the median. This might imply that Fair Isaac is expensive on a relative valuation basis. However, its consensus growth rates of 7.4% are higher than the median-peer growth rates of 6%, while Fair Isaac's EBITDA margin is in line with the median. Hence, the slightly expensive pricing could be justified. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Fair Isaac will be able to execute better than my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be weaker and future sales growth is better than expected, Fair Isaac might actually be a good buy."
4282488,95006,2019-08-07T06:18:21-04:00,"This analysis of FICO's stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It analyzes expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean, earnings growth, and business returns that weight returns to shareholders more heavily.The article concludes whether FICO is a buy, sell, or hold.","SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of highly cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they are still usually subject to the short-term debt cycle (or business cycle) and to changes in sentiment (which can sometimes also have a cyclical quality about it). Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with ""classic cyclicals"" and applying them to less-cyclical stocks. And, today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes. It just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest, I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main difference you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels; and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is not currently a ""buy"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is the stock will trade low enough to become a ""buy"" over the next 4-5 years if we have a recession.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the three main drivers of future total returns: 1) Market Sentiment Returns, 2) Full-Cycle Organic Earnings Growth Returns, and 3) Shareholder-Weighted Business Returns. Then, I combine all three of those CAGR estimates together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected CAGR > 15% a ""buy,"" 12-15% an ""outperform,"" 8-12% a ""market perform,"" 4-8% an ""underperform"" and < 4% a ""sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I like to examine. Let's take a look at Fair Isaac Corp.'s (FICO) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate,"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And, last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.Leading into the recession of 2008/9, FICO's EPS slowly fell about -24% off its highs of 2005. Other than that multi-year decline, earnings have mostly been steady for FICO the past 20 years. Earnings declines of this magnitude I consider low-to-moderate, and on a scale of 1-8, I would classify FICO's earnings cyclicality a '3'. For earnings of this type, it is reasonable to use a 10-year full-cycle analysis rather than a shorter-term price-based analysis.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts about 2005, a little before the last cyclical peak.FICO's current blended P/E is 52.45 while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 22.37. If, over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 22.37 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -8.18%.If we begin our measurement around the same point we were at last cycle, which I estimate to be about 2005, and we adjust the annually compounded EPS growth for the amount of stock that was repurchased over this time period, we can estimate how much CAGR from organic earnings growth we can expect over the next 10 years if the next cycle is similar to the previous one.Data by YChartsFICO has bought back a whole lot of shares this cycle, and that has helped to boost their EPS. I'll back these buybacks out, and assume that at some point in the next ten years we'll have a recession. Doing so will give a cyclically adjusted organic growth rate.When I do the math on that, I get a 10-year, full-cycle, organic earnings CAGR estimate of -1.79%. That is a pretty low cyclically adjusted organic growth rate, so I'm going to check it against their net income over this period to make sure it makes sense.Data by YChartsThis tells pretty much the same story. It took FICO about 13 years to earn the same net income they had in 2005, and only the past year or two have they earned more than that. So, if we are near peak cyclical earnings again, then FICO very well could earn less money over the next ten years compared to what one would expect if earnings simply stayed flat for the next 10 years. If FICO experiences a similar cycle as last time, it very well could have quite big earnings declines once buybacks are taken away.Obviously, the banking industry was hit hard last recession, so one should keep that in mind. It might not be as bad the next time around. But this is a reasonable base-case judging from the last economic cycle. Additionally, net income fell ~60% off its highs in the 1990 and 2002 downturns as well, but it bounced back faster than in 2008 during those downturns. So, even if next time is different than 2008, it might not be too much different in terms of stock price decline. (FICO's price fell -75% off its highs in the post-2001 market.)These return estimates are more complicated than the first two, but the idea behind this is to figure out how much the company is making in cash and/or earnings per share while taking into account debt and cash levels, how much of a dividend yield it is paying to shareholders, what percentage of shares it is buying back annually, and how much cash the company is keeping for itself, all on a per-share basis. Once that is complete, I assume any money the business keeps for itself will accrue over a 10-year time period, but I don't assume that it will compound (since I estimated the earnings growth in the last section).For buybacks, if the company is buying back shares when sentiment is below average, I will assume the value of the buybacks will compound over time. If they are buying back when sentiment is higher than average, I will assume the buybacks accrue but do not compound value over the 10-year time period. (This is just a way to weight the value of buybacks over time for the estimate, it isn't intended to be mathematically precise - which is fine for me, because we never know exactly what price the buybacks will be made over time anyway, so there's no sense in pretending we do.) I will assume that dividends paid to shareholders compound their value over time, because shareholders can immediately reinvest the dividends in the best investment available.As I noted, this process is intended to estimate how much money the business is likely to make and how much of that money will likely be returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I limit the expectation of shareholder returns by how much cash is currently being generated and the company's apparent intention of investing that cash itself or returning it to shareholders. If buybacks and dividends are consistently greater than cash flows and earnings, I will assume they are unsustainable through a full cycle that includes a recession, and I limit the shareholder return expectations to actual cash flows and/or earnings estimates I think are reasonable.First, let's revisit those buybacks and see what sort of returns we might expect from them in the future. I'll look at both 1-year and 3-year time frames.Data by YChartsData by YChartsBuybacks have leveled off this past year, but over the past three years, they have been about 2% per year, so I'll use that number as my buyback estimate. FICO doesn't pay a dividend.Now let's check to see if the earnings yield can support 2% buyback expectation:Data by YChartsFICO's earnings are basically all going toward share buybacks. Since these buybacks are being made while the stock is trading above its long-term P/E ratio, I'll assume these accrue but don't compound over the next 10 years, which gives us an expected CAGR of +1.96%.Personally, I like to use a more conservative estimate for long-term shareholder/business returns that raises expected returns for companies with higher cash and lower debt levels and lowers expectations for companies with higher debt levels and lower cash levels. For this, I use a free cash flow-to-equity/enterprise value yield.Data by YChartsAs of the end of last quarter, their FCFE/EV yield was +1.40% so I'll use that as my conservative shareholder/business return estimate.Putting all three - market sentiment returns (-8.18%), earnings growth returns (-1.79%) and business/shareholder returns (+1.40% to +1.96%) - together, I estimate a full-cycle 10-year CAGR return of -8.01% to -8.57%. These sort of expected long-term results make FICO a ""strong sell"".Quite often I'll do an opportunity risk/reward analysis here, but really all one needs to understand is that during recessions, FICO typically falls -65% to -75% off its highs. There is virtually no way that this company can grow earnings enough over the next few years to have the potential upside outweigh the potential downside if we have a recession at any time within the next 5 years. An investor not taking profits in FICO here needs to have a very certain understanding of why this time around is different than the last three cycles going back to the late 1980s."
4312263,67113,2019-12-12T19:44:24-05:00,Shares may be undergoing a double top reversal.Earnings multiple has spiked to 55.Book and sales multiples are also well above their averages.,"The software and application company ""Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO)"" has been on a relentless rally since its multi-year bottom in 2009. Share price growth actually accelerated in 2019 before shares finally topped out above $370 in September. The question now is whether that September top will end up being a firm top for the time-being. In late November, shares actually tried to break above the September high but failed to do so.This means we have the distinct possibility that shares at present are undergoing a double top reversal formation. Unless the October lows are significantly breached, we will not have confirmation of this reversal pattern. In fact, given the relentless rally shares have enjoyed over the past decade, all that may be happening here is some sideway action before we get some type of launch higher in the share price once more.Although the technical indicators look significantly overbought at present, getting short at this juncture would be a mistake in our opinion. The reason being is that there is not enough evidence that a sustained bearish move is ahead of us. We would need at least the October lows to be taken out before one should even contemplate a short-term bearish position here.Being long-term value investors, FICO is at the opposite end of the spectrum with respect to how we invest. This is not to say that the average investor should not look into aggressive growth stocks. It's just that we like to stack the odds in our favour as much as possible when putting our hard-earned money on the line.First off, on to the p/e ratio. Fair Isaac's price to earnings ratio has risen to 55.9 which is well ahead of the firm's 5-year average of 35.1. In 2009, Fico's p/e ratio was 14.6 and by 2011, it had jumped to 20 (which is above the long-term average of 17 in the S&P 500). Since then, FICO's p/e ratio has increased along with the share-price aggressively. Therefore, what we are saying here is that there is every possibility that FICO's share price keeps on increasing in value. The software company's operating profit, for example, has grown by 15% on average per year over the last three years. Furthermore, analysts who follow this stock expect strong sustained double-digit earnings growth to continue going forward.Nevertheless, the higher the p/e ratio goes, the more real the risk becomes. Investing in growth stocks is all about timing, but in the long-run, there is some type of reversion to the mean with respect to valuation.On the assets side, Fair Isaac has a very high book multiple at present of 35.4. This key metric, for example, back in 2009, came in at only 1.7. We like to buy a firm's assets as cheap as possible.For every $1 an investor invests in FICO at present, one receives just under $0.03 in assets. Why is this metric important? Well, assets are essentially what lead to profits. Think of property, goodwill, intangibles, etc. Assets are essentially what make sales and earnings happen. The more of them you have on the balance sheet, the better. Suffice it to say, because of the huge up-move in the firm's market cap in recent times, FICO's assets are most definitely not on sale at the moment.Now, obviously, FICO has been able to leverage its assets to produce outstanding sales growth over the past decade. To see how expensive the company's sales are at present, we go to the sales multiple which presently comes in at 9.3. Again, we see significant over-valuation here as the company's 5-year average comes in at a mere 4.3.The book multiple and sales multiple are probably the two most important valuation metrics. James O'Shaughnessy documented the importance of these metrics in his book ""What Works On Wall-Street"" O'Shaughnessy's research showed that a low P/S along with a low P/B performed the best (when used together) out of a host of different valuation metric pairs. This would then lead us to believe that when these key metrics are both well above their averages, it would at least alert us to being cautious concerning a long investment with the respective stock at hand.To sum up, what we want to say off the bat is that Fair Isaac has been an excellent long over the past decade. In fact, its projected numbers going forward give a strong likelihood that the upward trend will continue. However, from our own perspective, there comes a time when one has to look at the valuation no matter how solid the firm may appear. If the double top pattern plays out, price could easily drop back towards the $200 per share mark. At this point, we would take a seriously look at this company."

FICO's fraud management revenue should grow at similar pace.FICO's fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter revenue came in at $305.3 million compared to $256.5 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $60.8 million or $2.01 per share compared to $41.1 million or $1.34 per share in the prior year period. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $89.6 million compared to $52.9 million in the prior year period. The company delivered excellent results in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company has three operating segments, which are applications, scores and decision management software. Applications revenue came in at $149.9 million compared to $139.0 million in the year-ago period. This indicates the company's pre-configured decision management applications have strong underlying demand in the market. The company's scores revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $115.9 million compared to $89.5 million in the year-ago period. Scores include the company's B2B and B2C scoring solutions. The company's decision management software revenue came in at $39.5 million compared to $28.0 million in the year-ago period. YoY growth in scores revenue and decision management software revenue implies that the company has developed strong products characterized by sustainable demand.The decision management space is highly competitive. FICO competes with Pegasystems (PEGA), Equifax (EFX), Experian (OTCQX:EXPGF), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM) and Moody's (MCO).FICO's competitive advantage is that it can deliver a unique mix of products, extensive expertise in predictive analytics, advanced integration of predictive analytics with decision management software, and enhanced customer management capabilities.FICO's most similar peers are Moody's Corporation, Equifax, Adobe and Salesforce. FICO's non-GAAP forward PE ratio is 42.64x compared to Moody's Corporation's 27.18x, Equifax's 24.76x, Adobe's 38.17x, and Salesforce's 56.87x. FICO's trailing 12-month price to sales ratio is 8.89x compared to Moody's Corporation's 9.10x, Equifax's 4.85x, Adobe's 13.71x, and Salesforce's 8.51x. FICO's trailing 12-month price to cash flow ratio is 39.57x, compared to Moody's Corporation's 26.77x, Equifax's 67.46x, Adobe's 34.88x, and Salesforce's 36.78x.Average non-GAAP forward PE ratio of the above five companies is 37.92x, average price to sales ratio is 9.01x, and average price to cash flow ratio is 41.09x. FICO is richly valued compared to its peers. FICO's balance sheet is not very strong. Its net debt on balance sheet is $724.16 million and net leverage is 2.56x. However, FICO is a compelling growth story. Its valuation reflects that. The digital marketing software market and the customer experience management market are growing at a CAGR of around 15%, and the fraud detection and prevention market is growing at a CAGR of more than 25%. FICO is a prominent player in all these markets. In addition, FICO's scores revenue has grown at a YoY rate of 30% in the fourth quarter. The scores business is growing at an excellent pace indeed.In the last five years, FICO's revenue has grown at a CAGR of 8%. I believe revenue will continue to grow at this rate in the next five years. The company's 2019 revenue is $1160.1 million. At a CAGR of 8%, its 2024 revenue will be $1,705 million or $58.87 per share. In the last one year, FICO's stock has traded in the price to sales ratio of 5.5x and 10x. Applying a price to sales ratio of 10x on the company's 2024 revenue per share, I get $588.70 as FICO's 2024 price. In the short-term, I am neutral on FICO around the current price.The company derives a significant part of its revenue from a small number of products, such as scoring solutions, fraud solutions, marketing solutions, customer management product and decision management software. If the market does not continue to accept one or more of such products, FICO's revenue growth will be negatively impacted.If the company fails to identify and penetrate new markets which it currently does not serve, its revenue growth may slow down. The company intends to grow its revenue by delivering its products through additional distribution channels. If the company fails to develop new distribution channels, its revenue growth could be negatively impacted.FICO offers a small number of products to its customers, which are not enough to grow its business for a long time. The company has to develop new products more frequently including the development of its cloud-based products in order to remain competitive in the market. If the company fails to bring new products to the market in regular intervals, its revenue growth will slow down.In fiscal 2019, the company delivered revenue of $1.16 billion, up 16% from fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, it delivered 11% growth in its software business and 25% growth in its scores business, which are really encouraging. However, this growth is already built into the price of the stock. For the near term, the stock is fully valued. FICO is a good business to own for the long term. I would recommend buying the stock during pullbacks."
4264923,23998,2019-05-17T13:16:52-04:00,"With Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings available now, I was curious to see how they aligned with Portfolio Armor's top ranked names.It turned out that Fair Isaac, Portfolio Armor's current top name, has a ""very bullish"" Seeking Alpha Quant Rating.In the event Fair Isaac shares nevertheless decline over the next several months, I present two ways shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk.","Fair Isaac promotes its use of analytics (photo via Fair Isaac's Twitter page).On Monday, I had the pleasure of hearing about Seeking Alpha's new Quant Rantings from the man who developed them, Steve Cress, during a presentation at Seeking Alpha's New York headquarters. I was excited to see how Portfolio Armor's top ranked names fared on Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings, so on Thursday I looked up the Quant Rating for Portfolio Armor's current top name, Fair Isaac (FICO). As you can see below, its overall SA Quant rating was ""very bullish."" Screen capture via Seeking AlphaAs you can see above, Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating combines five separate ratings: Value, growth, profitability, momentum, and EPS revisions, and FICO scores the highest on momentum. That makes sense given the alignment between the Quant Rating and Portfolio Armor here, as Portfolio Armor ranks securities based in part on their total returns (another component of its ranking is options market sentiment, which is forward looking). It's possible, nevertheless, that FICO will stumble over the next several months, particularly if our current trade tensions lead to a broad market decline. For FICO shareholders who want to stay long but limit their downside risk, below are a couple of ways of doing so. For these examples, I'm making a couple of assumptions. The first is that you have 300 shares of FICO. The second is that you are willing to tolerate a decline of as much as 19% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app. Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, put options to hedge 300 shares of FICO against a greater-than-19% decline by late December. The cost of this put protection was $2,700, or 3.06% of position value, calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (in practice, you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and ask). Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your possible upside at 12% by late December, this was the optimal collar, as of Thursday's close, to protect against the same, >19% decline. A couple of differences you may have noticed with this second hedge: The first is that, after an iterative process taking into account the net cost of the collar, the hedging algorithm was able to use a less expensive strike for the put leg, one where the cost was $2,280, or 2.58% of position value, at the ask. The other difference is that the income generated from selling the call leg was greater than that: $2,820, or 3.19% of position value, calculated conservatively, at the bid. So the net cost here was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $540 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads. A question some readers may have is whether FICO was an outlier among Portfolio Armor's top names in having a ""very bullish"" Seeking Alpha Quant Rating. The answer is no. Out of Portfolio Armor's top 10 names as of Thursday's close, seven had ""very bullish"" SA Quant ratings. In addition to FICO those names were Chipotle (CMG), Qualcomm (QCOM) (which we discussed earlier this month), Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), PayPal (PYPL), and Armstrong World Industries (AWI). It will be interesting to see if this correlation continues going forward. I suspect it will, since positive returns and options market sentiment tends to correlate with positive fundamentals, to some extent."
4337425,20599,2020-04-14T01:21:28-04:00,"Fair Isaac Corporation has been a great long-term compounder for investors and has many great qualities resulting in it deriving a premium multiple.However, currently, I think risks to the downside are greater.Despite a >30% fall from recent highs, valuations remain well above historical and sector averages.","Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) is a predictive analytics company widely known for its consumer credit scoring system. Hitherto, FICO has proved to be a great long-term compounding growth story for investors, outperforming the S&P 500, for years at a stretch. This should come as no surprise, as the company has several admirable qualities, particularly, leadership in key verticals & product categories, end-markets with strong long-term drivers, a strong innovative culture, best-in-class senior management team, consistently good performances across key financial parameters and excellent return on capital ratios. That said, in the current environment, I remain somewhat wary of its ability to live up to heightened expectations and would like to tread with some caution and only revisit a long thesis at lower levels. I highlight some of the key issues that have occupied my mind.Source: Yahoo FinanceSource: Seeking AlphaFICO reports under three verticals - Applications (52% of annual revenue), Scores (36% of annual revenue) and Decision Management, or DM (12% of annual revenue) - and all three segments depend a lot on transactional momentum.On account of the fallout from the coronavirus, you are going to see a drop in the volume of transactions, which is a key driver for FICO, as almost 75% of its revenue is linked to transactional or unit-based pricing. In fact, in the previous fiscal, transactional revenue was the key driver for much of its Applications segment; the Fraud resolution and customer communication business (key sub-segments of the Application vertical) had benefitted on account of increased transactional volume, which is unlikely to be replicated. Incidentally, the Application segment had already been witnessing some muted growth and margin decline even before the coronavirus pandemic struck. In the most recent December quarter, management had stated that they were facing some transition issues in hosting single-tenant clients where margins are lower; they also implied that this lower growth rate pressure would likely continue.FICO is heavily exposed to the banks, insurance, and broad financial services sectors - sectors that likely to be hampered in the near term by low growth prospects, weak sentiment and elevated credit risk. Incidentally, last week, we saw Fitch Ratings downgrade the outlook for both the US auto finance and credit card (corporate level) from stable to negative.Longer term too, FICO might have to adjust to a new norm in pricing in the bankcard industry. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the company had mentioned that the rate of account growth in the U.S. bankcard industry had been slowing mainly due to consolidation in the industry. This consolidation could potentially alter the base of recurring revenue derived from contracts in which the company is paid on a per-transaction basis. FICO currently serves 98 of the 100 largest financial institutions in the U.S. and two-thirds of the largest 100 banks in the world. On the insurance side, it serves more than 700 insurers and 9 of the top 10 American property and casualty insurers. To put things into context, c.88% of revenue comes from sales of products and services to the banking and insurance industries alone.FICO has a somewhat lengthy and inconsistent sales cycle that varies from 60 days to 18 months, and much of this is due to a thrust on cross-selling many products, a lot of which tend to be discretionary in nature. In the current environment, I expect these sales cycles to become more elongated as customers facing financial stress delay their purchases or turn down high-margin discretionary products.One vertical that the FICO management has pegged a lot of the company's future growth strategy on is the largely discretionary-based Decision Management software vertical, which continues to guzzle cash and is yet to post profits. I think this vertical has great prospects for the future, but in the current miserly environment, I expect operational pressures to persist.Source: FICOIn mid-March, reports emerged of FICO being investigated by the DOJ’s Antitrust Division for market dominance in the credit score market; the company’s classic FICO score has been the go-to standard in mortgage underwriting and some segments of consumer credit for over two decades now. This has been perpetuated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and other lenders generally follow. Competitors such as VantageScore Solutions have been pushing their alternative products to the FICO model but haven’t had much success. It remains to be seen what implications could come out of this antitrust investigation, but it doesn’t bode well. Regardless, I am not sure FICO will able to continue to monopolize this space, as earlier this year, the US housing finance regulator had appointed an outside investment bank to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and I believe one of the changes could be faster adoption of alternative credit models to FICO’s.Since 2009, FICO stock has been on a blinding run, forming a steep multi-year bullish channel. However, in keeping with the broader markets, weakness had been seen since February, with March being particularly brutal as the stock broke out of this bull channel and briefly touched the bottom of the previous congestion zone at around $180. Bargain hunters then propped the stock back up, pushing it to close the month within the boundaries of this bull channel.If you look at the texture of the channel, particularly since 2012, you can see it has been rather narrow, with FICO not spending too long consolidating or providing too many opportunities for a pullback. This implies that expectations have been high and the stock has continued to deliver or outperform those expectations. When you set such high growth standards and continue to live up to that, any potential headwinds or a drop-off in growth is likely to be punished more severely. Given the lack of significant upside triggers in the near term, coupled with the potential headwinds in store, I don’t envisage a retest of the upper channel boundary - at around $400-plus levels - anytime soon. Rather, I think the probability of a break and a close below this multi-year channel looks more likely over the next few months. I would then like it to consolidate at the previous congestion zone as highlighted. This would be an ideal zone to consider a long trade with more favorable risk-reward dynamics.Source: TradingViewAnother reason why I think a pullback would be welcome is that valuations continue to be enormously pricey despite a fall of more than 30% from the all-time highs in Feb. FICO currently trades at c.37x forward P/E, a 25% premium over the corresponding 5-year average multiple and an 84% premium over the corresponding sector average. Consider the near-term low growth prospects for most of the end-markets the company caters to, and also consider that it hasn’t paid any dividends for two years - why, then, pay a premium multiple of 37x? Yes, I know FICO does have an ongoing share repurchase program, but I don’t envisage any increase in the share repurchase, as the company has to conserve cash for an $85 million principal payment due on the senior notes in July 2020 and also continue to make investments into the business, especially the DM segment.Source: Seeking AlphaThere’s a lot to admire about FICO, but given certain near-term headwinds and uncertainties, I question if it is worth paying the premium multiple that FICO stock demands. I don’t foresee any significant upside triggers and think the risk is more towards the downside. The stock is trading close to the lower boundary of the multi-year bullish channel, and given some of the risks floating around, I think one could see a break and a close below this boundary. I would be more comfortable reinitiating a long thesis below the $225 levels, where valuations and the price structure could be more favorable. I would also wait for clarity on the anti-trust investigations, as any lingering uncertainty here will keep prices range-bound. I am Neutral for now.*Like this article?

(NYSE:FICO), commonly known as FICO, is a $2.45 billion company with significant growth opportunities. We believe the company's recent acquisition of Tonbeller, a risk-based FCC (financial crime and compliance) solutions provider, will drive the stock significantly higher this year. FICO's Applications and Tools segments are expected to see significant growth as a result of the acquisition. In this article we will delve deeper into the company's growth prospects.Company OverviewFICO provides predictive analytics that enable businesses to take smarter decisions. The company's innovative solutions to predict consumer behavior has revolutionized risk-management for large corporations worldwide. FICO operates in three segments - viz., Applications, Scores, and Tools.The company's Applications segment, which covers a broad range of areas including fraud, collections, marketing, account origination and customer management, among many others, and its Tools segment, which provides various analytic and decision management software tools, are expected to gain from the Tonbeller acquisition. Its Scores segment, which offers B2B scoring solutions and associated professional services for businesses and myFICO B2C solutions for consumers, also is expected to grow on new opportunities.Why Is The Tonbeller Acquisition Positive for FICO?According to a recent review by Deloitte, compliance and risk management will be one of the key focus areas for financial institutions in 2015 as a result of the recent high-profile cyber attacks on some of the largest industry players. FICO is an undisputed leader in fraud detection and analytics. Tonbeller will help the company address the rapidly-growing demand for integrated enterprise-class FCC solutions.We believe the acquisition of Tonbeller will help FICO move into a more strategic position within financial institutions. Most FCC solutions available today for financial institutions are rule-based. With Tonbeller's solutions, FICO will be in a position to offer an innovative risk-based approach. The acquisition will help the company grow its market share in the nascent FCC solutions market by leveraging its fraud analytics and risk management expertise. The company's revenue is expected to grow significantly as a result of the acquisition.New Opportunities for the Scores BusinessCredit scores measure the risk of default and help financial institutions mitigate the risk. FICO is well-positioned in the Scores segment to grow revenue on new opportunities. We believe the following developments will have far-reaching consequences for the company's Scores business:Fundamentals of FICODuring fiscal 2014, FICO's Applications segment revenues increased $28.2 million from the previous year, primarily driven by a $17.3 million increase in the company's fraud solutions. The company's Tools segment revenues grew $11.7 million, driven by a $2.2 million increase in predictive modeling tools. We believe that Tonbeller's solutions can drive FICO's fraud solutions revenues by approximately 10% in the current fiscal over fiscal 2014. As a result, its applications segment revenues could increase $30 million in fiscal 2015. Tools segment revenues can grow $12-13 million as Tonbeller's solutions can boost FICO's predictive modeling tools sales. Scores segment revenues are expected to increase $7-8 million in fiscal 2015 driven by B2B scores and myFICO B2C revenues.Overall revenues in fiscal 2015 are expected to grow approximately $50 million to $840 million driven by the growth in the company's three segments, as mentioned above. Per our estimate, the company's share price is heading toward $93.50 based on 3.5x fiscal 2015 revenue.Potential Risks to the Investment PremiseFinal WordsThe growth drivers stated above are expected to boost FICO's top-line and earnings by the end of the current fiscal year.

The company operates with decent profit margins and returns on equity. Over the last decade the company’s profit margins have averaged around 12% and its return on equity has averaged around 20%.The company’s balance sheet shows that it operates with a fairly high level of debt. The long-term debt is currently $604 million representing 45% of its total asset value. The company’s total liabilities represent 81% of its total asset value, which has steadily increased from 54% over the last decade. These debt levels are higher than what I prefer, but the company still profitable and manages to produce a decent return on equity. I would personally prefer if this raising debt trend reversed or at least stopped climbing. As the debt levels rise so does the bankruptcy risk.The company also has a history of operating with declining working capital. Fair Isaac’s current ratio has dropped from 3.8 down to 0.8 over the last decade. At present the company’s short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) no longer cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay).Fair Isaac’s forward PE multiple is 46x with a stock price of $283. The company’s trailing PE multiple is 53x and its book value multiple is 33x. These multiples imply that Fair Isaac is expensive. The company has paid a small dividend in the past, with the last quarterly payment of $0.02 in March, 2017.Fair Isaac has a strong history of growth with its earnings increasing 15% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows Fair Isaac’s revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of estimates.Fair Isaac data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, Fair Isaac’s revenue has increased over the last decade and the forecasts show this trend continuing into the 2020/09 fiscal year. The earnings have broadly trended upwards over the last decade with a flat period during 2013/09 to 2015/09 fiscal years. The analysts are expecting Fair Isaac’s earnings growth to continue into the 2020/09 fiscal year.Fair Isaac produces its growth through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Over the last decade Fair Isaac has acquired 10 companies, with the latest acquisition in 2018 of GoOn LLC, a credit risk management consulting firm based in Brazil. Prior to this, in 2016 Fair Isaac acquired QuadMetrics, which uses predictive analytics to rate the security of companies.Fair Isaac’s management is open to more acquisitions, with Mike Pung – CFO, stating in the company’s latest earnings call:While acquisitions are an avenue the company uses to increase and/or improve their product offerings, Fair Isaac also has an active R&D team having spent $128 million in 2018 (which represented 12% of 2018 revenues). The R&D expenditure allows the company to develop new products as a means of boosting growth, with the Fair Isaac’s CEO, Will Lansing, stating:Falcon is a fraud managing software system used by financial institutions to reduce debit and credit card fraud losses. The company is releasing a cloud based version of Falcon. I think this is a good idea, as cloud-based systems are in demand by businesses, and if Fair Isaac doesn’t develop their own, then this leaves it open for a competitor to develop theirs and thereby take market share from Fair Isaac.Fair Isaac developed the cloud-based system in response to demand, with the CEO stating:Fair Isaac is also looking to improve its product offering by partnering with Equifax, with the CEO stating:Fair Isaac plans to use Equifax data with Fair Isaac’s decision management platform which will offer banks more consumer data with deeper analysis.The company’s revenue stream is largely recurring as their software systems are licensed with contracts, which includes system usage and maintenance. Recurring revenues represents around 75% of Fair Isaac’s revenue. Having a fairly high portion of recurring revenue helps cushion the year-to-year volatility that companies often experience.As a means of enhancing shareholder value, the company has repurchased shares, with the CEO stating: The company has reduced its shares outstanding over the last six months by 2% having spent $120 million. The remaining $80 million will further reduce the share count by another percent or so.Ordinarily I’m in favor of reducing the outstanding shares, but the company’s debt continues to rise and I would personally prefer if management used this to reduce debt. However, being a public company with investor relations to deal with, I suspect the share repurchases are primarily to keep investors happy – otherwise investors may take more notice of the company’s escalating debt.Overall, I think that Fair Isaac is a profitable company with strong growth potential, but I will keep an eye on their debt.Fair Isaac has a history of growth with its earnings increasing at an average rate of 15% per year over the last decade and the forecast growth rate is 15% heading into 2020. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 15% gives a forward PEG of around 3.1 with a 2020 PE multiple of 46x.It’s commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that Fair Isaac is overvalued with a stock price of $283. Its fair value would be around $90.A forward PEG of 3.1 is quite high, considering that many good growth stocks have forward PEG’s in the 1.5 to 2.5 range. Growth stocks typically have higher forwards PEG’s as investors are usually more willing to pay higher prices for future growth of companies that have an established history of producing earnings growth.As an active investor I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Fair Isaac chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade Fair Isaac’s stock price has trended higher over the last decade. The stock pulled back in 2018 as the stock market pulled back from its all-time high. After bottoming late in 2018 the stock rallied strongly along with the market and traded well past its 2018 peak.In the short-term the stock looks over bought. The stock has rallied 60% so far this year without a pullback. In order to sustain a rally the stock needs to rest and a 60% gain in three months is not sustainable. The surge in stock price typically entices profit takers to lock in their substantial gains which ultimately leads to a pullback.The stock may trade higher for a bit longer, but sooner or later the price advance will reverse with a pullback. After a pullback, I think that Fair Isaac will rally again and trade higher in line with its earnings growth potential.Fair Isaac is a profitable company, but its debt has risen steadily over the last decade and is starting to become quite significant. The company does have a solid history of growth and the analysts are expecting more growth going forward. To further drive growth, Fair Isaac has released a cloud version of its Falcon system and has partnered with Equifax to provide data for Fair Isaac’s decision management platform. The company has also been active on the acquisition front with 10 acquisitions over the last decade, with management remaining open to the idea of further acquisitions.The company has paid a small dividend in the past, but has not paid any since 2017. Fair Isaac has reduced its outstanding shares by 2% over the last six months, with further repurchases for the remaining of the current fiscal year.While Fair Isaac is a strong growth stock, it’s expensive with a forward PEG of 3.1 and a forward PE of 46x. The stock has rallied strongly this year with a 60% gain so far without a break. In the short-term, I think the stock has reached the stage where it’s overbought and due for a pullback.Based on Fair Isaac’s strong growth potential I think the stock could make a solid long-term investment at a lower price, but I would keep an eye on its rising debt. The stock is currently overbought and investors looking to buy now would need to be prepared for a likely pullback. For me, I’m on the sidelines as I think it’s too expensive at the moment."
3273535,63483,2015-06-22T03:46:13-04:00,"Data analytics firm primarily serving the banking industry.Resilient competitive advantage stems from customer switching costs and network effects.Macro tailwinds remain intact, FICO should continue to benefit from the current rate environment.Margin expansion should be minimal going forward, as the company continues investing in the cloud and on big data solutions.Minimal margin of safety at current levels; investors should wait for a pullback before going long the stock.","The businessFair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO) is a data analytics firm which focuses primarily on providing application software and other related services for the banking industry. In the current information age, banks and other lending institutions are increasingly relying on data analytics solutions in order to operate efficiently.Decades ago, things were much simple. A borrower comes into the bank and applies for a loan. A loan officer proceeds to assess the borrower's credit worthiness in order to determine whether adjustments need to be made to the initial terms, and then decides whether to approve or decline the loan. Suffice to say, this is extremely time-consuming and inefficient to do on a large scale.This is where FICO comes in.Most prominently, the company develops software in order to aid financial institutions to market and originate their loan offerings. Additionally, its solutions also allow clients to manage customer accounts more efficiently and also detect and prevent fraud. In other words, FICO's solutions are deeply embedded within its customers' work-flows. The firm's software applications does this automatically and hence solves the scaling problem.Besides the above, FICO also offers a service that is very familiar to most Americans who have taken out a loan before - credit scoring. The company develops these scores (300-850) based on third-party data (usually from the national credit reporting agencies), with the aim of objectively, consistently and accurately measuring an individual's credit risk. Furthermore, the firm also provides software development tools which allow financial institutions to create their own custom software to suit their needs.FICO makes the bulk of its cash from the licensing of its software applications - the company enters into long-term contracts and collects annual license and maintenance fees over the life of the contract. It also generates revenue through the use of its credit scoring system on a per transaction basis.Resilient competitive advantage stemming from customer switching costs and network effectsThe firm has been extremely successful with its scoring initiative, evident from the fact that nearly every major bank in the US (98 of the top 100) relies on FICO's credit scoring to make loans to the 200m+ American consumers whose data is reported to the national credit reporting agencies. This situation is similar on a global scale as well. It is this feature that forms the basis of FICO's competitive advantage.As more banks use FICO's credit scores to make loans, consumers are effectively forced to focus on their individual credit scores in order to qualify for a loan. With each incremental consumer added, the firm's data sets become slightly more robust. This produces a network effect. As more banks and consumers are added to the network, the network becomes more valuable to existing participants (mostly the banks).As a result, customer switching costs are extremely high. For nearly every financial institution, it does not make economic sense for them to switch to an alternate software provider as FICO's credit scoring system is the industry standard. Said another way, it is the system consumers and banks are used to and have been utilizing for many years. Thus, there is little reason to switch to a new system. Due to this, I opine that FICO is likely able to derive a certain degree of pricing power over the long term. After all, there is a tremendous benefit (operating efficiency) to using the FICO's credit scoring system and applications, and little reason not to.In a nutshell, we have a business that:If I ask you to describe a great business to me, it is very likely that you would mention one or more of the points listed above. One bone of contention a prospective investor might have is that such a business is highly sensitive to cyclicality. Hence, I would not recommend FICO as a core position to a conservative investor.Of course, qualitative discussion is all well and good, but it must be supported by the numbers. In this case, the numbers do indeed support the narrative. The firm's competitive advantages manifest themselves in its EBITDA margins, which have been consistently greater than 20% year after year. 67% of the company's revenues are derived from recurring sources (i.e. transactional fees and software maintenance fees) as of FY14. Considering the stability of FICO's EBITDA margins, it is safe to assume that the company possesses a fair degree of pricing power.Macro tailwinds remain intact, FICO should continue to benefit from the current rate environmentBeing a software and service provider to the banking industry, the company's fortune depends largely on the health of the economy and the demand for credit. Considering the fact that macro tailwinds remain intact, FICO should continue to benefit in the near term. Although interest rates have been rising due to the recent bond sell-off, consumer borrowing in the US remains firm. Despite the fact that interest rates have been inching up, they are still extremely depressed compared to historic levels. The Fed has made it quite clear that a rate hike is unlikely this year.Even in the event of a rate hike, prominent economists have postulated that the increase in interest rates is likely to be a gradual one. As a result, the demand for credit should remain quite strong going forward. As FICO derives its revenues from the use of its credit scoring system and software applications, the company is without a doubt a significant beneficiary of these tailwinds.Margin expansion should be minimal going forward, as the company continues investing in the cloud and on big data solutionsCurrently, businesses globally are exposed to secular trends such as big data and the cloud. These trends are likely to revolutionize the ways companies operate. FICO clearly aims to capitalize on these trends; the company has been investing heavily in deploying its solutions on the cloud and developing big data solutions to further augment the value-add of its software applications. The company has made good progress on migrating to the cloud (though it still offers traditional on-premise software). This is evident from the fact that most of the company's applications are available through a SaaS-based model. I expect the company to continue allocating capital to the development, expansion and refinement of its cloud and big data offerings. Due to increased investment required to pull this off, I expect margins to come under pressure in the near term and expand slightly going forward.Minimal margin of safety at current levels; investors should wait for a pullback before going long the stockAs seen above, revenue growth is projected to come in at mid single-digits throughout the 5-year projection period. Not only are these assumptions in line with the company's historical growth rates, they are also supported by the fact that the company has achieved quite a sizable amount of market penetration globally. In other words, double-digit top-line growth would be quite hard to achieve going forward.EBITDA margins are expected to decrease to 23% through FY16, as the company experiences margin pressure as a result of its increased investment in developing and expanding its cloud and big data offerings. This increased investment is likely to be slightly offset by the incremental revenues generated by these new offerings, hence margins should experience a net contraction during the aforementioned period. Beyond FY17, margins are projected to gradually expand to 26%, as the company begins achieving scale on its new offerings.My model implies a price target of $82.50 (assuming 15x EV/LTM EBITDA and a 10% discount rate), and minimal margin of safety at current levels. Investors who are looking for a cyclical play to add to their current portfolio are advised to wait for a significant pullback before going long the stock. Conservative investors should also heed this advice, but should also consider allocating lesser capital in order to mitigate unwanted portfolio volatility."
2464275,57741,2014-09-02T04:24:43-04:00,,"By Cameron DanielsMuch has been written about the recent change in the FICO scoring system from both mainstream media and personal finance blogosphere.Using my compelling inside information and incredible subject matter expertise, I can insist that it will not make much of a difference.What? Huh?First, a little background. Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) is a publicly traded company (trading under, intelligently, the ticker symbol FICO) that sells credit scores to companies.Meet the new credit worthiness! Same as the old credit worthiness!Credit Bureaus (the major three of which are Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY), TransUnion and Equifax (NYSE:EFX)) are also publicly traded companies that keep information that they provide to companies. What is their product? They sell information about you provided by some banks to other banks so that other banks can intelligibly determine whether to extend a line of credit to you.Understand this: they are not government entities. Credit bureaus are publicly traded companies trying to make a profit using you as the product. Companies often use FICO (a product of Fair Isaac, remember) in conjunction with the scores provided by the bureaus themselves and their own internal, proprietary models to either determine your rate or to make decisions on whether they are willing to extend credit.Get That? FICO is a Product SOLD to Banks and other InstitutionsEvery few years, Fair Isaac comes out with a rehash of their FICO credit scoring model. It is very often a very similar (to older products) tweaking of the variables that determine creditworthiness. For example, in a new model versus an older model, adding an inquiry to your record might cause your FICO to drop 2 points instead of 1.8. To the average consumer, this is 100% meaningless. The core tenets of personal financial discipline remain the same:The Obvious ConclusionThat's right: I just wanted to iterate that Fair Isaac themselves have a very obvious incentive to overplay the differences between versions of their models… marketing. Convincing people that the newest model is vastly superior to the old models makes banks want to change the version of the FICO product they purchase and license!Banks can still purchase an older FICO model for cheaper and the more FICO overplays the changes, the more they are able to sell the product at a heightened price (Brand New! Up to date credit scoring system! Now for only $9.99!).The takeaway: not much has changed and it still does not mean much (if anything at all) to the end consumer. Think about that the next time you see a blog talking about the huge benefits of the 'new credit scoring model' - it's the same as talking about any other new product, except for the fact that consumers aren't the ones buying it.They are… in a way… the ones selling it."
1902301,24377,2013-12-17T08:15:29-05:00,,"An often forgotten contributor to the financial crisis is a company called Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO), or better known as FICO. FICO Scores are part of the Scores department; these scores are the familiar retail credit scores, graded on a scale of 300 - 800, that provide consumers a credit rating to obtain financing for mortgages and credit cards. This unit provides 26% of the revenue for FICO while contributing 45% to the total operating income for Fair Isaac. I propose that FICO stock is being undervalued due to the antithetical operating results of their three business segments, Applications, Tools, and Scores. FICO is worth considerably more than the current price of $57.00 ($1.97B) due to possible catalysts of increased earnings power and the potential for a spin-off of the Scores Unit. A spin-off of the Scores Unit would likely realize a higher multiple for each of the new operating entities as the market is currently valuing large-moat market leaders with 25x to 30x P/E and the remaining Applications and Tools Units (Essentially a software company) with double-digit growth would also see 20x to 25x P/E. Each unit will also be able to optimize their capital structure to better reflect the capital return methods each of the new entities should embrace.The Scores Unit (SU) would greatly benefit from a spin-off as they earn outsized returns with minimal capital investment requirements which would allow the unit to consistently support a large payout ratio. The SU has an incredibly power brand name, network effects as consumers have limited trust for credit scores which leads to every bank required to provide an independent and trusted credit score. With patent protection and the robustness of FICO's research team compared to the size of the nearest competitor, the technological advantage which is the cost to duplicate FICO's software is vastly greater than the $825mm of Goodwill and Intangible assets listed on the balance sheet. Warren Buffett (NYSE:BRK.A) lectures that a high tangible assets to pre-tax operating income will ultimately lead to outsize returns as these types of companies generally have pricing power and the ability to return a significant amount of excess cash. The Scores company of FICO is the best or a better example than even See's Candy of a small company with an incredible moat and large ROE that is fairly valued with stocks at an all-time high. The SU generated $129.0mm (46.8% of FICO) in operating income off $180.8mm in revenue (24% of FICO) for a gross margin of 71% (which has expanded from 70% and 67% in 2012 and 2011, respectively). Even though they face customer risk with ""Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, collectively accounted for approximately 16%, 18% and 18%"", I feel these companies exist as an oligopoly where if any would fail the other two would pick up the slack of a new entity would replace them. The overall revenue stream for the SU is more dependent on consumers increasing their demand to borrow which leads to an exponentially larger amount of credit score requests which lead to royalties for the SU. Given FICO's -$70mm ""unallocated corporate expenses"" charge against all 3 segments reported operating incomes, I assign the charge proportionally across each unit. Therefore, the SU would report $95.7mm in operating income for 2013 with past growth rates in the high single digits annually over nearly any significant time period. The SU would see FCF and Owner's Earnings which are greater than the $95.7mm in operating income due to the structure of the company, which we can estimate at ~$110mm. At a 35% corporate tax rate, we can estimate the SU's 2013 net income at $71.5mm and growing perpetually at 8%. This would imply a market capitalization of $1.79B to $2.15B at 25x to 30x P/E that still has potential to surprise due to the SU being highly leverage to a housing recovery that can help offset the current deleveraging of the consumer, which will ultimately help the SU in the long-run. This means the SU currently represents the entire market capitalization of FICO and you are getting a Software unit that's both profitable and growing at 15% - 25% over the past two years for free!What I term as the 'Software Co' (SC) is merely the remaining units of FICO, Applications and Tools (A&T). I would imagine a spin-off of the SU would mean the FICO name would go with them and the Applications and Tools Units would be renamed. Although SC would no longer benefit from the cross sales opportunities provided to them by the SU, I feel that the products of the A&T units are mature enough in the market to survive and thrive without the benefit of the SU. A Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on SEP-13-2013 provides us with a breakdown of the leading products for the A&T units which you can see here. You can see that FICO A&T has a favorable mix of products with lower market share in some of the larger market sizes which provides a greater potential for growth as FICO A&T has a market lead in two very fragmented Sub-Segments, Fraud and Customer Management, and they are one of the few companies that provides the suite of products which allows customers purchasing the software to get everything they need from the same company. This saves time on training and costs on support for the customer and gives FICO A&T the potential to continue their current cross-selling opportunities at similar ratios to today. FICO A&T would also be valued at a premium to competitors given their market leads in multiple sub-products. Since FICO A&T's reported growth of 11% to 12% over the past 2 years is larger than the market growth for each sub-segment, it stands to reason that FICO A&T's market share is expanding in at least one of the sub-segments substantially or, more likely, that they are gaining share in most of the sub-segments below. As they move towards #1 in each of the below categories, cross-selling becomes easier and easier, allowing for the possibility of revenue measured in the billions in the near future. Currently, A&T accounts for $562.6mm (76% of FICO) and operating profit of ~$105mm after taking a proportional charge for ""Unallocated corporate expenses"". FCF and Owner Earnings would likely approximate net income for A&T, which means a 35% corporate tax rate would lead to net income of $68.25mm and a possible market capitalization of $1.02B (15x P/E) to $1.71B (25x P/E). Not bad for a free operating unit!Thus far, the most important assumption we have made is that multiple expansion will occur for the P/E ratio due to market comps being higher than the current 19.5 P/E for TTM (15.83 P/E = $57/$3.60 based on recent quarterly results). By my 'back-of-the-envelope' calculations above, FICO's total intrinsic value is likely in the range of $2.81B to $3.86B. This means there is potential for share appreciation of 42.6% to 96.0%. Couple that share appreciation just to reach intrinsic value with the consistent 12% - 18% ROE that have been posted over decades and you have a long-term buy that has potential to provide excess returns beyond the S&P 500 even after the significant rally in FICO shares over the past 3 years. Also, the SU would have the capacity to return $50mm in dividends annually if spun-off. If the SU was spun-off 1 share for each FICO share (34.57mm shares outstanding), then the SU would be able to return $1.45 in dividends annually with copious availability in the payout ratio and earnings grow to become a dividend grower. This would be a 2.5% yield at current prices and an even higher yield considering the SU would trade lower immediately after the spin-off then FICO as a whole.I hope management investigates the possibilities of spinning off FICO just as Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) did with Moody's (MCO) in 2000. FICO today is actually in a very similar position to D&B, whose software for corporate information could be cross-sold with the Moody's credit scores but, each was able to operate successfully by themselves and Moody's was finally able to pass their excess returns on to shareholders more easily by not being weighed down by other companies that lacked their competitive-advantage. FICO has been my longest holding in my personal account at well over 2 years (Since Day 1) without selling a single share. Being able to hold with confidence, even with large unrealized profits, is what has driven my returns higher since I can continue to defer taxes, gaining the interest on the deferred amount, and having my money tied up efficiently (with high expected returns) decreases transaction costs or frictional costs. The result has been 40%+ annualized returns over the past two years (sadly, without BOFI contributing its tremendous rally). Obviously, as I mentioned in my results article, these returns are somewhat buoyed by the increase in the S&P 500 and some luck. However, I feel confident that picking strong operating companies with a competitive-advantage, competent management, and a history of stable growing earnings will lead to returns that beat most indexes. This information is not a secret, as Warren Buffett preaches this endlessly. May this article serve as a reminder that buy-and-hold is not dead and situations/companies like FICO are what provides alpha.Disclosure: I am long FICO, MCO, BRK.B. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2456875,24377,2014-08-28T07:41:07-04:00,Immediate Catalysts to realize projected valuation with recently announced $250mm buyback for 14% of the company.Conservatively valued at $2.85B vs. current market cap of $1.85B ($57.10).Stock has potential to appreciate 54% before buybacks and up to 64% adjusted for buybacks!A spin-off of the Credit Scores Unit would give investors a pure-play investment opportunity in a See's Candy like Business.Original investors in 1987 have seen their investment increase by 37x or 3700%!,"Although the stock has barely moved since I projected it could double in my last article, Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is still one of the widest moat companies that is publicly traded; they are the creator of the ubiquitous retail credit score which has the company namesake of FICO, and is immaculately run (as I will describe below). Unscathed from the financial crisis, Fair Isaac Corporation has a string of excellent news of late; they just launched a $250mm buyback program (representing 14% of the company!), revenue grew 10% (with software growing at 12-14%, which is the key to future profit growth), and there is always the potential that FICO spins-off their Credit Scores unit to unlock additional shareholder value.FICO Scores is part of the Scores Unit for reporting purposes and provides 26% of the revenue for FICO while contributing 45% to the total operating income for Fair Isaac. With one of the widest moats of any operating company in America and a product as well-known as Michael Jordan or the United States flag internationally, FICO scores displays their pricing power and economic advantage in each annual report. Although revenue in the unit (and the company as a whole) is fairly volatile with unit revenue still below all-time highs in 2006, the whole companies' revenue is highly correlated housing and consumer GDP which makes FICO a Warren Buffett-type bet on American economic recovery. Others have mentioned the historically choppy revenue and earnings as a reason this wouldn't be a company Warren Buffett would be interested in, but if you considered USG, Moody's, BNSF at the time of his first stock purchase, and numerous other companies who have strong business operations but whose operations are levered to certain parts of the economy, preventing them from reporting smooth and steadily increasing earnings. I believe FICO's intrinsic value and earnings power has likely increased at a higher than market rate over a relatively long-term time period. FICO has the #1 or #2 market share in each of their software application categories (See my previous article) and FICO scores has a 96%+ market share for retail credit scores and has held this nearly unthinkable monopoly for almost 3 decades; their long-term stock chart should make any investor drool at the results.FICO data by YChartsI propose that FICO stock is being undervalued due to the antithetical operating results of their three business segments, Applications, Tools, and Scores. FICO is worth considerably more than the current price of $57.10 ($1.97B) due to possible catalysts: 1) higher revenue due to increased earnings power since the consumer credit peak of 2006; and 2) the potential for a spin-off of the Scores Unit into an independently traded company since it is my estimation that it would receive a perennial earnings multiplier premium due to the highly consistent increase in earnings. Each unit will also be able to optimize their capital structure to better reflect the capital return realities as the scores unit could buyback shares or payout a large dividend (or some combination of both) as very little incremental invested capital is necessary to increase profits. FICO's dichotomy would result in the Tools & Apps units (all their software) to reinvest 100% of their profits to continue to increase their market shares in the highly fragmented categories they compete in. This would allow FICO's software to grow at a faster rate than the current one and would help it get to the 15 - 20%+ ROE clip and meet its earnings potential.A summary of Yahoo Finance's description of FICO's business:The Scores Unit [SU] would greatly benefit from a spin-off as they earn outsized returns with minimal incremental capital investment, allowing the unit to support a large payout ratio, whether through buybacks or dividends, in a hypothetical spin-off scenario. The SU has an incredibly powerful brand name and network effects as consumers have limited trust for competing credit scores, which has led to 97 of the top 100 banks providing and using FICO scores to evaluate credit risk. This incredible market penetration is protected with their numerous patents and the robustness of FICO's research team compared to all competitors.FICO's technological advantage over its competitors, which is the cost to duplicate FICO's software, scores, and reputation, is vastly greater than the $825mm of Goodwill and Intangible assets listed on the balance sheet. Any incoming competitors would likely need well over the $1.85B market cap to take a 96% market share internationally for retail credit (and probably $10 - $25B through research or mind share). Warren Buffett lectures investors to look for high returns from tangible assets as they will ultimately lead to outsized equity returns.Companies with competitive advantages like FICO generally have pricing power (as FICO Scores displays) and the ability to return a significant amount of excess cash in a prudent manner. Historical buyback programs have been highly successful. The Scores company of FICO is the best example of a modern See's Candy I can find with an incredible moat and large ROE that is fairly valued, we just have to push management to spin it off as soon as possible! The SU generated $129.0mm (46.8% of FICO) in operating income from $180.8mm in revenue (24% of FICO) for an EBIT margin of 71% (which has expanded from 70% and 67% in 2012 and 2011, respectively). Even though they face customer risk with the annual report stating that ""…Equifax, TransUnion and Experian, collectively accounted for approximately 16%, 18% and 18%..."", I feel these companies exist as an oligopoly where if any would fail the other two would pick up the slack or a new entity would replace them. The overall revenue stream for the SU is more dependent on consumers increasing their demand to borrow (mortgage debt level is a good approximation) which leads to an exponentially larger amount of credit score requests which in turn lead to sales for the SU.To more accurately calculate pro-forma operating income for each unit after a hypothetical spin-off we must consider FICO's -$70mm ""unallocated corporate expenses"" charge against all 3 segments reported operating incomes. I assign the charge proportionally across each unit, therefore the SU would report $95.7mm in operating income for 2013 with past growth rates in the high single digits annually over nearly any significant time period. The SU would see FCF and Owner's Earnings which are greater than the $95.7mm in operating income due to the structure of the company, which we can estimate at ~$110mm. At a 35% corporate tax rate, we can estimate the SU's 2013 net income at $71.5mm and growing perpetually at 8%. 10x Operating income implies Warren Buffett would purchase at $1.1B and 20x - 25x NI for a very strong company implies valuations of $1.42 - $1.78B for the credit scores unit alone. Due to a lack of robust stock coverage by sell-side investment analysts compared to similarly sized and traded stocks is resulting in the mispricing FICO minus the SU, or T&A (Tools & Apps/Software) Unit with a very conservative valuation of $750mm or a more likely implied value of $70mm - $430mm if you believe the stand-alone credit scores company would trade at Moody's/S&P valuations. Good news for investors is that at the current price of $57.10, SU currently represents nearly the entire market capitalization of FICO so you are getting a Software unit with $560mm in revenue, conservatively-adjusted EBIT of $95mm (17% margin), and growing top-line at 10% - 15% for years for $70mm! Valuing T&A at 10x EBIT gives a $950mm plus SU value of $1.78B gives total value of $2.75B and a margin of safety of 33% for a strong monopoly. This is truly how alpha is found in investing.The recently announced buyback program of $250mm, effective immediately, represents 4,378,284 shares at an average price of $57.10, leaving just 30.408mm shares outstanding after exhausting the buyback program. FICO has already repurchased 57.071mm shares in the history of the program out of a total 88.857mm shares issued in total. Yes, they really have repurchased 60.85% of the company in about 2 decades. Much like investors of AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or the types of companies Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) purchases, an initial equity stake of 1% in the company would now represent a 2.5% position, assuming an investor purchased at a time when there were 88mm+ shares outstanding, due to the effects of the share buybacks. Not only do investors receive fantastic share appreciation they also own a larger share of the pie for future earnings. Forget millions in net worth, investing in the FICO's of the world at current valuation is how an individual retail investor can make BILLIONS! Returning a compounded 20% will do such things for an individual.Thus far, the most important assumption we have made is that multiple expansion will occur for the P/E ratio due to market comps being higher than the current 19.5 P/E for TTM (15.83 P/E = $57/$3.60 based on recent quarterly results). By my 'back-of-the-envelope' calculations above, FICO's total intrinsic value is most likely in a range around an average value of $2.85B. This means there is potential for share appreciation of 54.1%. Couple that share appreciation just to reach intrinsic value with the consistent 12% - 18% ROE that have been posted over decades and you have a long-term buy that has expected excess returns relative to the S&P 500 even after the significant rally in FICO shares over the past 3 years. Assume the buyback occurs at an average price of $57.10, we now have 30.408mm shares which gives an intrinsic value per share of $93.73. True potential appreciation to discounted fair value is 64.1%!I hope management investigates the possibilities of spinning off FICO just as Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DB) did with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in 2000. FICO today is actually in a very similar position to D&B in 1999/2000, whose software for corporate information could be cross-sold with the Moody's credit scores but, each was able to operate (more) successfully by themselves as Moody's has finally been able to pass their excess returns on to shareholders more easily by no longer being connected to other companies that lacked their competitive-advantage. FICO has long been a holding in my personal account and I've never sold a single share. I haven't bought recently as my cost basis is ~$20 but for the first time in years FICO is one of my best ideas for investment along with a micro-cap I've been unable to write about called Eldorado Artesian Springs (OTCPK:ELDO). I've recently posted about ELDO and a lengthy conversation has begun at Corner of Berkshire and Fairfax.A note about my personal results and current investment strategy, I believe being able to hold with confidence, even with large unrealized profits, is what has helped to drive incrementally higher returns since I can continue to defer taxes, gaining the interest on the deferred amount with a positive incremental economic return of 90% * deferred amount (10% or long-term CG tax-rate * capital gains), and having my money tied up efficiently due to expected returns providing alpha as well as a decrease in transaction or frictional costs. The result has been 44.3% annualized returns over the past three years (Before FICO, I've never before promoted a company I've owned). Obviously, as I mentioned in my results article, past returns have likely been buoyed by the large increase in the S&P 500 and some luck; however, given returns thus far, I am even more hopeful for outsized future returns since I believe my portfolio would be more likely to beat a down market than an up market and by a great margin. My portfolio is generally highly concentrated, very conservative, and has a low correlation to the S&P 500.Similar to Warren Buffett's claim, I believe I am capable of returning at least 30% annually by buying companies like FICO. An investor with the goals of growing intrinsic value of their portfolio faster than the overall market with less ""risk"" (not necessarily beta) than the benchmark would logically lead that investor to a strategy of growth-at-fair-value strategy, somewhere between Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, where someone owns a small basket of 1 - 10 stocks of companies with a long history of strong operating results that show both signs of a competitive-advantage high margins and a qualitative evaluation of the business model that would predict the excellent operating results. These companies should also have competent management and a low percentage of permanent impairment of initial invested capital. This information is not a secret, as Warren Buffett preaches this strategy endlessly with outstanding results yet investors continue to ignore him. May this article serve as a reminder that buy-and-hold is not dead and situations/companies like FICO currently can provide alpha even with the markets at or near all-time highs.Income Statement:Balance Sheet:Cash-Flow Statement:Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3996741,48501,2016-08-06T11:45:08-04:00,FICO open access drives revenue growth.Decreased usage of outside service providers improves profitability.Affinity and FICO XD could provide upside surprises.,"Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) reported a solid FQ3 just over a week ago and upped its full-year guidance for GAAP net income and GAAP EPS. The updated guidance is a bit on the conservative side as it is substantially below the company's run rate for FY16. While there is a significant part of the business that is transactional and thus difficult to forecast accurately, the increase in recurring revenues provides some stability to the top line; with that stated, I see FICO topping sales guidance by $24 million and beating on the net income number by $17 million. That in and of itself should lead to a pop in the share price after the company reports, but FY17 guidance will be a significant contributing factor to post-report share price performance. If management guides above 3-4% sales growth for FY17, the share price could see a nice rally.FICO provides consumers with access to their credit score, which is the number taken into consideration by 90% of lenders; the Scores business is growing at a double-digit pace as financial institutions partner with FICO to provide consumers with easier access to their credit score and the report detailing how the score is derived. FICO is also a provider of software, including FICO Decision Management Suite and FICO Enterprise Fraud Management. Applications represents just over 60% of the business, with Scores representing 25% and the remainder coming from the Tools business.As we head into FY17, the Scores business is expected to continue to be a growth driver with the addition of clients such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The Applications business is expected to continue to be a steady grower, growing in the mid-single digits; Tools, which is highlighted by DMS, is showing positive signs as the uptake of the Decision Management Suite has been solid. There are a couple areas of potential upside surprises in FY17; FICO XD, which provides credit scores to consumers who were previously without a credit score, could see significant uptake, and the Affinity business, which was expected to see uptake in FY16, could close significant deals in FY17.Given the improvement in profitability during FY16 and a FY16 forward GAAP P/E of about 32, I think that FICO could see 16% upside from here to the end of FY17. The value of FICO is 34x FY17 GAAP EPS of $4.40 or $149.60, a slight premium to the Nasdaq (33.8x). There should be limited downside risk on the back of relatively low multiplies and solid revenue growth.Steady Growth And Improving ProfitsFICO is a steady grower with improving profitability. During FY2016, FICO lowered its cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue by decreasing the use of third-party services and by winning business in higher margin software. Over the next five quarters, I expect FICO to continue to grow because of FICO Open Access, Decision Management Suite (DMS), and fraud and compliance solutions sales.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingFICO Open Access is a new business model for the company and it provides individuals with access to their FICO score and a report detailing how the score is derived. For example, you can go onto the Discover website and obtain your FICO score as well as a report about your score. FICO the company generates revenue from these scores; that revenue is a key contributor to the growth of revenue from the transactional and maintenance category. Additionally, FICO is adding score vendors, such as Bank of America, which will be accretive to revenues going forward.For FY2016, I'm anticipating 6% total revenue growth, with a 12% increase in gross profit as cost of goods sold declines. Improved profitability is expected to result in a 34% increase in operating income and a 35% increase in net income with EPS of $3.90. The total revenue and net income forecasts are above management's guidance as it appears that leadership is guiding conservatively. For FY2017, I'm looking for 4% total revenue growth, with 6% net income growth and EPS of $4.40. The recent authorization of a $250M share repurchase program should augment FY2017 EPS.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingTurning to the balance sheet, the two items that are noteworthy are management's willingness to make acquisitions and the level of debt. Goodwill, which is the purchase price of a company over its net asset value, was about two-thirds of total assets at the end of fiscal Q3; cash, accounts receivable and goodwill are the major components of total assets. In terms of debt, the company has restrictive debt covenants that guide to a net debt to EBITDA ratio below 3; I'm expecting the ratio to be 2.18 at the end of the FY and 1.81 at the end of FY17.Courtesy of Morningstar and Bottom Up InvestingThe cash flow statement tells a story of solid cash flow generated from operations and relatively minimal usage of cash for capital expenditures. With that stated, the company uses its cash flow from operations to make smaller acquisitions of technology that improve its offerings. Management may use some of the cash flow from operations to pay down debt in the coming fiscal year. The other noteworthy item is the $250M authorization for share repurchases.ValuationI see 16% upside to the share price based on my forecast for FY2017 EPS. With the Nasdaq trading at 33x trailing EPS and the Russell 2000 trading at 42x EPS, the conservative value of FICO's shares is 34x EPS, a slight premium to the Nasdaq. The forecasted EPS is partly based on the assumption that management continues the decreased usage of outside service providers with the corresponding impact of improved profitability. EPS is forecasted to increase 13% in FY2017.Courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingAdditionally, while a significant amount of good news is already priced, I think the continued success of FICO Open Access has yet to be priced by the market. Additionally, harder to model new opportunities such as FICO XD and Affinity could provide significant upside to sales and earnings and consequently the market value of the company. Overall, there is substantial upside potential and limited downside risk."
4208014,104739,2018-09-25T09:30:00-04:00,"Fair Isaac is a dominant player in the credit ecosystem in the United States.Over 90% of all credit decisions and 98% of all mortgages written in the United States.Beyond the credit scoring business, which generates the largest component of operating profits, the company offers a suite of analytics software.The company trades on a forward free cash flow yield of c. 3% with the potential to grow earnings at mid-single digit rates with minimal investment requirements.A prodigious stock-buyback program has enabled company to retire around half its share count in the last decade.","The renowned FICO score effectively determines a citizen's propensity to repay a piece of debt. This is achieved by analysing the person's underlying credit report, which is maintained by the principal credit reporting agencies in the United States. Fair Isaac does not aggregate underlying credit data, rather it derives analytical insights from an array of data to formulate a credit scorecard. The company has been the market leader since its inception 28 years ago. The company has many attractive characteristics: high, stable returns on capital, strong cash generation, and a long track record of returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. In the shorter term, there is under-appreciated upside to the earnings power of the business, thanks to a deal with Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY) and an upturn in the Scores division.Like the credit bureaus themselves, FICO's business model allows it to monetise the same data (or in FICO's case the same algorithms) multiple times. As a result, the company's return on capital and margin structure are very attractive: EBITDA margins and ROIC close to 30%. The company also has outstanding cash conversion characteristics, converting almost exactly 100% of operating profit into operating free cash flow over the past 15 years.Although FICO is exposed to the credit cycle (particularly in the US), its business model confers significant stability in terms of cash generation. Transactional, recurring revenue accounts for c. 70% of total sales. During the financial crisis, even as credit origination crashed and banks pulled back on discretionary technology spending, the company was able to maintain non-GAAP operating margins of c. 23%, a decline of only c. 300 bps at the trough.Such stability partly reflects FICO's high barriers to entry. Although it should, in theory, be possible for another company to develop competing algorithms (and many have tried), the reality has proven somewhat different. The credit bureaus themselves - arguably the best positioned potential competitors - tried for some years to muscle in on FICO's turf through the Vantage score. Ref: ForbesHowever, Vantage has failed to gain meaningful traction and Experian's deal to offer FICO scores on its websites in 2014 represents a pragmatic step to reflect FICO's continued dominance.In-house risk management tools have likewise been used to enhance, rather than replace, the FICO score. Whilst the score is rarely the only input in a lending decision, it tends to be deeply embedded in the processes of the lenders. The FICO score forms an important component of the risk management process - one that continues to be used even when parallel and/or complementary risk management tools have been developed.FICO's business is categorised under three operating segments:ScoresThe Scores segment provides business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) scoring solutions and services. The scoring is distributed through major credit reporting agencies worldwide, as well as to clients directly. The company is best known for its credit score: a figure (or set of figures) generated by the company's proprietary algorithms from data provided by the credit bureaus' extensive databases. The resultant score is used by financial and other institutions (insurers, retailers, telecoms providers, automotive companies, pharmaceutical makers, healthcare reorganisations and public agencies) - which pay a small amount on a per score basis - to help inform lending decisions as a measure of consumers' creditworthiness. The FICO Score is a three-digit score ranging from 300-850. It is calculated by running data from the three US national credit reporting agencies - Experian, TransUnion and Equifax though one of several proprietary scoring models developed by FICO. In addition to fees derived from lenders and users of the data, the credit reporting agencies pay an associate fee to FICO.Individuals have more than one FICO Score and are evaluated by lenders using different FICO Score versions. Auto lenders, for instance, often use FICO® Auto Scores, an industry-specific FICO Score version tailored to their needs. Credit card issuers use FICO® Bankcard Scores or FICO® Score 8.A credit score can be pulled for a number of reasons - screening, marketing or account management purposes comprise around 80% of the Scores' revenue. These scores may be lower priced, on average c. $0.01 per score, whereas scores used for credit card origination decisions might be priced at $0.05 per score - still a relatively low cost for a user. Markets like Autos (between 5-7% of B2B sales) and Housing (representing 10-15%) are important, but credit cards still represent by far the majority of the business. Scores of the more generic variety, used for marketing, screening or account management purposes, are typically lower priced. Credit origination scores, on the other hand, are more focused and priced at a multiple of other scores. The Scores products are sold through reseller channels which pay a royalty fee as they re-sell back to the end-customer. As a result of the royalty schedule, distribution is straightforward with very minimal cost of goods associated with revenues.FICO has become the de facto personal credit score provider. Regulators, pushing for greater transparency and consistency, encourage the use of the one product that best achieves this: the FICO score. As a consequence, the company's market share is enviable: it enjoys over 90% share of the B2B scores market and counts 98 of the top 100 US financial institutions as well as 75% of the biggest financial institutions globally among its customers. FICO is, in effect, a high margin toll road on the vast majority of major personal credit decisions made in the US. Ref: Fair IsaacWhilst the Scores business has been lacklustre during the ensuing recovery period following the Financial Crisis, reflecting a sluggish coverall credit environment in the US, consumers' willingness to spend on credit started to pick up in 2015. This has enabled FICO's Scores business to return to top-line growth over the past three years. Indeed, FICO scores volume peaked at 14.5 billion pre-crisis, before reaching a nadir of 9 billion in 2009-10. Last year volumes staged a robust recovery at around 13.8 billion - yet are still almost 10% below the previous peak.Close to 100% of incremental revenue growth - particularly where it is price-driven - drops-through to operating income - reflecting the negligible incremental cost associated with generating additional scores or enacting price changes. Hence, small increases in sales can have a disproportionate impact on profit. Management have pushed through fee increases for mortgage scores, which had been previously priced in line with credit card origination scores, despite the fact a mortgage is a materially higher value product. Prior to the price hikes mortgages only accounted for around 10% of FICO's B2B revenues with credit cards accounting for c.80% of segment sales.In FY2018 the Scores business is set to account for two-thirds of group profitability. Over the past three years, the business has experienced a step-change and prospects for future growth remain compelling.In addition to licensing scores to lending institutions through the credit reporting agencies, Fair Isaac monetises its IP by providing information about credit ratings to consumers themselves. However, FICO's dominance of the B2B Scores business is not matched by its position in this B2C segment: against its 90% market share of B2B, it currently has less than 5% of consumer business. However, this situation is evolving.There are two recent and powerful indications of FICO's increasing relevance in the consumer niche. The first is the Open Access program, initiated in 2013, which allowed banks and other organisations to provide FICO scores, previously used for risk management, directly to consumers for no incremental cost. This benefits the banks (since they are able to offer value-added information to their customers) but also benefits FICO through further reinforcement of its position - in the mind of both the bank and the consumer - as the default credit score in the US. In its push for consistency and transparency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has actively encouraged lenders to adopt the Open Access program.The second and potentially more immediately lucrative change is the deal signed with Experian in 2014, which was facilitated by the Open Access program. As a result of the deal, Experian was permitted to use FICO scores on its consumer-facing website in lieu of paying a royalty. Experian now provides FICO-branded scores direct on its own consumer sites (B2C) included in its bundled credit information service offered to consumers on the Experian site. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed by either party, but FICO receives a monthly fee for each customer that is paying Experian for its scores. Both companies have been encouraged by the early trends and the level of growth being achieved in FICO's B2C division has exploded. The deal also catalysed a range of collaborative agreements that have further expanded FICO's B2C reach. Importantly, the move by Experian represented an admission that FICO's eco-system brand proposition in the Scores segment was insurmountable. Subsequently, FICO signed other affinity and re-seller agreements, recently with American Express. FICO and Experian also expanded their own agreement to include lead generation. B2C now contributes 35% of Scores revenue versus 20% five years ago.Whilst FICO is best known for its Scores product, this is not the only string to its bow. Over the past decade, its Applications business, in particular, has become a more material part of the company: it now accounts for just over half of the Group's EBIT. The group's software offerings are dominated by two products, Falcon and Triad, focused on fraud and customer management respectively. These well-established products account for around 50% of the Apps revenue base and generate attractive operating margins.There are several companies that sell credit scores, and each of the three major credit bureaus has its own version of the credit score. Plus, the major credit bureaus collaborated and came up with their own brand of credit score, the Vantage Score. The FICO score is arguably the most well-known credit score. A FAKO score is a term that refers to any credit score that is not a FICO score. FAKO scores are for educational purposes only and do not reflect the scores that lenders use to approve your applications. A FICO score purchased online may not be identical to the one a lender uses because there are different versions of the FICO score for various industries and segments, as well as previous versions introduced in the past.The Vantage Score gives different weights to credit report information. Since each company's exact formula is unavailable, it is difficult to pinpoint the specific differences. Creditors and lenders use the credit score from the company they have a business relationship with. It could be a credit bureau's credit score, the FICO score, or the lender's own credit score.FICO is considered to be the gold standard for credit scoring and risk analytics with over 90% market share for retail credit scores where it has retained leadership for three decades. The company regularly updates its scoring algorithms to include more factors and to improve probabilistic forecasting. Its tools are generally considered simpler and easier to use for clients without advanced quantitative departments. The deep integration of FICO scores and products into companies' operations has raised switching costs, and with the brand recognition of the FICO score, we believe the company has established a strong and sustainable competitive advantage. Within software analytics and tools, FICO occupies either the number one or two position in each of their respective software application categories.FICO trades on a forward FCF yield of 3% with the potential to expand volumes and price with minimal capital intensity. Taking into account the portion of earnings retained by the company and the historic incremental return on invested capital 28%, the total return may be around 7-8% per annum.FICO is the industry standard in determining an individual's credit standing. End users of FICO products include 98 of the 100 largest financial institutions in the United States and two-thirds of the largest 100 banks in the world. FICO effectively receives a modest fee on a significant proportion of personal credit decisions made in the United States. This helps clients reduce the cost of doing business and minimise losses from risks and fraud. A regulatory push towards consistency and transparency has buttressed its leading market position, which stands at over 90% share of the business-to-business credit scores market. Such dominant industry positioning has allowed Fair Isaac to sustain highly attractive returns on capital margin and cash generation.The combination of strong cash generation and relatively low capital requirements has enabled FICO to buy-back significant amounts of stock over time, more than halving its share count in the last decade."
1540392,44821,2013-07-09T12:50:46-04:00,,"Most people know $1.7B (market cap) Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) better as FICO and think of it for their credit score rather than as an investment opportunity. That is an unfortunate mistake though, since FICO presents one of the most compelling and underappreciated plays on the housing industry and recovering economy right now. It is next to impossible for anyone to make any major purchase with a loan without paying FICO, albeit indirectly.For 57 years now, the company responsible for your credit score and behind all credit checks has had an effective monopoly on credit scores resulting in big profits for investors. As of 2006, FICO's next biggest competitor was Vantage Score with a total market share of 6% compared with 91% for FICO. The company doesn't generally sell its credit rating services and products directly to consumers, but instead sells them to large companies, particularly in the banking industry (myFico, a credit tool for consumers is the exception to this rule).The firm operates in three different segments, applications (~63% of revenues), scores (~26% of revenues), and tools (~11% of revenues). Applications are pre-configured software applications to help firms with issues like account origination, customer management, fraud claims management, etc. Scores include business-to-business scores and myFico score reports for consumers, while tools are more general software packages that allow business customers increased ability to use and customize the Fair Isaac Corp data.Now FICO's business is naturally very cyclical and tied to expansions in consumer credit. In particular, the more loans companies are making, the more credit checks are being done, and the more money FICO makes. So clearly FICO is poised to benefit greatly from the improving climate for automobiles, housing and business credit in general. As a result, the company's earnings per share, which were $2.34 last year, are expected to be $2.79 this year and $3.09 in 2014, according to analyst consensus. Given this growth rate, the firm looks like a good opportunity trading ~$47 a share after a recent pullback.This pullback in the firm's stock seems to have been due to concerns over the Fed derailing growth through tapering and the slowdown in China spreading to the US. Since both of these trends are likely to be persistent for at least the next few months, investors may have further opportunities to add to FICO in the short run. Over the medium and longer run though, the company should do very well in terms of increasing both earnings and revenues. This trend for the company has been very noticeable ever since the recession ended and it shows no signs of abating now.This table (below) of the firm's historical financial data offers evidence on this.As the table shows, FICO was hit hard by the financial crisis with revenues falling more than 25% between 2006 and 2010 as consumers and banks cut way back on credit and loans. Since then though, FICO's revenues have climbed back by 10%, and even more impressively the firm used the financial crisis to become leaner and more efficient with the result that EPS are now at an all time high.While some investors may be bothered by the fact that FICO's revenues have not yet returned to their pre-recession high, an alternative view is that this demonstrates the firm still has the realistic ability to obtain higher levels of revenue. As time goes on and credit use in the US starts to return to pre-crisis levels, FICO should be able to garner EPS in the range of $3-3.20. Analysts are projecting a return to these profit levels within 2 years, with EPS this year of $2.91 as the table below shows.As the table shows, during 2013, FICO's revenues have continued to increase during the first half of 2013. EPS came in below year ago levels as FICO has increased investments, but analysts are expecting increased figures in the second half of the year. For the full year, analysts are forecasting 14% EPS growth, giving the firm a 1.4 PEG ratio.While FICO carries a fair amount of long-term debt, the company has been paying this down steadily over the last few years using cash generated by the business. These actions, combined with regular share repurchases, have made the firm attractive despite the relatively low dividend.FICO's primary driver over the next few years is the expected expansion of credit as housing and auto sales rebound. Thus FICO is an attractive way to play expected rebounds in these markets while avoiding the euphoria which has hit homebuilders and auto companies of late. Given the strength in these industries it is not surprising that over the next 4 years analysts are projecting 16% top line growth on average for FICO.While FICO had a big run earlier this year, the recent Fed tapering talk pushed the stock back down, making shares look much more attractive at current levels as the chart below shows.In summary, Fair Isaac Corp looks like a good play on the housing and auto sales recovery.

1220821,41941,2013-02-25T10:21:14-05:00,,"Executive Summary:We believe that Fair Isaac (NYSE:FICO) is a medium quality company with a Business Quality Score of 4 based on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is best). Also, shares of Fair Isaac appear to be overvalued based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Fair Isaac stock would need to fall 28.4% to reach fair value based on the closing price of $44.10/share for Fair Isaac shares on 02-22-2013.Business Quality Analysis:Fair Isaac has a Business Quality Score of 4 out of 10 based on an analysis of historical data. We assign a Business Quality Score to each company undergoing analysis. The score is based on a scale of 1 to 10 with a value of 10 indicating the best possible Business Quality Score. Our Business Quality Score is a proprietary metric which takes into account the 10 year historical performance of the company. Performance is measured considering the absolute performance (and trends) in revenues, earnings, profit margins, and returns on assets/equity.Low Business Quality Scores (3 or lower) indicate companies that are in a cyclical or commodity business. These businesses have erratic revenues and earnings with associated low profit margins and poor returns on capital. Low quality companies operate in highly competitive/cyclical businesses where consistent profits are nearly impossible to achieve.Medium Business Quality Scores (4 to 6) indicate an average quality business that operates in a business environment that is not overly cyclical in nature. Also, the products or services these businesses provide are not yet commoditized but do operate in a highly competitive business environment. Moreover, these businesses do not have durable competitive advantages that will allow these businesses to earn consistently high returns on capital. Companies with a medium Business Quality Score can sometimes be good investments if bought at deeply discount prices and sold at fair value. This is in contrast to investments in businesses with high Business Quality Scores where paying fair value for shares can yield good returns if held for the long term.High Business Quality Scores (7 or higher) indicate companies that are in high quality businesses with some type of durable competitive advantages that keep competitors at bay. These businesses typically have steadily rising revenues and earnings with associated high profit margins and high returns on capital.Revenue:Fair Isaac's revenues have had flat performance over the last 10 years growing at an annualized growth rate of 0.7%. Revenues were quite erratic with no discernible trend during the period. Erratic revenues are an indicator of a low quality company which is one reason we gave Fair Isaac a Business Quality Score of 4. We believe that Fair Isaac will grow revenues at a 4.0% annualized growth rate over the next decade.Earnings Per Share:Fair Isaac's earnings grew at an annualized growth rate of 6.1% over the last decade. However, the trend in earnings was erratic with the earnings only growing in 5 out of 10 years. The overall trend in earnings is upward over the decade which is O.K. but we would prefer to see consistent earnings growth every year. Fair Isaac's less than stellar earnings history is the primary reason that we gave Fair Isaac a medium Business Quality Score of 4.A company's earnings per share is a measure of profitability for a company. The earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the common stock by the average number of common shares outstanding. One drawback in using earnings as a profitably measure is that it does not consider the amount of assets needed to generate the earnings. Earning the same profit using fewer assets is more profitable but this is not captured in the earnings per share calculation.High quality companies will have steadily rising earnings that do not vary greatly through a full business cycle (expansion-recession-expansion). Investing in high quality companies is fairly easy assuming an investor has realistic profit expectations and has the patience to wait for a reasonable stock price relative to the company's value.Lower quality (cyclical) companies will have earnings that vary greatly over a business cycle. Often these cyclical companies will experience a drastic reduction in earnings during economic recessions. Investment profits can be had with investments in cyclical companies but the timing of the buying and selling of the investment must be in sync with the ebb and flow of the stock market. Typically, the stock market will start to recover about 6 months before the economy comes out of recession. However, this point in time is not obvious in the moment and is only known latter with the benefit of hindsight. Furthermore, timing when to sell a cyclical stock is even more difficult. Timing the stock market is a matter of luck so it is best to stick with the higher quality stocks where market timing is not as critical to investing success.Net Profit Margin:Fair Isaac has had net profit margins in the range of 10.4% to 17% over the last 10 years with an average net profit margin of 13.1%. Fair Isaac's net profit margins were fairly high but not very consistent during the last decade. The net profit margin had a downward trend from 2003 through 2009 but has turned upward since 2010. Hopefully, this positive trend in the net profit margin will continue. In the future, we expect Fair Isaac's net profit margin to hover around its long term average of 13.1%.The net profit margin is net income divided by net revenues. For non-retailing companies, a consistent net profit margin of 7% or higher is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage. In the retailing sector a net profit margin in the range of 2.5% to 5% is the norm even for the best companies. Ideally, the net profit margin should be steady or rising over the past 10 years.Return On Assets:Fair Isaac has had a return on assets in the range of 5.1% to 9.6% over the last decade. Fair Isaac's performance in this regard is not impressive considering that the return on assets was under the critical 7.0% level in 4 out of 10 years. We expect the return on assets to hover around Fair Isaac's long term average return on assets of 7.3% in the coming decade.Return on assets is a measure of how much profit is generated from a company's assets independent of how much debt is used to finance the acquisition of those assets. The return on assets is sometimes a better measure of profitability than return on equity because the return on equity can be significantly increased by adding more debt to a company's balance sheet. Adding more debt to a company can inflate profits but comes at the price of a greater risk of bankruptcy.Measuring profitability using the return on assets does not have this problem because to calculate the return on assets the net income plus the interest expense net of income tax savings is divided by the average total assets of the company. Thus, by dividing the net income (adjusted for the affects of debt financing) by the total assets (debt + equity) of the company it cancels out the positive effects of debt.The return on assets is great for comparing the profitability of companies with different levels of debt in their capital structures. Generally speaking, a consistent return on assets of about 7% or more is a good indication of a good business with some type of durable competitive advantage. One exception to this rule of thumb is the banking sector where a return on assets of just 2% is considered exceptional.Return On Equity:Fair Isaac has had a return on equity in the range of 11.3% to 17.6% during the last 10 years. Fair Isaac's performance in this area is weak considering that the return on equity was below the critical 15% level in 6 out of 10 years during this period. We believe that Fair Isaac's return on equity will continue at its long term average of about 13.8% for the foreseeable future.Return on equity measures a company's performance in financing and using assets to generate earnings. In contrast to the return on assets, the return on equity considers the affect of financing in generating profits. To calculate the return on equity the net income (minus dividends paid on preferred stock) is divided by the average common shareholder's equity. As a rule of thumb, a consistent return on equity of 15% or more (assuming a reasonable level of debt financing) is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage.Valuation:A discounted cash flow analysis revealed a fair value for Fair Isaac shares of $31.55/share. We use the percent of revenue method in our discounted cash flow analysis. The model assumes a weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 10.1%. Our WACC is calculated using a proprietary formula unique to our firm. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 4.0% is projected over the next 10 years. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 3.0% is assumed for every year thereafter.Conclusion:Fair Isaac appears to be a medium quality company with an overvalued stock price. Based on a fair value of $31.55/share and the Fair Isaac closing stock price of $44.10/share (on 02-22-2013) the stock must fall 28.4% to reach fair value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1990011,52262,2014-02-04T20:02:53-05:00,,"Despite the Great Recession having ended years ago, financial services data company Fair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO) is only just now getting close to surpassing its pre-Recession revenue and net income levels. On a per share basis the stock is earning more than ever, but a broader look at the entire company reveals a firm still struggling with the after effects of the credit crisis. If economists' prognostications about a more robust US economy in 2014 prove true, then this could be a great year for FICO shareholders. Otherwise with the stock trading at a P/E multiple north of 20X and disappointing earnings, the company will remain dependent on major share buyback as a mechanism to advance investors' interests.San Jose, CA-based Fair Isaac is the original data analytics company. Back in the mid-1950's, the company was founded on the premise of using data to improve business decisions. A lot has changed since then, but providing data to business customers is still the focus of FICO's business today. In particular, FICO is a medium risk investment for investors in that while the company gets a recurring revenue stream from its data product customers, most of its business is built around the financial services arena, an area that has been struggling for several years now (at least outside of Wall Street). FICO's products are used to make decisions about credit issuance, particularly credit cards and mortgages - two areas which have changed a lot in the last five years, thanks to the Crisis and new regulations.FICO is best known for its FICO credit score which is used by banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, retailers, hospitals, and many more. The company collects data on consumers and their creditworthiness to form a credit score and then sells that score and related tools and software applications to firms to help them learn more about the individual consumers they are dealing with. While FICO has recently begun selling more services to consumers including access to their FICO score and related commentary, the large majority of the firm's business (more than 75%) is still accounted for by business-to-business sales. As a by-product of FICO's need to collect and process information, it has a very closing working relationship with the three major credit reporting agencies Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian (these relationships generally accounts for 15-20% of revenues as a result of sales agreements between the firms).The last 13 years have been a story in three acts for Fair Isaac. From 2001 through 2005, the company saw sales expand rapidly with an average annual CAGR approaching 20%, and FICO used its tremendous growth to buy up half-a-dozen small software companies along the way. Starting in 2006 through 2010 as the Crisis approached, credit dried up, and businesses clamped down on new originations across the financial space, FICO's sales growth came to a screeching halt. During these five years, FICO's revenues declined at an average pace of ~5% (granted, part of this was due to a sequence of small divestitures the firm made during this time). Finally starting in 2011, things began to turn around again with revenues rising slightly and then accelerating to around 10% growth in 2012 and 2013. Nonetheless, FICO's revenues, net income, and assets all remain notably below where they were in 2005-2006.Yet for all of its recent improvements, things at FICO still remain weak. The company reported its first quarter earnings for FY 2014 at the end of January. While overall earnings generally were in-line with estimates, revenues fell 3% year-over-year which (in combination with a weak broader market), has led to a more than 10% decline in share price over the last few weeks. In particular, revenues were slammed by a 10% decline in sales at FICO's Applications unit (which offers pre-configured decision management tools for specific situations like account origination). Analysts still seem optimistic and are looking for FY 2014 adjusted EPS of ~$3.30 with revenues expected to be up around 5% for the year.Given the sales issues in Applications (including the loss of a major client last December), and slower Bank Fraud product sales, this revenue growth number could be hard to hit - especially if mortgage originations stay slow like the market seems to expect. FICO has been focusing on organic growth of late rather than acquisitions, which is good in my view. The firm has a pretty broad product portfolio after all. Nonetheless, the current environment isn't making this easy especially in the banking industry where everyone is trying to cut costs, and credit origination remains tight. Bookings have been getting better over the last few years, but without a sustained increase in demand for credit and supply of it by banks, it is going to be very hard for FICO to keep sales growth going.Offsetting this, Fair Isaac has been buying back stock like crazy after a $150 million repurchase program was initiated in mid-2012, so EPS levels at the company remain in good shape. Yet aggregate earnings are still frustratingly inconsistent. FICO has been taking all the usual steps; managing headcount, cutting internal expenses, focusing product offerings, etc. This will only take a company so far though and without a more robust revenue backdrop, I don't see a lot of room for FICO to do much more than (optimistically) retrace its recent pullback. FICO has been paying down some debt that it took out in 2008 since 2010, and I expect it will continue doing this. While not the most exciting use of cash, it certainly is better than leaving it sitting in a company bank account earning nothing, and at this stage there aren't a lot of obvious acquisitions FICO can do that would help its situation markedly. Add to this situation the increasing competition from other consumer credit scoring systems like those from certain credit bureaus, and it's hard to see a good reason to buy into FICO right now. If the stock were to come down into the mid-$40s, it would be much more interesting, but otherwise, there are simply too many company-specific and macro-related challenges here to overlook.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

All of the top ten companies on the 2011 Fortune 500 list use FICO's solutionsOf course everyone in the US is well aware of FICO Credit Score. It's the unbeatable consumer credit score that is used by majority of credit institutions for credit decision making.With sound product offering and crowded clientele aside, let's take a look at the numbers.Moderate Revenue Growth but Sound FinancialsRevenue Growth (thousands)The US revenue growth seems to be stagnant, and could be attributed to the financial crises as majority of FICO's clients were financial institutions. However, the economic impact hasn't eaten into a huge portion of the revenues when compared to the huge losses that the major banks reported. With the US economy recovering, although at a slow pace, FICO's numbers will definitely improve.FICO has a huge opportunity in the emerging markets with major banks in Asia extending more credit to the growing middle-class population and the boom in the credit market. With that, the banks will need to implement a number of solutions offered by FICO and such. This is evident from the growth in the share of international revenues.Stock Fundamentals* Net profit margin averages at around 11%* Currently the P/B value is over 3. With a diluted EPS of $1.79, the P/E stands at around 20.* FICO also has sound financial structure with:- Debt ratio at 58.8- Interest cover of 4 times- Financial Leverage Ratio of 2.4 How will the stock perform?Let's use the EPS from the past 10 years and historical P/E multiple to estimate the range of future stock prices.Source: www.advfn.comAs we can see, the EPS growth in the past 10 years has neither been stellar nor consistent. However, it grew 26% in 2011. Excluding 2003 data point, the average EPS growth is about 5%. Assuming the same 5% growth in future, we can try to project the EPS as shown in the Scenario 1, Conservative projection gives us a price of $45 at some point in the next 5 years (using the past 9 year average P/E of 20 from the data above).Assuming the worst in the financial markets is over; the EPS growth could be far higher than we think. And if the economy sees a modest growth, and if the unemployment continues the recent positive trend, Mr. Market may buoy the stock higher. The stock may even hit $60s at some point in the next 5 years. But conservatively, we can expect the price to hit 50s in the next 5 years. As investors are well aware, the price we pay determines the return on investment. FICO, at current levels may not give great returns. It was a bargain when it was trading in mid 20s. One needs to express caution, when gobbling this stock during this bull-run for a quick return.But FICO definitely deserves credit for revolutionizing the credit analytics and decision making systems.Source: FICO Annual Report 2011Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
813762,25120,2012-08-17T08:30:18-04:00,,"Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) announced on Thursday that it has agreed to acquire UK-based Adeptra Ltd. in a transaction valuing the company at $115 million.The DealFair Isaac Corporation announced that it will acquire Adeptra in an all cash transaction valuing the company at $115 million. Privately-held Adeptra is a leader in cloud-based customer engagement and risk intervention systems. Its solutions allow companies to communicate with their customers in real time, and it has 50 major clients across the world. The company helps its customers in fraud resolution, payment plans and confirmations.Adeptra reported annual revenues of $38.2 million in 2011, up 15.7% on the year. EBITDA rose 165% to $2.9 million. Revenues for the first six months of 2012 rose 33.9% to $24.3 million, while EBITDA rose 146% to $2.6 million. The deal values the company at roughly 2.3 times annual revenues, based on a conservative $50 million revenue estimate for the full year. The company is valued at roughly 23 times annual EBITDA on a conservative $5 million estimate.Fair Isaac sees strategic synergies from the acquisition. FICO's decision management solution and Adeptra's customer engagement and risk intervention platform provide full-cycle solutions. The integration allows the company to accelerate success in the fast-growing mobile economy.The deal is expected to close as soon as September, and be accretive to 2013's earnings.ValuationFair Isaac reported its third quarter results on the 25th of July. Third quarter revenues came in at $160 million, up 7% on the year. GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.59. The company operates with $274 million in cash and equivalents, sufficient to finance the acquisition.Valued at $1.5 billion, the market values the company at 2.5 times annual revenues and 17 times trailing annual earnings. Currently, Fair Isaac pays a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.2%.Investment ThesisShares of Fair Isaac have returned 24% so far in 2012. Shares quickly moved upwards from $35 in January, to trade within a $40-$45 trading range in the remainder of the year thus far.Banks are slowly coming back in the market for consumer lending. For them, it is crucial to have good ways to distinguish good from bad credit, which boosts Fair Isaac's business. The company is actively trying to adjust its famous ""FICO"" scores to update it with more real time information, and the acquisition of Adeptra fits perfectly within the strategy.Over the past years, revenues fell from $745 million in 2008 to $620 million in 2011, as consumer lending fell over time. Earnings per share rose from $1.64 to $1.79 over that time period. The company repurchased over 20% of its shares outstanding during that time period. Shares have traded flat for the past five years, but have seen steep declines in the middle of the crisis.Investors reacted favorably to the announcement of the deal, and the announcement of another $150 million share buyback program. The program is sufficient to retire 10% of Fair Iscaac's shares outstanding. Shares rose 1.5% in Wednesday's trading session.I think that Fair Isaac made a strategically strong acquisition, which boosts the company's growth profile, amid increasing mobile adoption. Furthermore, the company remains committed to retire shares, boosting earnings per shares. I see no immediate triggers for an upside move in the short term, but would be confident to hold shares for the long term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

4379371,104695,2020-10-16T10:00:00-04:00,Fiserv and Fidelity National Information Services are both leading financial service technology providers in the core banking and payment processing industry with broad product and service portfolios and highly recurring revenues with financial institutions.FISV and FIS are seeking to capitalize on the digital transformation in the financial industry and are building end-to-end solutions through the acquisitions of First Data and Worldpay.Fiserv’s advantage stems from its wider portfolio breadth and deeper relationships with smaller banks and credit unions driving solid growth.FIS has a relatively larger exposure to bigger banks which are expected to ramp up their modernization initiatives to counter emerging competition from new fintech entrants.Revenues of both companies are expected to grow by more than 10% annually.,"Source: Fiserv, FISFiserv Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) are leading financial service technology providers. At the of heart of it, both companies' business models specialize in providing core banking processing solutions to financial institutions to conduct their day-to-day operations. Due to high switching costs and multiyear contracts, it provides steady cash flows and highly recurring revenue streams.Boasting decades of market experience, both companies have their unique reasons to own their stock. Fiserv has the widest product breadth allowing it to attain a massive client base. Its clients mix is relatively more geared towards smaller-size banks and credit unions. These firms choose Fiserv as their one-stop technology provider, while FIS has a bigger exposure to larger banks that choose it for its flexibility and strong product family integration capabilities. As incumbent banks ramp up their modernization initiatives to fend off competition from emerging fintech players. Besides that, both companies have also expanded into rapidly growing payments solutions to build up an end-to-end solution for clients in the wake of a digital transformation of financial services.A core banking system is utilized by financial institutions to process daily banking transactions and post updates to accounts and financial records. These typically include deposit, loan and credit processing solutions integrated to general ledger systems. They also include other value-added customer relationship management solutions which are essential for maintaining bank to client relationships.The core banking market is highly competitive and is led by Fiserv, Fidelity National Information Services and Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY). These firms have decades of experience and cumulatively account for over 70% of market share. Their long-term stability has been attributable to their core banking solutions forming the legacy systems in most financial institutions today. The importance to prevent disruption to daily operations means that switching costs are very high, providing additional stability to these firms.Source: FedFisNevertheless, the core banking systems market is transforming as banks digitalize. The emerging developments of open banking from new fintech entrants mean that the incumbent financial institutions must ramp up their technology initiatives despite legacy barriers. According to eMarketer, the US bank IT budget has grown to $64 bln in 2019. We forecast the strength to continue and expect banks' IT expenditures to reach over $100bln by 2025, representing a CAGR of 8.85%. Several factors supporting this estimate are:Source: eMarketer, Khaveen InvestmentsTo implement this transformation, banks which traditionally relied on in-house capabilities may consider migrating to third-party providers which offers cost benefits due to scale. These institutions are expected to implement targeted modernization initiatives to capitalize on new opportunities, motivated by the need for business agility, compliance and channel enablement. Therefore, this would benefit core banking vendors including FISV and FIS.FiservAs a core banking provider, Fiserv is the best in class with over 4,000 financial institutions including credit unions and banks of all sizes implementing Fiserv's core technology. Compared to FIS, its client mix has a larger exposure to credit unions, making up about 40% of total clients. About one third of US credit unions depend on Fiserv for their core account processing needs. Two primary reasons explain Fiserv's market leadership, its superior number of core deployments and the breadth of its product portfolio. The completeness of its core offerings allows it to meet the needs of any financial institution, which is especially important for smaller firms that look to Fiserv to be their primary technology partner.Fiserv leads the market in the number of core offerings which is the highest amongst competitors. Under its Financial segment, Fiserv provides a range of highly functional and scalable accounts processing and item processing services. Its primary offerings are DNA, Premier, Cleartouch, Portico, Precision and Signature. These solutions enable financial institutions to handle customer deposits and loan accounts, general ledger and other financial information.Overall, we believe its competitive advantage among credit unions and smaller banks lies in its product portfolio breadth. This drives most financial institutions to choose Fiserv as its technology partner, especially the smaller institutions, allowing the firm to achieve a massive client base. Its strategy is to maintain its base through cross-selling and upselling; for example, selling account processing to clients who are on its credit processing solutions. This allows the firm to deepen its client relationships, and it signs multiyear contracts which will result in high switching costs and deter substitution to competitors. Thus, we are optimistic on Fiserv's core banking prospects as its clients will likely choose the firm for their digitalization initiatives and estimate growth to be line with the market at 8.85%.FISCompared to FISV, FIS is second in the core banking solutions market. It serves a smaller client base; over 1,000 financial institutions are using its core banking platforms. Although it serves all financial institutions including banks of all sizes and credit unions, its specialization is with larger banks. More than 70 of its clients have assets over $10 bln, while Fiserv has less than half than that.Source: Aite GroupThe firm's advantage with larger banks stems from its higher level of customization and integration capabilities of its core offerings. Its primary core offerings are IBS, Profile, Systematics and Horizon. These solutions offer a range of configuration suites while enabling timely product to market by banks. In terms of architecture, FIS has been credited for its open architecture allowing for greater integration as well as the ability to incorporate value-added solutions such as data analytics capabilities providing cross-selling and upselling opportunities.Thus, although both FISV and FIS products similarly cater to all types and sizes of financial institutions, FIS has developed an advantage over Fiserv with its core integration strength allowing it to achieve larger exposure to banking segments. Moreover, FIS has deployed a Modern Banking Platform comprising an integrated core platform delivering an omnichannel banking experience. The platform is designed to leverage the emerging open banking trend and may provide a boost to the firm's growth.We believe FIS's larger exposure to bigger banks relative to Fiserv is positive. Despite higher bargaining power from customers, modernization initiatives by larger banks could be a key driver for the firm. Traditionally, large incumbent banks face barriers to digitalization initiatives because of strong reliance on proven solutions. However, the rising competition from emerging fintech entrants may push a modernization drive. Larger banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BofA (NYSE:BAC) are likely to increase technology spend in the coming years according to a survey from UBS Evidence Lab. Thus, we expect FIS's Financial segment to outpace Fiserv at 9.22% due to its larger bank exposure, assuming a ramp-up of tech spend of 0.5% of assets.Both Fiserv and FIS have expanded into the payments processing market with the acquisition of First Data by Fiserv and Worldpay by FIS. Merchant acquiring or payment processing enables payment acceptance on behalf of merchants with credit, debit cards and mobile wallets. The market was valued at $33.45 bln in 2019. We project it to grow at CAGR of 14%, which is in line with non-cash transaction growth estimates by Capgemini. This is driven by evolving customer preferences for cashless payments and e-commerce. Processors are also leveraging cloud-based technologies for seamless integration as well as machine learning and AI in fraud detection and data analytics. The market consists of several large institutions with FIS (Worldpay), Chase and Fiserv (First Data) leading the market handling over $1 tln in transactions annually each.Source: Nilson ReportFiservThe acquisition of First Data, a leader in merchant acquiring, provides Fiserv integration opportunities with its payments segment for card-based processing while opening a new market for it in rapidly growing payments acceptance space.Source: FiservThe combined company provides several benefits by enabling value creation for account processing clients and deepening relationships. The firm is seeking to link their respective merchant and cash capabilities and develop new offerings. This creates a differentiated, end-to-end payments platform from issuance to acceptances, also enabling additional payment methods. Highly complementary products and distribution channels allow for cross-selling opportunities. For example, First data's Clover POS system for commercial clients and biller solutions from Fiserv.First Data has already made a huge impact on Fiserv, contributing 40% of revenues. In the long term, the firm expects to achieve revenue synergies of $500 mln and cost savings of $900mln from an enriched value proposition through integration of technology infrastructure, expanded payment offerings and integrated sales.The combination of both companies could effectively create a payments powerhouse in the long term. We expect its segments to grow in line with payment processing market growth of 14%, as the integration solidifies Fiserv's existing payment services including electronic bill payments, account-to-account transfers, P2P payments, debit and credit card processing services, thereby allowing the firm to capitalize on the increasing trends towards digital, real-time and secure payments.FISSimilar to Fiserv, the acquisition of Worldpay provides product integration opportunities. It is reported under its Merchant segment and accounts for nearly 20% of revenues, enabling merchants to accept electronic payments at the physical POS as well as online and mobile payments. We believe the key advantage of the FIS-Worldpay acquisition could be derived from its relationships with banks and a strong focus on open development tools in the open banking era. As open banking and faster payments grow, there is an increasing importance of the ability to offer end-to-end solutions.Source: FISBy taking advantage of its highly configurable portfolio with strong product family integration capabilities, we believe FIS can combine financial services, processing and risk management powered by a robust network. Moreover, the emergence of open banking would also result in the need for secure data sharing. Regulations such as Europe's PSD2 could be a major catalyst for FIS for its security solutions, which it could use to leverage its relationships with banks and Worldpay with its familiarity with European markets.Overall, the merger of Worldpay with FIS provides size and scale to accelerate growth, and we expect this segment to grow in line with our market estimates of 14%. Compared with Fiserv, FIS has deep relationships with large banks on top of a highly differentiated product portfolio in the wake of open banking. The combination enables an end-to-end payment solution and multiple cross-selling opportunities. For example, executing both transaction and ledger settlement. In the long term, FIS expects to achieve revenue synergies of $500 mln and cost savings of $400 mln from operational synergies and technology integration.Net DebtIn terms of debt, the acquisitions by Fiserv and FIS are one of their largest deals ever, resulting in elevated debt levels in both companies since the past year. Fiserv has a higher net debt of $42 bln compared to FIS at $30 bln, suggesting a higher financial risk for the company.Source: Fiserv, FISHowever, both Fiserv and FIS maintain healthy EBITDA interest coverage ratios. Fiserv's EBITDA interest coverage ratio stood at 5.3x in 2019, while FIS had a slightly better ratio at 5.8x, indicating strong abilities to service debt for both companies. In addition, both companies have strong earnings and cash flow generation abilities.MarginsFiserv's earnings and margins have generally outperformed FIS. Its revenue has grown steadily at an average rate of 12.2% in the past nine years with a gross and net margin of 48.36% and 5.77% respectively in 2019. Excluding its acquisition of First Data, it has an average free cash flow margin of 15.84%, which is slightly higher than FIS.Source: FiservFIS's revenues have grown 8.61% in the past nine years with a gross margin and net margin of 36.03% and 2.66% respectively in 2019. Excluding its acquisition of Worldpay, it has an average free cash flow margin of 11.47%.Source: FISRevenueSource: Fiserv, FISTo value both companies, we use a DCF analysis by projecting both companies' revenue growth. Revenue growth in 2019 for both firms were significantly higher due to the recognition of revenues of the combined entities. We expect Fiserv's revenue to grow at a slightly higher rate than FIS at 10.6% due mainly to its relatively larger exposure to payments with First Data segment accounting for a higher share of revenues compared to FIS. Though we expect FIS's core banking segment to outperform Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsRelative ValuationSource: Seeking AlphaDCFBased on a DCF analysis, with an EV/EBITDA multiple of 23.71x (Core and Payment Processing Industry average) and a discount rate of 6.9% (company WACC), while assuming revenue growth of 10.6% before tapering off at a long-term growth assumption of 6% due to its highly recurring nature of revenues, our model shows an upside of 31.36% for Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsFor FIS, based on an EV/EBITDA of 23.71x, we applied a discount rate of 8% (company WACC) and a revenue growth rate of 10.64% before tapering out at a long-term growth rate of 6%, our model shows a smaller upside of 6.39% compared to Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsAs market leaders, both companies have solid portfolio breadth and deep relationships with clients built on decades of expertise and are two top picks to ride out the digitalization of banking. However, we believe Fiserv edges out FIS slightly. This stems from its wider product portfolio, enabling it to attain a larger client base compared to FIS. Its deeper relationships with smaller institutions and credit unions should provide steady growth ahead as they would continue choosing Fiserv as their main technology partner. Thus, its larger and diversified client base minimizes the risks to the company. On the other hand, despite its smaller base, FIS has been credited for its strong integration capabilities and product customization, which makes it a favored provider by banks. As larger banks undergo modernization initiatives, FIS should benefit from its larger exposure to this segment. Though, the higher bargaining power of larger clients could negatively affect the company, while Fiserv's smaller client base has a lower bargaining power.To conclude, notwithstanding the risk of declining financial institutions because of mergers and acquisitions and strong competition from other vendors, rapid digitalization and emergence of open banking are creating a need for end-to-end solutions.Both Fiserv and FIS are seeking to capitalize on this by leveraging their existing capabilities and acquisitions such as payments. Despite Fiserv's slight advantage, we rate both Fiserv and FIS as a Buy with a target price of $113.03 (FISV) and $155.88 (FIS).Note: For more research and analysis of high-quality companies within the global fintech industry, please click the ""Follow"" icon at the top of this page."
4334381,105417,2020-03-26T11:57:37-04:00,"FIS should see coronavirus impact at each of its businesses, albeit in each case the impact shall be minimal.Our total revenue headwinds for 2020 are in the order of approximately $300 MM.This is not the Financial Crisis of 2008 and, therefore, banks themselves - the main clients of FIS - are in a much better shape.","In our January 6 update (See Article), we previewed the fourth quarter results and analyzed near-term tailwinds for the company. In this note, we reorient the discussion to address core issues that are important for the company in light of the coronavirus outbreak. What distinguishes FIS from many other names under our coverage is the fact that the company should see a fairly minimal impact to each of its businesses. We discuss these businesses specifically below, in addition to providing an updated valuation. Overall, we remain positive on FIS, seeing its recurring revenue base and strong capital return story as integral to market outperformance in 2020-21.For FIS, we are only moderately reducing our target price, which further reinforces our confidence in the stock. We are taking down our 2020 P.E multiple from 24x to 23x, while reducing the EPS estimate from $6.78 to $6.59. When we apply the multiple of 23x to the EPS of $6.59, we get the target price of $151, down from $162.Capco: This is mainly a European consulting business, with several hundred million of annual revenue workstreams. At present, most of Europe has come to a halt; however, Italy and Spain - the two most affected countries - are not integral to Capco. Assuming that other countries do not succumb to such a fiasco, we expect a V-shaped recovery in Europe, with 2Q and likely some of 3Q losses mostly recouped in 4Q 2020. At present, we are estimating $39 MM in annual revenue Capco hit during 2020 and only $11 MM in 2021.Brazil Business: While it is too early to tell how prevalent the virus will be in Latin America, so far Brazil and neighboring regions have been largely spared. FIS's two core clients, according to our estimates, will cumulatively incur less than $20 MM in economic damages, even if the outbreak accelerates in that part of the world.ACH Processing: This segment was already fairly soft even before the virus. We do not anticipate a major hit since demand is fairly inelastic for ATM usage and the banks integration. Our headwind estimate is $10-15 MM annually at most. Debit Services: We expect debit services growth to slow down in 2020 by approximately 40-55 bps, registering around 4% Y/Y and producing a headwind of $62-$75 MM for 2020. We expect FIS' established clients, largely mid-cap banks, to remain loyal; however, some of the newer accounts may in fact demonstrate some fluctuations. For this particular segment, more data is certainly needed to make a more precise top-line headwind estimate. Mobile Payments: We see mobile segment to grow 6-7% Y/Y, just about a percentage point below our original expectations, which should deliver about a $90 MM hit to the revenue base, constituting the largest impact of the segments we are analyzing. Mobile is the most dynamic of FIS' businesses; it is directly tied to the consumer behavior, and that's why some degree of slowness needs to be modeled. GFS Back-End Solutions: In our view, back-end solutions will once again prove to be integral to the company's operations and will likely lead to less than $10 MM of quarterly negative impact. Assuming that two full quarters are impacted, we are only considering $20 MM at most.ATM Solutions: Technology empowering the ATMs should remain robust, since we are not expecting any demand pressures for the ATM business. If anything, it would be the role of FIS to ensure cybersecurity and the overall smoothness of the ATM operations. Therefore, our estimates remain unchanged in that department.IFS Outsourcing: The rule of thumb is that companies do outsourcing work during times of economic hardship in order to slash costs, while cutting back on more optional consulting engagements (see paragraph on Capco). IFS outsourcing work has always been not only integral to the banks' core operations, but also always represented one of the lower-cost processes that FIS can offer. We estimate only $15-$18 MM in revenue headwinds. The bottom line is: this is not the Financial Crisis of 2008 and, therefore, banks themselves - the main clients of FIS - are in a much better shape. Share Buybacks: While this is not related to the revenue streams, we expect share authorization to remain in place, potentially resulting in $400-$500 MM in buybacks for 2020 alone, similar to our original projections. The company is not among the recipients of the upcoming bailout package, which is about to be passed by the US Congress: therefore, there are no attached strings to the capital return. In addition, we expect FIS to fully support its 1.2% dividend yield. 1. Global economic macro conditions, stemming from the coronavirus or for other reasons, may further adversely impact consumer confidence and thus lead to lower demand for the company’s services.2. Security breaches could harm FIS's business, disrupting delivery of services and resulting in a breach of client contracts.3. More intense regulatory environment, both domestically and internationally, may lead to an increase in costs and thus impact the company’s bottom line.4. The sales and implementation cycles for software can be lengthy and require significant investment from the company’s clients. If there are interruptions along this implementation cycle, then the processes can be impacted along the way."

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the company, leading to underperformance compared to its 1Q20 guidance. Now, FIS faces some near-term headwinds to its operating segments. While the company has taken steps to cut expenses and has a solid balance sheet with solid liquidity, the stock has not fully returned to previous levels. Now may be an opportunity to invest in a company that was beaten up but has many macro catalysts to propel it forward.Fidelity serves the banking and financial institutions sector. It operates in three segments: Merchant Services, Capital Market Solutions and Banking Solutions. What is appealing about FIS is the solid growth prospects, strong margins, and the fact that it is a player in the eCommerce payment and digitization areas. With the tailwind of bank and financial institutions shifting to digitization of records and transactions, and global eCommerce capabilities (through the recent Worldpay acquisition), coupled with achievable synergy goals, capital allocation strategy and operating leverage, Fidelity stock should see price appreciation in the near to medium term.Over the last several years, FIS has disposed of lower-growth and -margin business and made several key acquisitions to be in the forefront of secular trends - omnichannel banking services and digital offerings. This really kicked into gear with the closing of the Worldpay acquisition in 2019. It has paved the way for growth in global merchant services and global eCommerce, including ""card not present"" technology. Global retail eCommerce is growing fast and is expected to double to $6.5 trillion in 2023 from $3.5 trillion in 2019. As such, retail eCommerce will represent 22% of total retail sales. There is plenty of room for the global merchant services segment.The potential for the Worldpay acquisition has not been fully realized. Per the FY19 earnings press release, the run rate revenue synergies are $200 million in FY20 and $550 million in FY22. Expenses synergies are $600 million and $675 million, respectively. The real kicker is that this was an improvement from prior estimates! The revenue synergy goals were reiterated in the 1Q20 earnings press release, and the expense synergy goals was increased to $700 million in FY20. Fidelity already has strong adjusted EBITDA margins and executed on these synergies, especially on the expense side, which should provide a catalyst for multiple expansion.The company has stable revenue stream in its Banking and Capital Market segments through multi-year contracts with a diverse customer base. The recurring revenue for the Banking segment is 83% and for the Capital markets segment is 70%. Organic growth was in the mid- to high single digits in all three segments, leading to a total 6% organic growth in FY 19. Digitizing the information in the banking industry is expected to grow at a ~4% CAGR over the next five years.There has been significant investment into R&D to create new products and services that would be desirable to the company's customer base, including its cloud-native core banking solution - the Modern Banking Platform and Digital One, a single integrated omnichannel banking platform. These products were well-received, as SaaS has seen strong growth as the company's capital market customers continue to modernize their technology needs. With Digital One, the focus has been marketing to regional banks, and FIS will begin to focus on community banks. This highlights the importance of banks seeking to outsource solutions to address regulatory requirements. As highlighted in the S&P article, many smaller regional and community banks do not have the resources to upgrade their technology to capture online deposits, digital payments and regulatory requirements. FIS already offers products to this bank segment, and the shift to smaller banks could boast revenue to the underserved market, especially if IT budgets are going up. Competitors, such as Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR), are also capturing regulatory outsourcing market share and digitization of information. These developments had management guide for good near-term organic growth targets, as CFO Woody Woodall explains:Margins are pretty fat. As FIS has grown, it has been able to spread its operating expense across a wider customer base. This is driven by the secular growth trends highlighted earlier and by cross-selling. Adjusted EBITDA margins have been further supported by synergies in the Worldpay acquisition and an increase in transaction volume.Source: 2019 10-KAs mentioned earlier, margin expansion should create a multiple expansion on the valuation side. Additionally, free cash flow should increase and offer the company an opportunity to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and/or dividends. This also could be a catalyst for multiple expansion.The FY20 guidance provided was a sight to see.Source: 2019 Earnings PresentationMr. Woodall continued in the conference call:This is really great stuff to hear. Management even guided for free cash flow to double by fiscal year-end 2022! This is all tied together with the revenue and expense synergies. The businesses they serve provide strong margins, and accompanied with expected growth, FIS will continue to be a free cash flow machine.As you can see below, investors liked what they read, too. The stock increased six percent over a two-day period. The FY 2019 earnings release was on 2/13/20.Data by YChartsThen, the COVID-19 pandemic struck and shelter-at-home was implemented. This took a lot of wind out of the company's sails. 1Q20 financial performance missed guidance and organic growth was stale. What was important for investors was the makeup of recurring revenues, the makeup of the customer base for the Merchant Services segment, synergy goals and leverage expectations.The Banking segment is the largest at 46% of revenue, and recurring revenue is 83%. Capital Markets has solid footing with 70% recurring revenue. Okay, that is good thus far. There is some room for the Capital Markets segment to fall some more, as 30% is transactional in nature. The real problem is the Merchant Services, which is 32% of revenue. 60% of revenue is traditional point of sale and could have moderate impact of future revenue. What is disheartening is the exposure to travel, entertainment and restaurant, which makes up 25% of revenue.Source: 1Q20 Earnings PresentationDespite the early challenges, management has seen improvement in the Merchant Solutions segment as the lockdowns have largely ceased, as well as improvement in non-discretionary spending. A quick recovery in reopening restaurants, hotels, etc. and consumer confidence will help this segment. This is a tough pill to swallow, but management has taken steps to improve the income statement.As mentioned earlier, the Worldpay expense synergies have been increased. On top of that, management has identified $300 million in additional savings. Mr. Woodall explains:The last paragraph is should help ease some of the pain. FY20 guidance and the 2.75x leverage goal has been rescinded or pushed back, but margin expansion is a pleasant surprise despite what is expected to be a lower revenue base. On top of this, the balance sheet remains solid with $3 billion in liquidity and an investment grade rating. The guided margin expansion has provided a base for the stock price and a good reason for why it did not go lower.Despite these near-term challenges, I think this represents a buying opportunity. Even with slower near-term growth, the stock is undervalued. Once the economies across the globe open up, FIS will be there to capture the increase in spending volume. There are too many catalysts and tailwinds to keep this company down. Global retail eCommerce, digitization of information, and outsourcing regulatory requirements are all in the early stages with years of growth. Furthermore, the expected expense synergies and operating leverage will increase free cash flow and capital allocation to shareholders. Currently, the stock is ~14% off its 52-week high. While I do not think that the stock will trade that high with the trouble in the Merchant segment, once that area is cleaned up, the $158 52-week high should be a short-term target. There may be some pain for the stock price as management works through the crisis."
4305423,105417,2019-11-11T11:40:31-05:00,"Solid quarter beat opens door for revenue acceleration in 2020.Both Merchant and Banking Solutions segments both continue to be core drivers of the top-line.Worldpay integration is going well, both in terms of cost synergies and free cash flow generation.","If you are looking for a stock that rallies 15% after earnings, FIS is not your story. Rather, we are talking about a financial technology player that rises slowly but surely, while preserving 1) solid recurring revenue (about 80%); 2) double-digit earning growth (not all quarters, but most); 3) at least 2-3% capital return in dividends and buybacks. At the same time, it's a low beta stock, so if the stock rises ~2-3% in the quarter's aftermath - then this was a very good quarter.In light of this introduction, let us review the company's description and valuation, and then discuss some key takeaways from the 3Q quarter earnings results.Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) focuses on financial services technology (payment processing, financial software and banking solutions), with its main clients are in institutional banking, payments, asset management and capital markets. The company has a presence in over 100 countries, employing 47,000+ people. FIS provides software, services and technology outsourcing to its core clients. Among the company’s main solutions are core processing; fraud, risk management and compliance solutions; electronic ePayment and digital solutions; securities processing and finance solutions, among others. Composed of Integrated Financial Solutions (""IFS"") and Global Financial Solutions (GFS) groups, the company has seen steady top line growth across both segments, with at least 80% recurring revenue. Overall, historically, FIS managed to achieve at least mid single-digit top line growth, low teens earnings growth, as well as at least 2-3% capital return in the form of share buybacks and dividends.When we compare FIS to its core competitors, such as Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), we believe that the IFS solutions segment merits at least a 24x PE multiple on 2020 earnings. When we apply the multiple of 24x to our new 2020 EPS estimate of $6.78 (up from $6.71), we get the target price of $162 (up from $161).Solid Quarter Beat: With the company delivering an 8 cent EPS and $22 MM revenue beat, revenue of $2.8 billion (with two months of Worldpay) grew 35% Y/Y. We saw another strong quarterly performance of Capco and mobile, coupled with double-digit growth in the international business. Not only did FIS raised its fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, and EPS targets, but it also upped the 2020 cost synergy target.Acceleration of Both Revenue and Growth Synergies: Benefits of debit card routing led to $30 MM of revenue growth synergies, with the $150 MM target by 2020 and $500 MM target by 2022 clearly ahead of schedule. On the cost side, management claims that FIS ""achieved more than $200 million in annualized run rate cost synergies exiting the third quarter"", which led the company to up its annual cost synergy target by $50 MM to $350 MM.Merchant Solutions Continues to Deliver Robust Growth: The segment grew 8% organically and generated 52% (!) EBITDA margin, with the actual EBITDA coming in at $371 MM. The company expects Merchant Solutions to accelerate sales growth to approximately 10% Y/Y in 4Q, but we actually expect this figure to be around 11%-11.3%, given how conservatively management guides.Banking Solutions Segment Rose 5% Y/Y, Driven by Continued New Sales. While the EBITDA margin on this segment is trending around 40% (largely due to new investments in technology), this segment definitely is a prime example of how rapidly FIS can translate new sales into a recurring revenue stream. We believe that in 2020 it is going to be true not so much in the US, but in Europe and Latin America.Capital Allocation Remains Strong As Ever: With approximately 23% of revenue converted into free cash flow, the company continues to channel FCF toward capital return and debt repayment. FIS already paid down more $700 million of outstanding debt since closing Worldpay, even while funding integration. The present leverage target is 2.7x by the end of 2020.Debit Growth To Offset Pockets Of Softness in ACH Processing: We note that the debit strength is almost entirely driven by new accounts, which have been materializing over the last two quarters and offsetting pockets of negative growth from ACH.Continued Strength In Digital And Mobile Payments Segments: We do not see meaningful acceleration in either of these segments in 2020, but growth of approximately 6% (down from our earlier 6-7% Y/Y target) should be realistic.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the business at FIS:1. Security breaches could harm FIS's business, disrupting delivery of services and resulting in a breach of client contracts.2. Global economic macro conditions may adversely impact consumer confidence and thus lead to lower demand for the company’s services.3. More intense regulatory environment, both domestically and internationally, may lead to an increase in costs and thus impact the company’s bottom line.4. The sales and implementation cycles for software can be lengthy and require significant investment from the company’s clients. If there are interruptions along this implementation cycle, then the processes can be impacted along the way."

        For 2020, we estimate 5-6% Y/Y revenue growth, with some tuck-ins and share buybacks authorization increase likely.","In this article, we are providing a preview of 4Q results for Fidelity National Information Systems, in addition to discussing the upcoming guidance the company will issue. FIS remains one of our favorite names, mainly because of its recurring revenue base and solid capital story return. We also see its revenue streams as sticky and poised to see upside from the payments space. The company continues to benefit from tailwinds in the financial outsourcing space, where in the US penetration remains relatively low and internationally this segment is only taking off, with plenty of opportunities for 2020 and beyond. When we compare FIS to its core competitors, such as Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), we believe that the IFS solutions segment merits at least a 24x PE multiple on 2020 earnings. When we apply the multiple of 24x to our 202 EPS estimate of $6.78, we get the target price of $162. We note that our estimates stayed unchanged from our November update. See our most recent Article on FIS, where we also discuss the company's business and various risk factors it faces. In addition, please see our recent pieces on the company's international business (See Article) and our discussion from September on key catalysts (See Article). Our core thesis remains Bullish, driven by the secular growth opportunities within the payments and financial outsourcing space, and supported by the strong recurring revenue, double digit earnings growth, and consistent capital return. Expect above-consensus revenue growth: For 4Q19, we estimate 5.7% Y/Y revenue growth, which is approximately 50 bps above current consensus (we note that consensus can still change, as more analysts update their models). Our above-consensus estimates are driven by 1) solid performance of mobile; 2) expansion of Capco in Europe; and 3) payments segment of the non-European international business. Below, we discuss each of these revenue drivers, in addition to commenting on our 2020 guidance expectations.Mobile is one of the company's top drivers: We say this at the risk of sounding like a broken record, but this promises to be another strong quarter for the mobile business. There is an ongoing secular transition from the physical to online checking (about 60% complete) to mobile (at least than 15-20% complete), with FIS extracting meaningful benefits from the latter. The company's mobile solutions have now extended to more than 70% of its mid-cap banking clients, as well as credit unions. During the fourth quarter, we expect mobile growth at 8%+, outpacing company-wide revenue growth by more than 200 bps. Capco to benefit from new client growth: The European consulting business was expected to see an inflow of new clients in 2019, with the bulk of them in Q3 and Q4. This in itself should provide robust revenue tailwinds for the company, likely resulting in a 30-40 bps upside for the business. It is also our understanding that Capco margins remain fairly stable. International segment to grow around 13% Y/Y: Both Europe and especially Latin America should contribute to solid growth in payments, cumulatively resulting in approximately 13% Y/Y revenue growth. Recall that FIS historically had some of the largest clients in Brazil, such as Bradesco, and growth traction from these clients continues to accelerate, particularly with debit adoption and (see above) more penetration in mobile. We also expect low-mid teens growth to carry forward into 2020.Expect share buyback authorization increase in 2020: As we contemplate prospective guidance for 2020, we expect the company to increase its share buyback authorization by anywhere between $300 and $500 MM. This should maintain the company's 2-3% capital return range. Revenue outlook for 2020: We believe that digital and mobile will continue to drive the top-line in 2020, supporting 5-6% Y/Y revenue growth. In addition, while we don't expect ACH processing softness to entirely go away, we believe it may be less prevalent this year. Our current estimates call for 3-4% domestic growth and 12-13% Y/Y international growth. Possible tuck-ins on the horizon: While we don't expect a major deal in 2020, we see several tuck-ins as a possibility and dependent on the free cash flow availability. We believe that these deals may come on the international size, around $30-$50 MM each."
4293935,105417,2019-09-27T13:31:23-04:00,"The company delivers solid mid-single-digit growth, with about 80% of revenue recurring.With effective cost-cutting on the way, we see FIS maintaining at least 10% Y/Y earnings growth.Capital return story remains attractive, with the company committed to returning about 90% of its free cash flows in the form of buybacks and dividends back to shareholders.","Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) focuses on financial services technology (payment processing, financial software and banking solutions), with its main clients in institutional banking, payments, asset management and capital markets. The company has presence in over 100 countries, employing 47,000+ people. FIS provides software, services and technology outsourcing to its core clients. Among the company’s main solutions are core processing; fraud, risk management and compliance solutions; electronic ePayment and digital solutions; securities processing and finance solutions, among others. Composed of Integrated Financial Solutions (IFS) and Global Financial Solutions (GFS) groups, the company has seen steady top-line growth across both segments, with at least 80% recurring revenue. Overall, historically, FIS managed to achieve at least mid-single-digit top-line growth, low-teens earnings growth, as well as at least 2-3% capital return in the form of share buybacks and dividends.When we compare FIS to its core competitors, such as Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), we believe that the IFS solutions (more on the below) merit at least 0.5x revenue multiple premium to the historical 5.3x average industry multiple. When we apply the multiple of 5.8x to our $9.315 billion revenue estimate for 2020, we get the target price of $161.We see the following five catalysts driving the FIS Story:Solid Growth in ePayment Solutions: We see at least 4-5% Y/Y growth in the ePayment segment, driven by billers and financial institution clients. Debit card-based expedited payments should help fuel growth as well, particularly among the company’s largest customers. While ACH processing may be weaker in 2020 than it was in 2019 (we estimate 150-180 bps in Y/Y growth deceleration), we believe that the debit segment should outweigh any such softness.Continued Strength in Digital and Mobile Payments Segments: We do not see meaningful acceleration in either of these segments, but if they can sustain the average 6-7% Y/Y revenue growth we have seen over the last two years, then FIS’ Integrated Financial Solutions segment should be in solid shape. Recall, FIS is now also offering Digital One, a digital banking platform, to community bank clients. Digital One will be integrated into the company’s core banking platforms and will also be offered to non-FIS core banking clients.Double-Digit Consulting Growth Remains a Major Tailwind: Ever since FIS purchased the European consulting Capco business, this growth story kept on accelerating. We believe that, in 2020-21, we can expect to see as much as 12% Y/Y average revenue growth, as FIS takes some market share from Capgemini and Accenture, particularly around the mobile segment.SG&A Cost Cuts to Continue: FIS has been strategically cutting some of its operating expenses (SG&A) over the last several years, a trend that we expect to continue and add at least 45-60 bps to the company’s EPS growth. In our view, such gradual cost-cutting approach is much smarter (and also preemptive!) than a large scale restructuring.Great Capital Return Story: Historically, FIS has been very generous with both buybacks and dividends, returning as much as 90% of its free cash flows annually back to the shareholders. Over the years, FIS averaged approximately 1.1% dividend yield and at least $500-600 MM in buybacks. For 2019-20, we expect the dividend yield to stay the same, while buybacks may increase by as much as $200 MM. We also expect the company to increase the authorization by at least half a billion.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact for the business at FIS:1. Security breaches could harm the FIS business, disrupting delivery of services and resulting in a breach of client contracts.2. Global economic macro conditions may adversely impact consumer confidence and thus lead to lower demand of the company’s services.3. More intense regulatory environment, both domestically and internationally, may lead to an increase in costs and thus impact the company’s bottom line.4. The sales and implementation cycles for software can be lengthy and require significant investment from the company’s clients. If there are interruptions along this implementation cycle, then the processes can be impacted along the way."

When we apply the multiple of 24x to our 2020 EPS estimate of $6.71, we get the target price of $161.See International Growth In Double Digits, Helped By Latin America: We believe that the delta between international and domestic growth rates remains at roughly 700-800 bps, as new contracts from abroad continue to outweigh moderate saturation that began impacting revenue from some of FIS’s larger clients.Debit Growth To Offset Pockets Of Softness In ACH Processing: We estimate a 3.7% Y/Y growth in debit services, which should comfortably offset the -1.5% Y/Y decline we are projecting for ACH. We note that the debit strength is almost entirely driven by new accounts, which have been materializing over the last two quarters. There should be some positive tailwinds on the margin end as well. As for the e-Payment segment, we expect it to grow fairly in line with prior quarters, generating low-single digits in 3Q.Estimate 11% Y/Y Revenue Growth In The Capco Business: While Capco is not a direct competitor to Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Capgemini (OTCPK:CAPMF), EPAM (NYSE:EPAM) and other Europe-based consulting firms, we nonetheless see some market share capture for FIS in 2017-2018 that began to deliver tailwinds in 2019. We believe that our 11% revenue growth estimate is fairly conservative and will look forward to any further color that FIS can provide on the earnings call. (Note: The company doesn’t formally guide to Capco revenue and rarely breaks it down.)Continued Strength In Digital And Mobile Payments Segments: We do not see meaningful acceleration in either of these segments during the third or subsequent quarters, but if they can sustain the average 6-7% Y/Y revenue growth we have seen over the last two years, then FIS’s Integrated Financial Solutions segment should be in solid shape.European Expenses Likely In Check: We expect the European-driven marketing and administrative expenses to moderately decline during 3Q, as the company seeks to further boost the bottom line after several years of solid investments.Seeking Greater Clarity On Acquisition Strategy: Having grown historically via large deals, as well as tuck-ins, we expect FIS to provide an acquisition roadmap of a kind for 2020-21, since there have been fairly conflicting commentaries on that front and it’s not immediately clear what percentage of free cash flows the company plans to annually channel toward the M&A activity.Investment Profile Remains Strong: We reiterate our Buy thesis, as the investment profile for FIS remains solid. Namely, FIS 1) has 80%+ in recurring revenue, which translates into mid single-digit top line Y/Y growth, 2) adheres to low teens EPS growth, supported by shrewd SG&A management, and 3) returns at least 3% back to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, channeling as much as 70-90% of free cash flows toward capital return.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the business at FIS:1. Security breaches could harm FIS's business, disrupting delivery of services and resulting in a breach of client contracts.2. Global economic macro conditions may adversely impact consumer confidence and thus lead to lower demand for the company’s services.3. More intense regulatory environment, both domestically and internationally, may lead to an increase in costs and thus impact the company’s bottom line.4.

4366140,102170,2020-08-07T20:28:10-04:00,"Strong growth and EBITDA margin expansion are notable positives.Organic growth was non existent, but management has reasons to see that improve.The balance sheet and liquidity are solid and should provide comfort to investors.","I wrote an article on Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) that can be found here. FIS has experienced strong growth and cash flow generations. However, with COVID-19 and the shelter-in-place mandate, 1Q20 financial performance was below expectations. Management came out and owned the underwhelming performance and set to fix operations to improve efficiencies and pour money into R&D to improve their products and services for their customers. What I am curious to learn from this unboxing is what is the updated run rate revenue and expense synergies, how did the Merchant Services segment perform, and see if management dropped any guidance hints, especially margin expansion. Perhaps, we will find some other tidbits along the way.Coming into 2020, management guided for organic growth of ~7% and revenues to range between $13.6Bn and $23.7Bn. As with the majority of companies, FIS was negatively impacted by COVID-19, and 1Q20 financial performance was under guidance.In some aspects, financial performance was good, and management deserves credit for this. Other areas were not so hot, especially with the seven percent decline in organic growth. The improvement in revenue and EBITDA was largely due to Worldpay, and that is fine. Investors want the revenue and EBITDA contribution, but they also want other parts of the business to grow as well. That is why 2020 was filled with such high hopes. The money they put into technology and the reshaping of their products and services, along with the Worldpay acquisition, made 2020 the year of FIS.Source: 2Q20 Earnings PresentationManagement has been talking for some time about both revenue ($200MM in FY20) and cost synergies ($600MM in FY20) related to the Worldpay acquisition and has done a good job achieving those synergies. During the 1Q20 conference call, management found an additional $300MM in savings that could be delivered by the end of 2020.Management continues to execute on their synergy plan during the second quarter.Source: 2Q20 Earnings PresentationGary Norcross, CEO explains:It is further noted in the press release that they are ahead of schedule to meet or exceed the planned revenue and expense synergies for Worldpay. I think this will be important for investors because it shows that management has the skill to achieve what they set out to do and were able to execute their plans when the world was turned upside down.As shown early in the quick review section, Merchant Services had a strong quarter until an investor takes a closer work. All the improvement was due to the Worldplay acquisition. In fact, it was held back by poor organic performance. The following is from the 2Q20 Press Release:I guess this was expected even though I had my fingers crossed. There has been improvement seen as the quarter progressed.Source: 2Q20 Earnings PresentationWe are out of the depths on this one, and there is improvement. It is also noted that July has shown improvement too. As an investor, I like what I see. It makes me think that there is an opportunity to get in before more people catch on that Q3 and FY20 could be better than expected.Right off the bat, it is explained that adjusted EBITDA margins for the second quarter expanded 150bps from 37.5% to 39% largely due to the contribution from Worldpay. It would have been higher if the Merchant Services segment was not such a drag.Margins should continue to improve with the often-mentioned synergies. Additionally, FIS is winning long-term SaaS contracts and increasing recurring revenue streams especially in the banking segment. This product mix is favorable because it carries higher margins. Management plays a little coy in the conference call, but along with the higher margins, these business verticals should allow the company to drive 7%-9% organic revenue growth in a post-COVID-19 environment.An analyst asked about margin expectations in the conference call, and Gary Norcross delivered great news:Although I was not overly concerned with the state of the balance sheet and liquidity, it is always good to check under the hood. The following table is from the Q2'20 earnings deck.There is sufficient liquidity, the cost of debt is low, and the leverage ratio is moderate. This should improve with an increase in EBITDA and continued debt pay-downs. I am also happy to see that they still guide for leverage to decline to 2.7x in FYE21. During the 1Q20 conference call, management reiterated that leverage goal, so it is nice to see they are sticking with it and not pushing it back. If they did push it back, that would be understandable. Keeping it should give investors confidence in management's confidence in the near-term performance.The chart below is the price action over the last five trading days.Data by YChartsWhen I look at this chart, it makes me think that investors do not know how to approach this company. Yes, there is good stuff with improvement in merchant volumes, booking new customers in favorable verticals, and strong Worldpay performance. On the other hand, Merchant Services is still a drag and organic growth is non-existent.The 52-week high is $158 per share. I am more bullish on FIS than I was before the earnings release. Management is guiding for higher margins, they are setting up for higher organic growth in the 7-9% range, and there is improvement in Merchant Services segment. The risks are continued trouble in the Merchant Services, slowing in revenue from their higher-margin business verticals (highly competitive business) and slowing of the integration of Worldpay. When I take a look at the risks and rewards, I am definitely on the bullish side. I think $158 is a near-term target, and investors need to digest the information before it goes higher."
4250884,25120,2019-03-25T15:11:27-04:00,"FIS and Worldpay are combining their operations and are eating the lunch of the banks.Both companies have a great track record of dealmaking in the payment space as valuations are quite steep.I would not dare to bet against this combination just yet given the great prospects and track record, although I fear that competition will hurt margins in the long run.","Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and Worldpay (WP) more or less shocked the payment and wider banking industry as they announced a deal in which they would merge their operations, thereby creating a giant in (e-commerce) payments and financial service technologies.While the deal looks quite rich, as Worldpay is quite a bit smaller than FIS, it is growing rapidly, and synergies look quite compelling. The deal multiples are quite rich, and while I do not expect the current fat margins to be sustained forever, I would be hesitant to bet again FIS and this combination just yet, as both have an excellent dealmaking and growth track record.FIS and Worldpay have reached a deal to combine their operations, with FIS being the remaining entity and shareholders of Worldpay being entitled to 0.9287 shares of FIS as well as a complementary cash payment equal to $11 per share. Shareholders of FIS will own 53% of the combined company as the deal values Worldpay at a massive $43 billion at an enterprise level, thus including net debt.The deal is driven by overlap and synergies, as both FIS and Worldpay have complementary solutions and services which include issuer services, network and merchant services, and loyalty and fraud detection services. Both companies have been quite proactive on their own with regards to innovation, as seen in the truly impressive long-term share price performances of both companies. And in particular, Worldpay has benefited handsomely from the emergence of e-commerce and now processes over 40 billion transactions across the globe and through different platforms each year.Both companies recognise the need for scale in a globalising world, due to the large IT investments that need to be made. Scale, greater offerings and greater reach should benefit the combined entity, which is expected to benefit from organic growth as well; seen at 6-9% through 2021. Combined synergies from a revenue and expense standpoint are pegged at $700 million a year in terms of EBITDA, quite significant of course, with a prominent share of those synergies coming from additional revenues.Halfway through February, FIS reported its 2018 results. The company reported revenues of $8.4 billion with organic growth coming in just above 2%. It is very profitable with adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 billion for margins of 37%, and adjusted earnings were reported at $1.7 billion.The 332 million outstanding shares of FIS traded at $109 per share ahead of the deal for a $36.2 billion equity valuation. Including $8.2 billion in net debt, the enterprise valuation amounts to $44.4 billion.The story for Worldpay is a bit different, as it reported its 2018 results two weeks later. The story itself is a bit complicated as Worldpay has been created through the purchase of Worldpay by Vantiv early in 2018. Revenues increased by 85% to $3.9 billion following that deal, with organic growth coming in around 10%. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion as its EBITDA margins came in as high as 49%, and adjusted earnings came in at $1.25 billion. Both numbers have kindly adjusted for some $125 million in stock-based compensation expenses, among others.Take into account the net debt of $7.4 billion, 308 million shares outstanding, and a valuation of roughly $112 per share, the enterprise value of Worldpay comes in at around $42 billion, just a billion less than what has been reported in the press release, as this is really a 50/50 deal.That is not really the case if we look at the pro forma business with $12.4 billion in revenues and $4.9 billion in EBITDA reported by the combined business. FIS itself is responsible for about 2/3 of revenues and 60% of EBITDA, although it is growing at a much more modest pace of course.Absence a market reaction to the deal announcement, the combined market value comes in around $86 billion according to the calculations above. This is for a business with roughly $5 billion in EBITDA, as this number excludes $700 million in projected synergies.I pegged the net debt at $15.6 billion ahead of the $11 per share payment for shareholders of Worldpay. That payment comes in at $3.4 billion for a pro-forma net debt load of $19 billion. With EBITDA of $5 billion, that works down to an elevated 3.8 times leverage ratio, although both businesses are very profitable, are growing their operations, and realisation of synergies alone could cut leverage ratios toward 3.3 times.If we kindly and blindly use the adjusted earnings number of both companies, we have a business with $3 billion in adjusted earnings, although this excludes stock-based compensation of course. Since we know that $3.4 billion in net debt will be added to the combined leverage position following the cash payment to shareholders of Worldpay, we can estimate that interest expenses will increase by some $100 million, resulting in a $2.9 billion adjusted earnings number.The total share count will rise to roughly 625 million, which results in adjusted earnings of around $4.65 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $5.23 per share reported by FIS in 2018; it does not take into account the synergies just yet. Assuming $700 million in synergies will contribute $550 million after incorporating taxes, realising those synergies could boost the earnings number by roughly 80 cents. This results in the accretion being relatively modest, which seems disappointing, as Worldpay is acquired at a premium valuation, and the promise of this deal is that of much greater growth.One has to understand that mega deals in the wider payment space have taken place in the industry and in most cases both players have played an active role. FIS has acquired Metavante in a +$4 billion deal in 2009 and bought SunGard in 2015 for more than $9 billion. Worldpay acquired Mercury in 2014 for nearly $2 billion as Vantiv acquired Worldpay just a year ago for more than $10 billion. In each of these transactions, synergies have been achieved ahead of the initial plans, as the long-term share price performance of both firms shows that this strategy has been value enhancing for long-term shareholders.Through 2021, the combination expects a healthy growth and sees sales increasing to $15 billion with EBITDA as high as $6.5-7.0 billion, creating a real profit machine.While the lack of a positive response to the deal announcement could be explained by the relatively high purchase price for Worldpay (in relation to the sales and earnings being contributed), reality is that synergies look compelling, as Worldpay is really the growth engine in this tie-up. This could explain the lack of real reaction in the share price of FIS, yet we have to give management the benefit of the doubt given the long-term outperformance.Trading at $110, it goes without saying that multiples are relatively elevated at 23-24 times current earnings and 20 times earnings once synergies are accounted for, while leverage ratios will shoot up quite dramatically as well.While I appreciate the growth in the international and e-commerce payment space, one has to wonder if these very fat margins can be sustained. While names like FIS and Worldpay might be eating the lunch of the banks, one has to wonder if their lunch gets eaten by new names likes Square (NYSE:SQ) or PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) at some point as well, or at least margins will come under pressure.To put it this way, management has certainly some credibility on the back of the great track record, yet I am in no rush to chase shares of FIS here as the deal multiples are high, and synergy estimates look ambitious. I will not rule out a compression of the very fat 40-50% EBITDA margins projected currently for the future. While I would not dare betting against the company, and I appreciate the rationale for combining operations, I am not big fan of the stock here despite a great track record."

The deal is being touted as good for shareholders since it will produce revenue and cost synergies and combine a top Fintech company with a Merchant Services Provider. There are several key aspects of this deal which make it quite suitable for a merger arbitrage play.The Deal Has Value. FIS shareholders will end up owning 53% of the company and have 7 of the 12 board seats. FIS is keeping its name on the combined company. FIS is paying just a 14% premium to WP's pre-merger stock price.Source: WorldPay Investor Relations Presentation ""FIS + WorldPay: Accelerating Finance and Commerce""FIS is paying about 10x Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue and 24x EV/EBITDA for WP. The sector average is about 6x EV/Revenue and 35x EV/EBITDA. This can be seen in the following tables:Source: HakeFIS actually sells at a lower valuation than WP:Source: HakeManagement estimates there will be significant gains in revenue, cash flow, and balance sheet strength:Source: WorldPay Investor Relations Presentation ""FIS + WorldPay: Accelerating Finance and Commerce""That is all well and good, but I am a skeptic. The reality is that FIS is paying twice its own valuation. Here is what the combined company looks like, in terms of valuation, assuming the synergies don't emerge.Source: HakeThat is a nice hat trick for FIS. The deal effectively raises its own valuation ratios. Before the merger, FIS traded for 5.3x sales, and now on a 2018 combined basis (without synergy estimates), FIS/WP has a 6.5x ratio. Before the merger FIS traded at 14.5x EV/EBITDA, and now combined it is at 16.4x.Management says the synergies between the two will raise revenue by 25% in three years from $12.3 billion to $15 billion, increase Adjusted EBITDA by almost 38% and almost double free cash flow from $2.4 billion to $4.5 billion:Source: HakeSo, in effect, the combined company will be cheaper with the synergies. I guess that makes it a value proposition. It helps the ""story."" The story is important to merger arb players because the deal needs to close and if the story is believable and acceptable to shareholders the deal closes on time.Keep in mind that these metrics are significantly below the industry metrics. This can be seen in the following spreadsheet:Source: Hake estimatesFor example, the industry trades at 34.5x EV/EBITDA and 6.3x EV/Sales, whereas the deal envisioned here on a 2018 combined basis w/o synergies is at 6.5x EV/Sales and 16.5x EV/EBITDA. The latter ratio is significantly lower than the industry.Deal Certainty. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019, based on what management said in its presentation and on the conference call. That is six to nine months from now. WorldPay and FIS have made numerous acquisition in the past several years, as they pointed out in their presentation:Source: Investor Presentation (see above).WorldPay's last deal, its purchase of Vantiv in August 2017 closed in January of 2018, or 5 months later. So it looks like WP can close its deals on time.Source: HakeFor purposes of our merger arb calculations, I believe the deal is highly likely to close in six months, and certainly no later than nine months.The Arb Math Works.Here is the arithmetic:Source: HakeIn summary, if the deal closes in six months, the return to someone who buys WP stock right now, waits until the deal closes, collects the $11 per share in cash at the merger close and owns FIS stock worth $105.04 (at today's FIS price), is $2.54, or 2.23%. If the merger arb investor could duplicate this return in another six month period, the annualized return is 4.45%.Risk-Adjusted Return. Let's say there is a 10% chance the deal does not close and that as a result, the investor's purchase of WP falls 10%. Then the expected return, on an annualized basis is lower at 3.07%.Source: HakeThat is not very likely, but at least it is profitable. In fact, the probability of the deal not closing would have to be less than 35% for the merger arb opportunity to stay profitable under this scenario. This is a very high threshold level for the risk of the deal to not occur:Source: HakeAlright. So much for risk adjustments. It's a little too academic. What we know is we can make 4.5% annualized on the purchase of WP shares and there is a high likelihood the deal will close and we will receive FIS shares and cash. How can we leverage or spike those returns given this good arb math?1. Short Long Dated In-The-Money Calls on a Covered Basis.Because the arb player will be owning WP shares as part of the merger arb play, he can also short August 2019 calls and collect some money (premium) while waiting for the deal to close. This is a sort of pseudo dividend. Here is the WP option chain as of close Friday, March 29, 2019:Source: MarketWatch: Stock Market News - Financial News - Go to WP and the options chain link.So the proceeds from $105 WP calls due August 16, 2019, will give the arb player $9.80 at the bid price as of Friday, March 29, 2019. Here is the math:Source: HakeI included the borrowing and margin cost so the net return $7.49 on a total cost of $108.55 per share, and the ROI is now 6.90%, which is also 14.3% on an annualized basis. This is a bit optimistic. It assumes the WP shares will be held until the merger the August expiration and that the merger close will happen after that.Since the calls are shorted in-the-money, there is a high likelihood the calls will be exercised and the arb player will have to sell the WP shares at $105 per share before the deal closes. In fact, the August expiration is before the possible September close of the deal. In that case, we assume the arb player could purchase more WP at the same $113.50 price per share as today. Here is what is more likely to occur:Source: HakeInstead of completing the merger arb, the arb player's in-the-money WP options are likely to be exercised in 3 months or earlier. He has to sell his WP shares at $105 but gets to keep the $9.80 option premium received at the beginning of the short. He makes $1.30 per share on a cost of $103.70. So the net return over 3 months is an annualized ROI of 5.11%. That is still better than the original merger arb return of 4.5% shown earlier.Moreover, the arb player would have received cash and could then re-invest in the merger arb situation with FIS and WP.2. Short Long-Dated Out-of-The-Money Puts for WP.You can make more money with this strategy and it is a little less risky. However, to do it, you have to receive level 3 options clearance at your broker-dealer and have at least $25K or more in your account. Here is how it works:Source: MarketWatch: Stock Market News - Financial NewsThe arb player shorts the out-of-the-money August 2019 puts with an exercise price of $105 per share for WP. This is well below (7.5%) today's WP price of $113.50 per share, so the short puts are not likely to be exercised before the deal closes. The short put premium received is $0.75 share at the bid price. Here is the math:Source: This is much better than the 4.5% annualized ROI with a straight merger arb. Theoretically, if the stock price fell below $105 (somehow, but extremely not likely) before the close, the put options would be exercised and the arb player would have to buy WP shares at $105 and then surrender them at the merger close. It is not clear what the FIS shares would be trading at, but assuming the FIS shares still traded at today's price, here is the ROI math:Source: HakeThis is not likely to happen, so don't count on it. There is a third option strategy, which could be done in conjunction with either the WP short call and put strategies.3. Short Long-Dated FIS Out-of-the-Money (OTM) Calls.Short the Dec. 2019 $120 FIS calls, which are OTM calls. Here is the option chain as of March 29, 2019:Source: MarketWatch: Stock Market News - Financial NewsThe arb player would make the following investments:(1) an in-the-money covered call investment (as seen above), which (2) is called early, and (3) the arb player re-invests in the WP shares at today's price, and (4) the investor simultaneously with the covered call investment, shorts $120 Dec. 2019 FIS calls for $5.25 per share:Source: HakeThe FIS shares received by the WP investor at the merger close would have been produced a $9.09 profit, or 20% annualized over 6 months. If the FIS received as part of the merger are then exercised by December expiration, the annualized return is 25%.Alternatively, if we shorted OTM FIS calls and also shorted OTM WP puts, here is the potential return:Source: HakeNote these returns are slightly lower than the combination short WP in-the-money call (then exercised) and rebought WP plus short FIS out-of-the-money call strategy mentioned above.4. Short OTM WP Calls, OTM WP Puts, and OTM FIS Calls.Here we short the Aug $120 WP calls (along with the other OTM WP short put and OTM short FIS call strategies above). Below is the Aug 2019 call option chain for OTM WP calls, as of 3-29-19:Source: MarketWatch: Stock Market News - Financial NewsHere is how the math works:Source: HakeSo this option uses all out-of-the-money options. The potential return is 24% if the FIS shares received as a result of the merger are exercised at $120. Even though this ROI is slightly lower than the in-the-money WP returns above, the fact that all of the options are out-of-the-money makes it more likely the return will be achieved as shown.The merger is likely to be closed in 6 months. Here are five arb strategies:1. Buy WP shares, wait for the merger to close: Annualized ROI - 4.50%2. Short in-the-money (ITM) covered WP calls. Likely exercised. Annualized ROI - 5.11%.3. Short Out-of-the-money WP puts, along with long WP purchase: Annualized ROI - 14.5%.4. Short ITM covered WP calls, rebuy, and short OTM FIS calls. Annualized ROI - 19.8%. If OTM FIS calls are exercised, ROI - 25.1%.5. Short OTM WP calls, buy WP shares, short OTM WP puts, short OTM FIS calls (longer dated than WP calls and puts shorted): Annualized ROI - 18.3%, and if the OTM FIS calls are exercised, ROI - 24.2%.The last two strategies are best. Personally, I like only shorting out-of-the-money options, as they so much less likely to get exercised, so I highly recommend the last strategy."
4201388,24361,2018-08-22T18:19:36-04:00,"Investors largely shook off a mixed Q2 earnings report from FIS as enthusiasm for fintech names remains high and FIS delivered better performance in IFS and overall margins.Bank IT outsourcing remains underpenetrated, particularly among larger banks, and IT spending needs are growing - making for a stronger long-term argument for going with FIS.The market seems to already expect a lot of growth out of FIS and I'm worried that high expectations and enthusiasm for fintech are setting the bar too high.","I was fairly lukewarm on FIS (FIS) back in May of this year, and the shares have since risen another 5% or so – keeping pace with the S&P 500 but largely sitting out the strong ongoing run in fintech names, as peers/comps like Jack Henry (JKHY), Worldpay (WP), Fiserv (FISV), and Total System Services (TSS) have shot higher as Wall Street seemingly can’t get enough of the fintech sector growth story.As it concerns FIS, while I like the story of leveraging ongoing growth in bank IT investment, including a growing willingness to outsource as “keeping up with the Morgans” with internally-developed systems becomes prohibitively expensive, I just don’t see the growth here to support a substantially higher share price. Outsourcing among banks could perhaps inflect more strongly than I expect, or FIS could perhaps migrate a bit further down-market from its core Tier 1/Tier 2 bank focus, but this remains a stock where I understand the fundamental drivers but struggle to make more sense of the valuation and expectations.One of the issues/challenges I have with the FIS is that it gets growth stock valuation (a forward PE in the high teens) without growth stock growth. Revenue fell 7% as reported in the second quarter with underlying organic growth of a little under 1%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 1%, as did adjusted operating income, and it has been quite some time since adjusted EBITDA grew by double-digits on an organic basis.Within the revenue number, the Integrated Financial Solutions (or IFS) business saw better than 4% organic growth, with 5% growth in Banking and Wealth and 7% growth in Corp/Digital offsetting 2% growth in Payments. Global Financial Solutions (or GFS) was disappointing, with 3% revenue contraction (a 5% decline in Institutional/Wholesale, and flat Banking/Payments) driven in part by an ASC 606 accounting change, but also a faster transition in the company’s SaaS customer model.Both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating margins improved this quarter, with IFS EBITDA margin improving almost a point on 6% segment-level growth and GFS improving almost four points despite a 7% segment-level contraction.Book-to-bill was above 1 for the quarter, and the company did see backlog growth.Underlying the bull case for FIS is an ongoing IT investment cycle on the part of banks around the world. While there are some banks that are reducing IT spending (mostly after just completing an upgrade/investment cycle), on the whole banks are taking whatever savings they can garner from lower tax rates and reduced branches/headcount and redirecting it into IT spending.There are multiple reasons why. The payments technology space continues to evolve, and banks have to keep up (processing and payment solutions is a very significant part of FIS’s IFS business). At the same time, more and more depositors are getting accustomed to the convenience of online, digital, and mobile banking and demanding increasing functionality, while banks themselves realize that offering more services through digital channels costs money upfront (in terms of the IT systems investments), but saves money longer term, increases depositor stickiness, and can lead to improved cross-selling results.Banks are also finally starting to adopt cloud computing and data analytics in a bigger way, with more and more banks realizing that IT investments to support loan underwriting can pay off in the form of faster lending decisions, more accurate risk segmentation, and more accurate pricing.The question remains how much this will benefit FIS. I’ve seen estimates suggesting that banks will grow their IT spending collectively at a compound rate of over 4% over the next four to five years. How much of that goes to outsourced providers like FIS is a big question. FIS has very strong share among those large banks who do outsource (around 35% overall, and even higher among the largest banks), but only about 20% or so of the largest banks outsource their core IT functions/platforms.I believe the key to the bull argument for FIS rests on that reluctance to outsource changing over the next three to 10 years. JPMorgan (JPM) plans to spend around $11 billion on IT in 2018 alone, with about $5 billion of that going to “strategic” spending. While other large banks like Citigroup (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) can at least stay in the ballpark (with expected 2018 IT spending ranging from around $7 billion to $10 billion), $10 billion roughly approximates U.S. Bancorp’s (USB) entire expected pre-provision operating profit for the year – and U.S. Bancorp is one of the ten largest banks in the country!Said differently, while other banks don’t necessarily have to match JPMorgan dollar for dollar to remain competitive, there are a lot of banks throwing a lot of money at internal IT development, and smaller banks (even “smaller large” banks) simply cannot keep up with that spending. While that does put an onus on FIS to make sure it is spending enough on internal product/system development as well, I believe it does create a significant outsourcing opportunity for banks that know they need to upgrade and modernize their payments, processing, analytics, and back-office IT capabilities, including more robust mobile/digital offerings and more self-service options.The problem is that while the growth opportunity may be there, FIS’s ability to maximize that opportunity is very much still unproven. Say what you like about sell-side forecasting ability, but if anything the sell-side has been too bullish on FIS over the last four years (revenue misses outnumber beats by 13 to 4) and the most ambitious revenue growth rates are in the 4% to 5% area. Likewise, while I’m bullish on FIS’s ability to generate improving margin leverage in the coming years, even something on the order of five points of incremental EBITDA margin leverage (from the mid-30%’s to the low 40%’s) doesn’t come close to driving a double-digit EBITDA growth rate.All of that would be fine but for the expectations. I don’t care if a company grows 2% a year or 20% a year; I’ve made money in both. What I care about is where the level of expectations seem to be set in the market, and it looks like the market is already counting on strong discounted cash flow growth (and that’s even if you exclude capitalized hardware). Likewise with the forward EBITDA multiple that is already in the low double-digits – not completely unreasonable relative to margins, but still not exactly modest relative to growth.I may well be missing something with FIS, but I generally steer clear of stocks where the valuation seems to rest on something I can’t see or quantify. As I have said before, I think FIS is a well-run company serving a growing market with significant potential upside if or when more large banks choose to outsource more of their IT spending. But with multiples and valuation where they are, it seems like a lot of this story rests on bullishness for fintech in general – a theme that could certainly take these shares higher in the short term, but with a much less certain longer-term outcome."
4251279,25047,2019-03-27T10:09:07-04:00,"FIS non-GAAP EPS and resulting multiples are not comparable to anyone else's.This is so because of how the non-GAAP EPS ""comes to be"".Even more amazing is how it came to be that way.","Sometimes, the truth is even stranger than fiction. Fidelity National Information Service's (FIS) non-GAAP reporting is one such time.Non-GAAP EPS reporting is often useful. The concept is that you sometimes have to exclude one-off costs and gains which don't recur, so as to have a better understanding of the underlying (recurring) profitability.These one-off costs and gains can come from anywhere. From tax windfalls to costs such as those sustained to perform an acquisition or to issue debt and equity or costs related with a restructuring. The reasons can be nearly infinite. As I said, the main reason to exclude these is most often the underlying condition and costs/gains do not recur.A second type of cost/gain which often also makes sense to exclude has to do with the nature of the cost/gain. So, if you have a cost/gain whose nature is non-cash in nature and mostly exists because of accounting convention, that cost/gain will also likely make sense to exclude. Think for instance of intangible amortization. Or a goodwill charge.Of course, excluding costs can make non-GAAP EPS seem prettier. It can make the company excluding these costs seem cheaper, from an earnings multiple perspective. The usage of non-GAAP is thus wide open to abuse. It's not a coincidence that:Another example of wildly widespread ""low-grade"" abuse concerns the exclusion of stock-based compensation. Obviously, paying in stock or paying in options, especially when the company turns around and then buys back the shares it issued so as to keep dilution under control is nonsense. In the end, you either have more shares issued or if you paid with shares and then bought them back, you have a situation where materially it's exactly the same as having paid in cash to begin with. Yet, if the company had paid in cash, it wouldn't have excluded the cost in its non-GAAP reporting, and if it pays in shares and buys back the stock, it typically excludes the so-paid compensation in its non-GAAP reporting.First, a cautionary remark: What I am about to say wasn't really prompted by FIS itself. So, do not take what I am about to say as evidence of wrongdoing. More on that later.Now, up until recently, FIS was no different from most other companies out there when it came to non-GAAP reporting. FIS used it and, most notably, excluded things like:All of these are fine and dandy to an extent. For sure, acquisition costs and restructuring charges can be a bit abused. And excluding equity-based compensation is, as I said, low-grade but widespread abuse. If you're going to compare one company's non-GAAP EPS multiple to another, you likely have to accept the exclusion of equity-based compensation (or rework the numbers).That was up until recently. But then something happened. Something truly extraordinary, which sets FIS apart from all other companies out there. It sets it apart to such an extent that you can no longer compare FIS's non-GAAP earnings multiples to anyone else's. So, what happened?Well, instead of just excluding intangible amortization and depreciation, FIS started excluding the entirety of the amortization and depreciation the company reports. I'm not joking here. The FIS non-GAAP EPS you now see, and which forms the basis of the market consensus EPS, excludes all amortization and depreciation recorded by the company. Tangible and intangible.This is, needless to say, crazy. It makes the FIS non-GAAP EPS number be a bloated, unrealistic, and useless number. Any multiples calculated on this non-GAAP EPS are worthless.So, how did this happen?The way that worthless non-GAAP EPS came to be is stranger than fiction. Ordinarily, you'd think FIS has just gone out on a branch to put lipstick on its non-GAAP EPS. But no.What happened was rather more prosaic. It went like this:I cannot for the life of me understand how this could come to be. Perhaps the particular staff on the SEC side was junior to how non-GAAP reporting is commonly handled on the Street today. To conflate EBITDA, an attempt at a measure of operating cash generation potential, with non-GAAP EPS, an attempt at underlying earnings generation, and exclude all amortization makes no sense.Amortization is an accounting construct used to spread the costs of acquiring an asset throughout its economic life. In the case of FIS, a lot of these assets are capitalized software costs. They're very real costs. Yet, in saying that, FIS can exclude all such depreciation, the SEC is basically saying that this particular company need not account for the cost of the assets it needs to run its business. It makes no sense.Yet, there you have it. This is how the strangest non-GAAP EPS in the entire market came to be.There are several conclusions to be drawn here.This boggles the mind."
4175918,24361,2018-05-21T14:17:50-04:00,"FIS has seen some recent improvements in organic growth, but the margin leverage has been more impressive.FIS should be a partner of choice in an increasingly competitive bank IT investment environment, but coaxing larger banks to outsource isn't an easy proposition.FIS can use margin leverage to drive double-digit growth from here, but the share price largely factors that in already.","Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) has been a so-so performer since my last update on the company in August of 2017. Although the shares are up around 10% since then, slightly better than the S&P 500, the shares have lagged Fiserv (FISV) and Jack Henry (JKHY). I believe this underperformance is due at least in part to FIS's slow pace of organic growth and the challenges the company faces in accelerating that growth to a meaningful degree.Providing banking and payments technology to banks and other financial institutions remains a good business on balance, and FIS has opportunities to drive further margin leverage and/or pursue value-additive M&A. Even so, the total return potential here looks somewhat lackluster, suggesting the shares are an okay hold but not an especially exciting buy candidate.The last few quarters have seen FIS deliver on its primary driver of expanding margins, as the company has done a good job of integrating SunGard, driving improved operating efficiency, and paring away lower-margin businesses (like consulting).While revenue declined on an as-reported basis in the first quarter, organic revenue was up a little more than 3%, better than expected and the second quarter in a row of accelerating organic revenue growth. Global Financial Solutions led the way with over 5% growth, as the company's Institutional & Wholesale business grew 6% and the Banking & Payments business grew almost 5%. Integrated Financial Solutions was slower-growing (up a little more than 3%) as a decline in the Payments segment weighed down almost 6% growth in Banking & Wealth and Corporate & Digital.Margin leverage has been one of the most potent potential drivers for FIS, and that leverage is coming through a little better than expected. Gross margin improved more than 2%, with non-GAAP operating income and adjusted EBITDA rising 2% and 3%, respectively, with almost four points of EBITDA margin expansion.Management sounded relatively confident that growth would accelerate in the second half of the year, as the company has been logging some solid business wins that will show up in revenue later this year. That fits the general theme of the company's recent Investor Day, where management laid out a case for some modest revenue growth acceleration in the coming years. All of that said, investors should note that the next quarter (the second quarter) will likely be weaker on a revenue growth basis.In some respects, FIS is addressing attractive markets that should be able to support years of growth. The company can provide banks with a host of core banking technology offerings, including processing, payments, lending, asset/wealth management, and risk/compliance. Card issuance/processing remains a significant growth opportunity; there are relatively few larger banks out there that aren't interested in growing their card businesses, and FIS can offer a lot on the IT back-office side.FIS also has meaningful opportunities in payments, mobile, and digital retail banking. Payments technology is getting more and more complicated as the number of payment technologies expands and customers demand increasingly fast processing times. Mobile banking and digital retail banking in general are also becoming must-have's - not only does offering more automated solutions reduce operating expenses for banks, but customers are increasingly expecting to be able to do a wide range of banking business through their phones and PCs.FIS benefits from scale and the increasing cost of IT innovation. As I mentioned recently in a piece on JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), JPMorgan is spending more on banking IT than the tenth through hundredth largest banks in the U.S. combined. Likewise, other large banks like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) continue to invest considerable sums into IT development. At some point, then, it is very difficult for banks outside the top 20 to compete - they simply cannot throw as many dollars at IT as the larger banks, but customers aren't going to give them a break just because they're smaller. FIS can step in, then, and offer banks a better option - using FIS is typically more expensive on a year-to-year basis than a wholly-owned/developed system, but FIS's customers don't have to make the upfront investments.The ""but"" is that FIS targets larger banks and larger banks are still much less likely to outsource than their smaller peers who don't have as much choice, given the economics and access to talent. Client wins can be significant for FIS, given the size of the banks they seek to serve, but fewer than 25% of the largest banks outsource significant amounts of their IT needs. Increasingly complex IT needs and regulation may spur more adoption of outsourced solutions in the coming years, but ""may"" is a tricky word.While revenue growth is likely never going to be torrid, FIS is pursuing additional opportunities to improve margins. The company will be consolidating data centers by about a third in a move that could save $250M/year by the end of 2021. The company is also looking to modernize legacy systems and pursue innovation in cloud infrastructure and open API architecture that should ultimately support better margins down the road.Given some of the adjustments management has made to the business, my revenue growth assumptions are now lower than they were at the time of my last article, but the offsetting margin adjustments more than offset this. I believe FIS will find it difficult to exceed 3% to 4% growth on an organic basis, but I do believe adjusted FCF margins can move into the high 20%s relatively soon (within three years), supporting double-digit FCF growth.I don't believe FIS shares are expensive, but they look priced for a long-term annualized return on the lower side of high single digits (7% to 8%). That's okay for a hold, particularly when the company does have some opportunities to exceed expectations on revenue and margins, but it isn't enough to coax me to as bullish as I was a year ago."
4283217,104952,2019-08-08T11:43:36-04:00,"FIS's acquisition of Worldpay provides investors access to the full life-cycle of the financial technology market ranging from core banking transaction to online payment processing globally.FIS and Worldpay combined would generate an estimated total of $12 billion annual revenue and more than $120 billion market cap.With a relatively optimistic post-acquisition guidance for Q3 and Q4 and a high P/E ratio of 45-51, there is an expectation of both successful integration with potential future acquisitions being priced in.","We think that Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) has made a major strategic move in acquiring Worldpay (NYSE:WP) for $43 billion recently, which presents an interesting upside opportunity for technology investors to receive exposure beyond the financial services technology market. In a nutshell, FIS pre-Worldpay acquisition is pretty much the largest core banking software provider for many large financial institutions.FIS made the Worldpay acquisition just about a year after Vantiv (VNTV) acquired Worldpay and decided to change its name to Worldpay. With the acquisition, FIS also enables itself to tap into Vantiv’s strength. Vantiv itself is another payment technology player that has made a reputation as one of the few technology companies with a strong ability to execute M&A deals. Over the years, M&A has been the key avenue for it to grow and achieve the number 1 position in the US in terms of total processed volume of credit card transactions.(Source: Worldpay 10-K Filing. History of Investment and Acquisition by Vantiv)Over the last year, we have learned that in addition to the positive views surrounding the deal, it appears that the operational integration has progressed very well. In the Q3 2018 earnings call, the management expected to quadruple the already-achieved total cost synergies of $50 million in 2020.In regards to Worldpay’s acquisition by FIS, Q3 2019 will be the first quarter that FIS reports a consolidated quarterly revenue from both companies. Recently in Q2 2019, FIS’s guidance for the combined revenue from FIS and Worldpay for FY 2019 would be somewhere around $12 billion. In our view, there will not be any significant post-merger issues in terms of revenue generation for both companies. As it stands, FIS is a pretty stable business as a standalone. It is a financial services technology firm with $80 billion market capitalization that in the last 3 years has been generating around $8 billion in revenue that has been growing around 2% YoY. As a standalone, FIS itself is a large-cap company already with a steady stream of recurring revenue coming from their IFS (Integrated Financial Services) and GFS (Global Financial Services) segments. The main asset of FIS is its software applications, which are used by many large financial institutions primarily to store their customer records.(Source: FIS 10-Q Filing Q2 2019. FIS Revenue Stream by Types and Geographical Markets)FIS mainly generated 60% to 70% of its revenue through processing and service transaction fees incurred by its clients from both segments, while the clients themselves include North American and Global banks, government institutions, credit unions, commercial lenders, and others. An interesting thing about FIS from our point of view as technology investors is the fact that it has built a very high barrier to entry in the market where the switching cost is also really high for over 50 years. Such a critical moat proves important for the company to be able to build a steady and recurring revenue stream through predictable purchase patterns of its clients.With such an established and large client base, we have seen that it would make sense for a very profitable and cash-rich business like FIS to focus its growth strategy towards acquiring new businesses with similar business models in other areas of the financial software market.(Source: Stockrow. FIS Revenue growth Trailing Annual)Over the last 2 years before the Worldpay acquisition, FIS’s revenue growth had remained between the 1%-3% YoY range, which also created an urgency to seek an acquisition target to boost its growth and also create a cost and revenue synergy.(Source: Stockrow. Worldpay Revenue, growth, and Cash Flow)We think that Worldpay’s acquisition will provide FIS with a good opportunity to achieve both due to its similarity in business model and Worldpay/Vantiv’s history of successful M&A deal executions. In FY 2018, Worldpay was acquired by Vantiv and kept its brand name as the surviving company after the deal, during which it spent almost the rest of the year realizing cost synergies. With a realized cost synergy of almost $50 million a year and expected revenue synergy of $100 million, the merger turned out to be successful. Worldpay grew at a slightly higher rate at 2.42% YoY than FIS, and it also was a cash-rich and profitable company with annual revenue of $3.8 billion-$4 billion.(Source: Seeking Alpha. FIS’ Worldpay reporting segment Q2 2019)In general, Worldpay’s core business is to provide a payment gateway solution for online and offline merchants and also a processing solution for credit card issuers, which in the majority are financial institutions. Given both companies sharing a very similar fee-based business model out of providing core software applications for large institutions in different markets, we expect that FIS will be able to realize various operating cost synergies on mostly SG&A expenses. Besides, FIS will also now be able to tap into the double-digit growth technology business segment Worldpay has and the $2 trillion global eCommerce and terminal (offline) payment gateway solutions.It is not a secret that any M&A deal comes with a high risk of failure. On a more positive note, the fact that Worldpay and FIS businesses share a similarity in how both generate revenue would mean a huge step forward towards achieving synergy in how both management think of the combined company’s future strategies.That being said, one thing that caught our attention despite Worldpay’s successful merger with Vantiv in 2018 was how greatly impacted its profitability was during that year.(Source: StockRow. Worldpay Expenses in FY 2018 vs FY 2017)We found that in order to successfully complete the post-acquisition integration, Worldpay had to spend almost twice as much SG&A and operating expense as it did in the previous year to realize the synergies. Most of these costs, as reported in Worldpay’s 10-K, were spent in transaction, consulting and third-party service fees.(Source: Stockrow)This impacted Worldpay’s bottom line by a lot. In 2018, Worldpay was only able to record a net margin of 0.3%, which for a company of Worldpay’s scale was much lower compared to 3.8% in 2017. At the same time, revenue was also affected, though not as severe, with it being down almost 2.9% YoY.Going into Q3 2019, where it would report its first-ever actual consolidated results post-acquisition, FIS would have to pay attention to the factors driving such integration costs as they would be going into Q3 with most investors expecting it to have taken notes and learned from Vantiv’s acquisition of Worldpay and proceed with more caution.(Source: Google finance. FIS last 1-month historical price per share performance)The market has so far viewed the acquisition quite positively as of Q2 2019. Given a strong Q2, currently, FIS trades at $129.95 per share with a P/S of 4.37 and P/E ratio of 51 as of Q2, the highest it has been in the last 5 quarters. The dip due to mostly trade war news affecting the broader market could actually provide a good buying opportunity given the upsides we have discussed previously. The guidance for the next quarter of $2.78 billion-$2.8 billion Q3 revenue and adjusted EPS, excluding all depreciation and amortization, of $1.69 - $1.72, seems to be more on the optimistic side given there is a risk of one-off depressed earnings due to the cost incurred for integrations.As a large-cap company, the combined operation between Worldpay and FIS would generate a revenue of almost $12 billion a year and a market cap of more than $120 billion. On the growth perspective, it might seem that a lot would be needed to really move the needle. To us, the Worldpay acquisition is a major step towards that.(Source: Seeking Alpha. FIS 2019 Q2 Earnings Call Slides)With the revenue synergy driving an additional 1% to 3% growth rate, we feel that this would still be an interesting opportunity for technology investors to receive exposure to the broader global financial technology market. With total combined assets of almost $50 billion and consistent free cash flow generation at $1.3 billion annually, we believe that it would be possible for FIS to do more acquisitions by FY 2020 once the current operating integration is fully complete."

The company has an EV/S of 3.6X and it has a P/E, based on the consensus views of 19 analysts who post earnings estimates, at about 18.5X. Neither of those are dirt cheap, but this is a healthy company, and one rarely finds deep value in the universe of well-followed healthy companies.While this company doesn't always beat estimates, operating results usually exceed consensus projections. Over the course of the last several months, estimates have increased some. The shares are not terribly volatile. They do react to earnings, of course. After Q1 results were released, the shares appreciated by 12% over the next 10 trading days. When the Brexit results were released, the company's shares pulled back by 10% before making back that pullback in the last few trading days.Looking back a bit further, an investment in FIS's shares would have been more than a bit satisfactory. Over the past five years, the shares have appreciated 155%. This year, so far, has been no exception to that trend. The shares are up by more than 20%. Part of that increase has been a snapback from the 18% share price loss after the announcement of Q3 2015 earnings, which showed a year-on-year revenue decline coupled with a small EPS miss.FIS recently acquired SunGard, which was one of the largest software vendors in the financial services vertical. The company pays a dividend, but the dividend that it pays is puny. It has a high level of free cash flow and some of it is being used to repurchase shares. But the company has a stated goal of de-levering its balance sheet.I usually like to look at companies with strong growth or at least prospective strong growth. And I like to look at companies with a bit of controversy so that the shares have room to appreciate. This company is not going to achieve strong organic growth. It has loads of competitors, most of its markets are highly fragmented, and there are simply few new customers in what appears to be a saturated market.Analysts are quite positive regarding the name. There have been at least six upgrades in the last several months, mainly due to the strong Q1 the company reported. FIS may not have the strongest organic growth outlook, but its skills as a consolidator are and have been on display and that will drive EPS growth for the foreseeable future. The issue for me is the current state of macro headwinds and uncertainties. This wouldn't be the moment in which I would recommend the initiation of new positions, although the outlook for the longer term remains very positive.The company is not terribly exposed to the EU economy. Indeed, even in the wake of the SunGard merger, this company gets just around 25% of its revenues from its international exposure.The biggest risk, at least as I see it, is the company's exposure to the banking sector. The company gets more than one-third of its revenues just from the business it does with community and regional banks as well as deriving substantial revenues from global financial services firms. As interest rates plunge and interest rate spreads deteriorate and as the issues of European banking instability, this time focused on Italy, re-emerge, the outlook for the banking sector has probably dimmed to a degree. This company's business performance is closely correlated with those of its customers, mainly banks. Macro issues are probably going to put guidance increase on the sidelines for now.FIS has several qualities as an investment that I like. It has a business model built on recurring revenues. It has strong and deep relationships with its customers. It knows to locate and execute accretive acquisitions, and indeed, the recent SunGard deal appears to be another example of this capability. For investors looking for a conservative long-term commitment, these shares deserve strong consideration. Even though I anticipate a strong earnings release at the end of this month, I would be cautious regarding the short-term prospects for the shares given the tough environment faced by the company's major customers.FIS: Can growth accelerate and can the company grow its margins?To put the answer first before a whole lot of prose - the company is unlikely to be able to sustain organic growth at rates far above mid-single digits. It just doesn't play in markets that are growing faster than that. Gartner, in commenting about the company's merger with SunGard, put it this way:No one ought to expect that a company whose largest bucket of clients is regional and community banks is going to show rapid growth on its own. But the company is as acquisition machine as the publication Banking Innovation put it when commenting on the SunGard merger. FIS has lots of practice in squeezing costs and exceeding its targets for cost accretion. That is really the heart of the investment case for these shares.This company has had a past mainly composed of acquisitions, and its corporate investor materials more or less suggest that increasing earnings and revenues through acquisitions is the mainstay of FIS's strategy. Top-line growth is not likely to accelerate and Q1 results were probably an outlier in terms of organic growth. But cost accretion is the DNA of this company, and it seems to be able to find pockets of costs that can be readily extinguished without damaging the acquired enterprise.The company took on quite a bit of debt in its acquisition of SunGard as described below. In the short term, its goal is to use cash flow to de-lever its balance sheet by using cash flow to pay down debt. Current debt on the balance sheet aggregates $11.3 billion and cash is just $700 million. Operating cash flow in Q1 was $385 million, up more than 50% from the year-earlier results primarily due to a doubling of depreciation and amortization costs. After paying dividends, and spending about $150 million on capitalized software and other cap ex, the company was able to reduce debt by $150 million for the quarter. The company is not likely to make significant acquisitions until it de-levers its balance sheet.I think the first area to look at in projecting growth potential is related to the recent acquisition of SunGard. As these things go, it was a giant acquisition, adding about $2.8 billion to the FIS revenue base of $6.4 billion. SunGard had been owned by a consortium of private equity firms including Bain and GS Private Equity, Texas Pacific, Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis and two other major P/E firms that bought SunGard for $11.4 billion. It wasn't an outstanding deal to say the least. There were a series of transactions along the way in order to allow the partners to make a modest return, but also in order to pay the mountain of debt that had been taken on to finance the takeover.SunGard had made a number of significant divestitures along the way simply to handle its debt mountain and to attempt to keep peace among seven partners with disparate interests.SunGard's revenues had reached just short of $5 billion at their peak in 2011. By the time of the acquisition, SunGard's revenues had fallen to less than $3 billion as a result of divestitures, particularly of the company's disaster and back-up products and probably as a result of underinvestment and turmoil as the seven private equity co-owners hunted for an exit and bickered about the best way to attain that goal.The largest spinoff was what is now described as Sungardas (SunGard Availability Services), which had a revenue run rate of $1.4 billion in 2014. That company is still operating and is still owned by the seven partners who entered into this investment all the way back in 2005. With the advent of cloud back-up services, physical back-up and disaster recovery solutions have been superseded to a greater or lesser degree as users move more workloads to the cloud and away from their physical premise. Eventually, the partners decided to attempt to liquidate their investment by returning SunGard to the public market through an IPO.Like many FinTech vendors, FIS is both an operating company and an acquisition machine. Most of the time its acquisitions aren't about generating organic growth, they are about generating cost synergies. In some ways, FIS might be considered as an analog of Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) not because it does the same things but because its raison d'etre is that of buying under-performing assets and cleaning up its cost structures (Of course, OTEX hasn't given up on trying to grow organically and it may yet achieve that goal. Certainly, visibility with regards to that aspect of the company's operations will come into sharper focus when it reports in year on results in a few weeks).If investors are looking for a trajectory of substantial increases in organic growth, they are highly unlikely to find it in the assets that were SunGard. They may find a bit of it in revenue accretion opportunities, which certainly exist, and they may find some of it simply because the combined operation is just better run than had been the case when SunGard being run by what might best be described as seven bickering directors with different goals and different timescales. But regardless of the lack of some fantastic revenue growth acceleration, the cost-based accretion is there and the cash flow growth is there.SunGard had been projected to yield $200 million of cost savings as part of the new FIS. Most of those savings have to do with non-revenue-producing functions including corporate/admin, IT and facilities and organization restructuring, which basically means laying off some significant amount of duplicative management. About $30 million out of the $200 million will be in the sales and marketing bucket. At this point, it appears as though the synergies will be higher than projected. At this point, the CEO is talking about exiting 2016 with a $150 million run rate of cost synergies, significantly ahead of schedule. But, as the CEO went on to state, ""we typically beat our targets on synergies."" As the accelerated accretion has not been incorporated into guidance, this leaves room for a Q2 beat and as a buffer for the balance of 2016.On the last conference call, CEO Gary Norcross did actually talk about some revenue synergies. Mr. Norcross felt that most of the revenue synergies are going to come in the second half of this year - the half that just started and probably more into 2017 as sales cycles are reasonably long when selling to financial institutions.The base business of FIS is not the most exciting business opportunity in the IT world. Its customers are retail and commercial banks. Its solutions while mission critical include such things as payments, asset management, risk and compliance and outsourcing. It provides those clients with some core solutions that are necessary, but which aren't expanding greatly either. The company has loads of different banking solutions that help retail banks and other companies in the payments world, but this is not particularly a story about new products driving revenue growth. The company can and does sell smaller banks automated compliance solutions. FIS sells a variety of analytics solutions specifically targeted to the needs of the banking world. Like almost every other IT vendor, it has products that facilitate mobile solutions which really do revolutionize user experiences. Even before the SunGard acquisition, FIS always had products that were used to help financial institutions develop very complex financial products in order to ensure regulatory compliance.Organic growth for the historical assets of FIS is unlikely to accelerate significantly from the rate that it has most recently achieved. The company has had a history of growth through acquisitions. Over the past dozen years, the company has made 16 acquisitions of varying sizes. Prior to the acquisition of SunGard, the company's largest acquisition had been that of Metavante, which had itself made no fewer than 17 acquisitions, of which the most prominent was probably the NYCE Payments Network. Metavante had revenues of about $1.7 billion when it was acquired, so it is still a major source of FIS, which is projecting revenues this year of just shy of $9.5 billion.The company reports its results in two comparably sized buckets. Integrated Financial Solutions is significantly more profitable, a bit larger and a bit faster growing. Global Financial Solutions has been burdened by the acquisition of Capco Consulting, which has shrunk in recent years. Integrated Financial Solutions is the company's bedrock. Its customers are regional and community banks. The company has multi-year contracts, which generate a highly predictable and recurring revenue stream based on processing volume. IFS revenues increased to $3.9 billion last year, up 2%. First-quarter organic growth of 5.4% was a significant achievement and substantially greater than prior expectations.The company does have a relatively small level of revenues coming from both education and public sector verticals. In March, Reuters reported that FIS was seeking to sell those operations. These operations are loss making and seem not to fit easily with the rest of the FIS set of customers. On the call, the CEO really didn't respond unequivocally with regard to the long-term future of those operations within FIS. Public sector specifically was said to have an unusually strong Q1. FIS has a goal of de-levering its balance sheet and the disposition of non-core businesses is a reasonable path to achieve that end. It would not surprise me to see something about some kind of disposition get announced in the near future.Indeed, despite the strength of Q1 performance and the almost sprightly organic growth of 4.2% for the quarter, the company decided it was not prudent to reflect the over-attainment by increasing guidance. While the immediate reaction of the shares to the quarterly earnings release was positive over the last two months, the company's share price performance has been no better than consistent with the performance of the IGV index.Investors in FIS should not buy expecting much in the way of organic revenue growth. There hasn't been much of that in the past, and there are really no signs that organic growth is likely to be a major factor in this company's financial results going forward.Does the company really have a competitive moat that protects its core business?The competitive moats that most investors like to see are those based on superior technology or superior solutions. If that is an investment criterion, FIS is not one of those companies. This is a company whose earnings driver is accretion and not advanced technology. I do not mean to imply that FIS doesn't provide its customers with what they need. But the fact is that trying to provide a community bank with some kind of AI capabilities to help them develop an optimal loan portfolio based on their deposit liabilities is simply neither necessary nor desirable. FIS processes lots and lots of transactions for smaller financial institutions and financial institutions in the investment business. It does that well, it does that without raising hackles, and it results in the company deriving most of its revenue from multi-year contracts that are based on usage.Even for larger customers and for products that aren't just based on usage, the overall pattern is one of recurring revenue. The company actually does close some large deals, but as they are all ratable in nature, they do not show up in the near-term P&L. In the March quarter, FIS had a couple of significant takeaways in its banking sector with both large and mid-size clients, where it is replacing older and less functional solutions. All of these agreements are on multi-year contracts that will be recognized ratably.The company has seen benefits from its SunGard merger in terms of its competitive moat. SunGard was exclusively a software and services company. By acquiring SunGard, the company increased the software component of Global Financial Solutions to 85% of revenue and most of that revenue is coming from longer-term contracts. On the conference call, management spoke about somewhat slower growth and more predictable revenues than was the case before the acquisition of SunGard as more revenue is coming from software sources and is based on longer-term contracts.I don't want to suggest that this company is not in a competitive market space. There are dozens of competitors depending on which specific product line is considered. A few more notable competitors in Transaction Processing include First Data Corp. (NYSE:FDC), Total System (NYSE:TSS) and Western Union (NYSE:WU). There are many, many others, more far too numerous to mention. And of course, the company has to compete with internal development on the part of potential clients as well. Inevitably, for the kinds of solutions that FIS sells, internal development will be the leading alternative. According to CSIMarket, which is apparently the leading research company that compiles these kinds of statistics, FIS has a 13% market share in transaction processing and a 74% market share in lender processing.With regard to the SunGard solutions, Gartner has written that what it calls the banking and securities vertical specific software market ""is highly fragmented with the top 12 vendors claiming less than a 20% market share last year."" It also believes that there are some significant cross-sell opportunities in consulting, treasury, wealth management and risk solutions. Gartner also believes that what FIS calls its Clear2Pay solution, another acquired offering, fits nicely with SunGard's treasury and liquidity products.Competitive moats are most easily defined by technology. Investors believe that technology allows vendors to charge higher prices and achieve higher margins than mere mortals that are obliged to compete head to head with companies offering similar products and clients looking at the cost and rime involved in internal development. There's probably less truth in that premise than many investors realize, but this is not the time or the place to discuss that contention.But competitive moats that are made up of deep client relationships and the ability to sell clients on a greater piece of their overall requirements actually can work quite well and have done so in many instances. Part of Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) success and certainly its success in the applications market is a product of cross selling and deep relationships. My belief is that the heartland of the FIS user base in community and regional banks is actually far more loyal to their vendors than almost any other class of customers - except perhaps insurance companies. If FIS sells them lots of products and if it ensures that what it sells performs as specified, then its competitive moats will be just as impervious and high as any other competitive moat that investors will find in the software business.Brexit - again!I mentioned in several earlier articles that I felt that more than enough had been written concerning Brexit. If electrons could complain about overwork and overuse, they would surely do so at this point with regard to all of the material that has been written in everything from newspapers to scholarly journals regarding Brexit. Many pieces regarding Brexit have been published on this site, representing a very wide variety of views.Brexit is really not an overwhelming risk factor for these shares. What is a far more serious risk factor for a company like FIS are the clouds over the global economic environment in general and over many banks, more outside of this country, in particular. Brexit can be readily fixed by the efforts of even the least insightful of politicians. The issues with the European banking system would take an individual with a super-human intellect to resolve. But as Brexit is such a significant concern, or so it seems based on the quantity of commentary, I will discuss the impact of that on the investment case for FIS as specifically as possible.In discussing Brexit and its potential impact on FIS, it is instructive, I believe, to note that last year 22% of the company's business came from international operations. Including the impact of SunGard for the full year is likely to increase that percentage to 25%. Of that percentage, a significant although unreported percentage of revenues comes from the UK and many clients have paid FIS in GBP in the recent past.Brexit will have the most impact on the business conducted in the UK. Most of the material I have seen forecast a 2-3% contraction in the UK economy due to Brexit. That is not an inconsequential contraction, but 2-3% of say 10% is more or less a rounding error if it happens that way.There are other concerns that Brexit or something else is going to finally lead the Italian banking system into its Armageddon. Actually, that is not all that far-fetched. The Italians never were forced deal with the de facto insolvency of their banking system during the last debt crisis.Italy is a wonderful country to visit - the food, the delightful people, the scenery, the wine, the art... even most of the time the weather. But for a variety of reasons, the Italian economy is not nearly productive enough to support the country's debt loads, and with bad loans at 30% of assets in some or even many Italian banks according to some published reports, some and perhaps most Italian banks are really insolvent without a significant government bailout. Since the Italian government has no borrowing capacity, that would necessarily lead to EU - read German - intervention.What does all of that have to do with FIS, particularly? In my view, not very much. The collapse of the Italian banking system may be the straw that causes the structure of the EU to seriously implode. But that denouement, should it come to pass, is not going to have a unique impact on FIS. If readers and investors believe in that scenario, then they have no business investing in FIS or anything other than gold and treasuries.FIS sells a wide variety of products to smaller banks and to all sizes of financial services companies. It sells some products to the retail vertical as well. 75% of its business is in North America. There's a not-insignificant correlation between transactions at banks, and the revenues for FIS (There's also a secular trend that's leading to lower volumes of check processing as more and more transactions at the regional and community banks that are the preponderance of the FIS customer base are done online and do not generate any physical records). Bank transaction volume, other than the aforementioned secular decline in check processing, has a strong correlation with economic activity. If readers believe that Brexit or some other factor is going to lead to a recession, then with a high degree of certainty this writer believes that a recession will have an impact on this company's business because transaction volumes will decline and the ability of FIS to obtain new clients, small as it is now, will be further inhibited.Brexit is an investment risk to be considered with regard to FIS under some projected scenarios. FIS sells products to banks, and banks will likely suffer disproportionately in a world where Brexit impacts are not ameliorated by central bank policy initiatives. But there are plenty of other dire macro possibilities that will impact economic activity in general and the customers of FIS in particular. The shares of this company do not explicitly rise or fall on interest rate spreads, but the health of its customers will determine its transaction revenues and its ability to attract whatever few new clients that are ever available.ValuationSo, how to value FIS. It is not a growth story for sure, and it will never be one in the foreseeable future. A company, even in FinTech, that spends 2-3% of its revenue on R&D as is the case for FIS, will never be able to roll out enough new products and new solutions to achieve a significant upside to organic growth. FIS does generate high levels of cash because its depreciation is high. It pays a very parsimonious dividend these days, which provides a 1.4% yield. The dividend is not likely to increase until the company makes some notable progress in paying off the mountain of debt that it acquired along with SunGard. The company currently pays out less than 25% of its free cash flow. So, the shares are not going to be for dividend investors at this point.I will reprise some valuation statistics just for the convenience of readers. The company has an enterprise value of $35 billion at this writing. Revenue expectations for the next 12 months are approximately $9.7 billion, which put the EV/S at 3.6X. The P/E based on the consensus estimates of 21 analysts is 18X. Not super cheap perhaps, but this is a company with a reasonable stability and visibility in its earnings outlook. And some of the valuation certainly relates not to the company's organic growth, but to its ability to serve as an industry consolidator and to find accretive deals, which will lead to far greater EPS growth than can be projected just looking at its current assets. EPS is estimated to grow at 18% this year and 15% next year, which is far greater than organic revenue growth. Should the company find additional acquisitions to make, EPS will be higher.The company, as mentioned earlier, was able to increase operating cash flow by 67% year on year last quarter, primarily because depreciation almost doubled and because deferred revenues showed a large increase. These changes were brought about in part by the merger, although the year earlier numbers have been adjusted to include the results of SunGard.Like many companies, this one doesn't forecast cash flow with any level of specificity. On its last conference call, CFO Woody Woodall said that free cash flow for the year will approximate actual reported earnings. That would be free cash flow of $1.24 billion. That seems likely to be a conservative forecast given the Q1 results which saw free cash flow of just shy of $340 million.Operating cash flow is not likely to rise by 67% in each of the next three quarters. It doesn't seem all that likely that it will fall either as would have to be the case in order for the company estimate to be accurate. Last year, cash flow in the first three quarters of the year was roughly comparable, and then cash flow was much stronger in Q4 primarily reflecting very significant changes in the balance sheet. Should the company estimate $1.24 billion for free cash flow prove to be accurate, that would represent a reasonable, although not spectacular, free cash flow yield of 3.6%.The Shortest-Term OutlookFIS is going to report Q2 earnings on July 26. I doubt that the operating results for the quarter were influenced in any noticeable fashion by Brexit or even by the realignment in exchange rates at the end of the quarter simply because the level of foreign assets held by this company is small. The CFO did not adjust the Q2 outlook for FIS despite the Q1 over-attainment. Management increased its estimate of year one accretion from the SunGard merger, but didn't increase overall earnings estimates. Some of the revenue trends that helped Q1 doubtless persisted in Q2, and some of the larger negative trends such as the contraction in Commercial Services business where a non-strategic contract renewal that has depressed revenue comparisons will have finally have ""anniversaried"" and will no longer be a factor in reported numbers.The current consensus outlook for Q2 calls for EPS of $.87, up from $.79 in Q1, and for revenues of $2.32 billion, up from $2.2 billion. My guess, for what it is worth, is that there is a bit of upside to both of these estimates, particularly given the logic behind the assumptions that make up the estimates.In my view, the key concern is going to be 2H guidance. Brexit itself is unlikely to be a principal concern. On the other hand, the impact to bank profitability of the current interest rate structure can't be ignored. And while the correlation is not going to be 1 for 1, the economic pressures on this company's customers in both banking and in financial services is likely to be noticeable. I think that regardless of the likely potential of a Q2 beat, the best that can be expected for 2H guidance is that it will be flat. I'm concerned that companies that sell to banks and sell in the financial services markets regardless of anything else may be under some pressure the next few months until the issues involved with incomparably low rates can be resolved.Summing Up:"
3434656,25120,2015-08-13T19:31:20-04:00,"FIS announces that it will acquire privately-held SunGard in a $9.1 billion deal.The purchase makes both financial and strategic sense.Investors approve the deal and send shares of FIS a lot higher, thereby pricing in the benefits of the transaction.Given the full valuation and leverage prohibiting large deal-making in the near term, I remain cautious at current times.","Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) is a large but relatively unknown provider of banking, payment and outsourcing solutions. The company announced a major deal that it will purchase SunGard in order to expand its presence and capabilities across the globe.The deal multiples are fair, as investors stand to benefit from cheap debt financing, cost synergies and a strong track record with regards to past deal-making. Unfortunately, investors in FIS have already priced in a lot of the benefits resulting from the deal, leaving little imminent appeal at current levels.The TransactionFIS is happy to pay $9.1 billion to acquire privately-held SunGard which provides services for the financial industry. This is a considerable sum, as FIS is financing the purchase for roughly 45% in terms of cash as well as 55% in terms of its own stock.For this large sum of money, the company will acquire a business with $2.8 billion in sales which are generated by 13,000 workers. Based on the deal multiple, FIS is acquiring SunGard at a 3.2 times sales multiple. What is remarkable is that Fidelity did not report an EBITDA contribution for SunGard. Based on the pro-forma adjusted EBITDA profitability of $2.8 billion, it follows that SunGard's EBITDA comes in around $800 million. This suggests that FIS is paying an 11-12 times multiple for the company.The sales and EBITDA multiple paid for SunGard looks relatively attractive given the multiples at which the company itself is trading. Fidelity is commencing a $23 billion enterprise valuation ahead of the deal. This is equivalent to 3.6 times trailing sales and 13 times EBITDA. Based on both metrics, FIS trades at a 10-15% premium versus its acquisition target.The Strategic RationaleThe decision to acquire SunGard is based on the financial and strategic rationale. With the purchase, FIS can offer a great and complementary range of products and services to a larger group of customers. The combination will see a greater presence in asset management and capital markets in particular. After a few difficult years, SunGard has picked up real momentum in these areas.Another benefit is the increased geographical diversification for the business. The new company will derive 26% of sales from overseas markets which compares to 22% ahead of the deal. This increase is driven by SunGard's relatively larger operations in Europe and Asia.The financial rationale from the deal seems obvious as well. For starters, it is the fact that FIS will be acquiring the business at a lower multiple compared to its own valuation. Cheap financing and the goal to unlock synergies should become key value drivers going forward. Cost savings are seen at $100 million in 2016 and are expected to double the year after.These $200 million in cost savings are worth quite a lot as FIS trades at 12-13 times EBITDA. Fidelity furthermore stresses that the actual synergies from past deal-making came in around 130% of the initial targets.The Pro-Forma Business And Leverage ConcernsFIS reports that the pro-forma business will generate revenues of $9.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion. The company already operated with $4.5 billion in net debt ahead of the deal. The 45% cash component for the deal suggests that leverage will increase by another $4.1 billion to $8.6 billion.Surprisingly enough, FIS reports a pro-forma $11.5 billion debt load in the deal presentation, which does not seem to match up with the other facts being reported. This came after a gross debt of $5.0 billion at the end of the second quarter, on top of which comes the 45% cash component from the deal.The company reports that an $11.5 billion debt load is equivalent to 3.7 times adjusted EBITDA. Based on my calculations, the leverage term will come in closer to 3 times. Both metrics are fairly high, yet it should be stressed that roughly 80% of the company's revenues are recurring in nature, supporting higher leverage ratios.With 325 million outstanding shares following the deal, equity is now valued at roughly $23 billion, as shares have risen to nearly $70 per share in response to the deal, supporting a total enterprise valuation of $32 billion. Based on these metrics, the pro-forma business is valued at 3.5 times sales and 11-12 times adjusted EBITDA after taking into account the anticipated synergies.FIS posted net earnings of roughly $700 million on a stand-alone basis, equivalent to roughly $2.50 per share. Given that EBITDA margins of both businesses are similar, I assume that SunGard is able to post operating margins of 18% as well.This means that the $9 billion deal could add roughly $500 million in operating earnings while the interest portion on the cash component of the deal comes in at roughly $150 million. This suggests that after-tax profits could increase by $200-$250 million following the deal. With the share base increasing to 325 million shares following the deal, earnings are seen at roughly $2.75 to $3.00 per share. After taking into account the full realization of synergies, earnings could jump by another $0.40 per share some two years down the road.These calculations are consistent with the company's announcement that adjusted earnings could increase by 20% after taking into account the full realization of cost synergies.Final RemarksInvestors in general like information providers such as Fidelity National Information Services. Their strong intellectual property, small range of large competitors and recurring revenue streams make them predictable.With investors favoring predictability over surprises, they are willing to attach higher valuation multiples to more predictable businesses. This is even the case as growth is not that inspiring. Another benefit is that stability allows balance sheets to become more leveraged, as creditors feel more comfortable with such business models as well.After taking into account synergies, FIS is paying a 9 times EBITDA multiple, which seems attractive given that its own shares trade at 12 times EBITDA. The $200 million in synergies could be worth $2 billion if these benefits are awarded a 10 times multiple.In response to the fair multiples paid, the targeted synergies, and the solid track record with regards to previous deals, investors have pushed up the valuation of FIS by roughly $1.5 billion. This means that most of the benefits are priced in already, resulting in little opportunities for investors who contemplate to take a position at current levels.Shares now exchange hands at roughly 20-22 times after taking into account the synergy estimates by 2017. These are still elevated multiples in my opinion, certainly as leverage is very high.Given the full valuation based on earnings a few years down the road, and the fairly elevated leverage ratios, I see few triggers which could potentially push shares higher in the short- to medium-term. These factors weigh more heavily compared to the strong track record and predictability of the business model, making me very cautious as investors have priced in the good news already."

From a simple bill-payment process and card-based transaction to direct account transfers, the complexity of financial services and digital payment has been opportune to financial technology firms. The digital shift has seen an exponential growth over the last few years, with companies coming out with innovative and strategic ways to dominate the financial services space.Payment systems around the globe help ensure inherent technology to support monetary transactions from an individual or entity to another. With disruptive technologies in the financial technology (Fintech) sector, start-ups are targeting customer convenience, security, adherence to regulatory compliance and technical infrastructure.

(NASDAQ: FISV) and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE: FIS) have held dominance in the fintech sector, with strong fundamentals and key acquisitions in the past years. With American Banker ranking Fiserv third by revenue for 2015 in its domain and FIS bagging number one spot in IDC Fintech, such achievements signal volumes about how the companies have come a long way in terms of innovation and value creation for their stakeholders. For financial institutions outsourcing payment services to fintech firms, the cost of maintaining physical and virtual infrastructure and risk indulgence is significantly brought down.Source: Filings from the SECFiserv primarily operates by dealing in electronic payment processing, mobile and internet banking, account processing, services in source capturing and cash management with financial institutes and other companies carrying out similar transactions. With two major acquisitions lined up for completion this year, the company has served expansionary motives by acquiring Dovetail Group Limited and enhancing its payment infrastructure, and Monitise plc [LSE: MONI] for $98 million by diversifying into the digital suite domain. With Zelle enabling people to directly transfer money relying on a user’s email address and mobile number, Fiserv has supported the platform - a frictionless path for P2P solutions. Major revenue driver for Fiserv has been its payment segment, by offering 24-hour access to its digital platforms to financial institutions like banks and companies alike, with a recorded revenue growth of 6% as on March 2017 from December 2016 last year.Source: Filings from the SECFurther intensifying the fintech sector, Fidelity National Information Services offers solutions both in enterprise banking and retail domain, covering a plethora of services in payments, capital markets, insurance, risk and regulatory compliance and financial consulting. FIS has been serving its clients in close to 130 geographies, thus providing holistic consulting and outsourcing solutions. As a Fortune 500 company, the firm has come a long way to be a member of the S&P 500 Index. The corporate and global financial solution (GFS) segment for the firm boosted revenue by 37% and 3% as on March 2017 compared with December 2016 numbers.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECFiserv has recorded a 26% margin figure in its cash from operating activities, thus showcasing the efficiency the firm has witnessed over the last 3 years in terms of controlling variable costs and driving operations to garner profits. In line with above numbers, EBITDA margin is promising at 30%, though the indicator is not a comprehensive measure as it involves superfluous costs. Comparable numbers are showcased by EBIT margin positioned at 26% in Q2 this year. ROE stands at 38% for 2016 with the 3-year average at 30%, portraying strengthening claims of profitability. The firm substantiates profitability figures which accounted for an ROIC of 13%. Higher returns for Fiserv are as a result of increase in financial leverage, which is depicted by a rising debt to equity ratio from 1.073x three years back to the current ratio of 1.983x. Though leverage has witnessed a hike in the last couple of years, the company has been paying back its debt on time by keeping robust levels of EBITDA in comparison with its long-term liabilities.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECExploring Fiserv’s turnover ratios, the company has only managed to produce close to $0.58 of sales for every $1 invested as an asset. This figure has more likely hovered in the range of $0.56-0.58, claiming stability the last 2 years. Certain reasons may be responsible for it including major acquisitions this year and adherence to regulatory government compliance, thus transforming asset into sales. The figures can be an indication for investors to rely on fundamentals of the firm in the long run, in terms of the underlying profitability that FISV offers. Also, since corporate segment for the firm has dwindled over the last couple of years, a major chunk of investments must have been diverted there. The firm followed a major repurchase program in the quarter with 2.5 million shares for $295 million, returning $684 million back to the shareholders through June 2017.On the contrary, FIS did not exhibit promising numbers with total asset turnover standing at 0.37x from 0.25x. The numbers have improved, yet conversion investment in assets to 0.37 in sales does not compare to industry average as a whole. EBIT margins as an indicator of company’s earnings ability saw a significant decline from 17% in 2015 to 15% in Q2 2017. Pressure on both firms in terms of tax burden is 68% and 62%, respectively, with a major chunk of sales diverted as taxes. Though major segments have been performing well, tax norms in the sector need easing so that net income attributable to shareholders in the longer run can improve. The cash flow from operating activities relates to 19% from operations which is less than the one recorded by Fiserv. The ROIC at 5% might seem a bit constrained because of the recent acquisition of SunGard, owing to which the combined firm annual revenue may stand at $9 million, with 2017 likely to showcase improved earnings. Similar trend is exemplified by ROE of 8% which is near the industry average of 7.2%.For both Fiserv and FIS, the free cash flow to the firm comes at an average of 16% over three years, sustaining the repurchase program implemented by the management of both companies. Moreover, historical trends in dividend payment from FIS may be expanded over the next quarters, increasing the dividend yield due to healthy levels of free cash flow. Gross margins for FIS have increased owing to improved margins from processing item solutions and by charging an increased termination fee. In accordance, with integrative service and cost management initiatives by FIS, improved operating margins thus sustain revamped signals for investors.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECThe market ratios provide some key insights to an investor and help make investment decisions. Both the firms, though incurring profits and revenue growth, still fall short of fundamentals. A look at the valuation ratios for the two firms provides a stronger picture in order to make a call on whether to buy the stocks or not. For FISV, revenue growth may not seem that evident, but for value stocks a company might appear optimistic based on higher margins, free cash flows, a promising and good enough P/E ratio and similar factors. Similarly, FIS with its disciplined capital structure, improved profit margins and dividend payments combined with a P/E multiple of 27.67x looks like an encouraging investment. Firms in the financial services sector undergo high tax rate compliance, incurring huge tax expenses, and could benefit from a tax reform in the future. Both Fiserv and FIS have a low EV/EBITDA at 16.95x and 14.52x, respectively, delivering an undervalued stock compared to the industry.FISV data by YChartsThe companies have outperformed the market in the last couple of years, but a rare slump should not deter investors from taking positions. One of possible triggers for the stock can be Zelle as a diversifying segment, which will support FISV for transferring money through the P2P platforms within a fraction of seconds. This will not only ensure segment expansion but also prowess FISV in the domain, competing with apps from PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) which have garnered considerable market share since inception. Investors, as a result, can expect strong boost in volumes and future revenue growth. For FIS, double-digit average growth has been observed for the past few years, a major splurge in earnings due to some recent acquisitions and synergies. The company is up for a roll and revenue growth is likely to be in the range of 3-5%. Generous dividend yields provided by the firm speak about the firm's underlying value in comparison with rival companies. As a leader ranked number one in a host of recent surveys, FIS has been emerging as one of the best investments in the financial technology space."

However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the sole factor in investment decisions as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It's through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.FIS data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFIS Dividend data by YChartsConclusionFidelity National Information Services does not qualify for either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio along with the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor takes issue with the level of debt relative to the current assets. As a result, any purchase of the company is made with a speculative nature behind it. That said, any speculator interested in pursuing the company should still proceed to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.With regard to the intrinsic value, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $1.24 in 2011 to an estimated $2.36 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth supports the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 9.49% annually over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model therefore returns an estimate of intrinsic value within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating the company is fairly valued at the present time."
2300205,52262,2014-07-07T14:00:00-04:00,Changing regulatory requirements for banks will make Fidelity National Information Services products more in demand just as rate increases boost bank's income.The firm offers a suite of services that are also becoming more important for modern international banks.Together the recovery in the US and long-term growth internationally should support substantial long-term growth in Fidelity National Information Services' earnings and share price.,"Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) is a backend provider of processing services to other financial institutions. The company has underperformed operationally over the last year or so as the broader financial industry has struggled against a backdrop of low interest rates, low equity volatility, and an anemic fixed income trading environment. This difficult external environment has only been partially offset by FIS' high degree of recurring revenue in the transaction processing business. These issues appear to be starting to abate and for investors looking to take a position in a nuts-and-bolts financial infrastructure firm, Fidelity National Information Services is a good choice at this point.FIS management has sounded increasingly positive on the overall operating environment over the last couple of conference calls, and the firm's strategy of focusing on larger financial institutions (or FIs) seems to be paying dividends. I expect to see FIS' revenue growth accelerate as we enter 2H2014, and by year end, mid-single digit revenue growth is likely. Fidelity National Information Services is seeing some issues in certain geographies (like Brazil which has been positively anemic recently), but if the global economy picks up these (as it appears to be), this should be less of an issue in the second half as well. What's more, FIS is likely to start repurchasing shares in earnest going forward with a $2B authorization remaining (only $175M in repurchase completed in 1Q2014).All told then I think FIS is worth a look given the firm's strong pipeline, likely growth acceleration over the next six months (company outlook is for 4.5-6.5% organic revenue growth and EBITDA growth). The broader international market for the firm appears particularly promising with the firm now having seen three straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth here (10% in the most recent quarter). While international markets are seeing a bit of margin pressure, I think this will abate over time. Overall, as international financial markets continue to grow and become more sophisticated, I expect Fidelity National Information Services to be a major long-term winner. I am always hesitant to use the term secular growth story as I think it gets thrown around a lot, but in this case Fidelity National and its ties to long term growth in international financial markets may well make it appropriate.Fidelity National Information Services probably benefits from its obvious historical association with the much larger Fidelity National Financial. FIS was formed in 2006 in a combination of Fidelity's (the big company) information processing subsidiary and Certegy, a provider of check and card processing services. The resulting company provided a battery of backend technology based processing and information services to financial companies in two main segments, transaction processing services and lending processing services. The lender processing services division was spun-out to FIS shareholders during the recession in 2008 (which carved out FIS' mortgage risk at an obviously sensitive time for that business), and in 2009 the remaining FIS (focused on transaction processing) acquired Metavante Technologies for $4B and change. After a reorganization around this merger, the new FIS does processing of deposits and loans, provides customer facing technology for ATMs and bank websites, credit card production and activation, and fraud management.This group of services may sound dull, but the reality is that without them, it is very hard to run a modern bank. Customers in the US and increasingly internationally, expect to be able to use ATMs, online banking, and credit and debit cards. Yet most banks lack the expertise to run this diverse portfolio of products themselves, and that is where FIS can help. While major banks can do many of these things on their own (and indeed some do which makes internal technology departments a serious competitor for FIS in some cases), most mid-sized financial institutions lack the budget or expertise to realistically offer a comprehensive suite of services. Given this, the transaction processing business has seen considerable consolidation in recent years with major competitors to the modern FIS reducing the once cut-throat competition in the space. Peers like First Data Corp and Electronic Data Systems are now FIS' biggest competitors in the regional banking markets.FIS has a major presence in Latin America, especially Brazil, where is a major card services provider. A couple of acquisitions (Belgian firm Capco in 2010 and eFunds in 2008) have aided the firm in developing its international presence, and I think that future bolt-on international acquisitions are likely. While FIS has made some acquisitions in recent years and has put in a good deal of effort on the cost-cutting and efficiency front, management commentary suggests that the firm is certainly open to future deals as well.In addition to the opportunities internationally, the Dodd-Frank act and other post-recession regulatory changes have made the banking business much more complex which in turn is creating opportunities for Fidelity National Information Services. A lot of financial institutions are having to turn to outside help to deal with the modern complexities of fraud management and other required services. Many of these functions were once performed in-house, but that seems to be changing as the new regulatory regime looks to be a permanent feature of the industry.The trend towards outsourcing some of these functions to experts will probably only increase as banks begin to loosen their purse strings once interest rates start to rise. With the economy clearly well on its way towards full health again (skeptics merely need look at the recent jobs numbers for evidence there), at some point in the next year or so the Fed will start to raise rates. Once that happens, banks will begin earning a lot more money on loans they make which should make them more willing to shell out for FIS' software and services. That in turn should lead to substantial double-digit EPS growth in 2015, which will catapult the stock higher. Patient investors should look at the stock today in preparation for the increasingly positive environment that FIS will see over the next couple of years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1660262,54022,2013-08-27T15:20:47-04:00,,"[Editor's Note, August 28: This article has been revised since original publication, as the author has made changes to the content]As a sky-high bull market begins to stomach the butterflies of a market correction, picking the right stock to go long can be a tricky trade. With a looming dial down in open market treasury purchases, those equities bloated with the Fed's liquidity are soon to be exposed and repriced at their intrinsic values. Despite the fact that tech and software tend to stand on the vanguard of market movements, I've found a company that has sustained impressive growth and positioned itself exceptionally well for the forward five-year horizon. In fact, its intrinsic valuation leads me to believe it is significantly undervalued.The company that I am long is, quite quietly, the largest financial technology company: Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS). FIS provides financial institutions -- mostly regional and community banks -- with back-end solutions to facilitate account processing and payment clearance as well as front-end online and mobile banking platforms for end users. FIS topped the 2012 annual FinTech 100 list, and is a Fortune 500 member and component of the S&P Index. Today, FIS trades at $45.70 whereas my valuation prices the company at $56.92, implying the stock is 24.5% undervalued. Although we sit at the edge of broader correction, I estimate FIS's year-end price target to climb up to its fair value.Business Overview -- The FactsFIS services approximately 14,000 clients including banks, credit unions, thrifts, and leasing and finance companies. In 2012, FIS reported ~$1 billion of operating income on $5.8 billion in revenue. In addition, the company's top 50 clients contribute slightly less than 25% of total revenue. The company's revenue can be divided into three streams: 1) financial solutions group, 2) payment solution group, and 3) international solutions group services. The following qualitative breakdown of FIS's three segment offerings includes descriptions from FIS's website and 2012 10-K filing:Financial Solutions Group: FIS's financial solutions group services the core and related ancillary processing needs of North American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders, and independent community and savings institutions. FIS offers a selection of in-house and outsourced solutions to banking customers that span the range of asset sizes. FSG customers are typically committed under multi-year contracts, providing a recurring revenue base and opportunities for cross selling. Specific offerings include:1) Core Processing -- This consists of software applications that are designed to run banking processes for financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems. FIS also offers a number of ancillary applications in addition to the primary application listed above, including branch automation, back office support systems, and compliance support.2) Electronic Banking -- This consists of a suite of retail delivery applications that enable financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes. Consumer Electronic Banking and Business Internet Banking both provide an extensive set of cash management capabilities, enabling customers to manage banking and payments through the Internet, mobile devices, accounting software, and telephone.Payment Solutions Group: PSG provides a set of software and services for the EFT, card processing, item processing, bill payment, and government payments processing needs of customers in North America. PSG is focused on servicing the payment and electronic funds transfer needs of North American headquartered banks and credit unions, commercial lenders, independent community and savings institutions and government institutions. PSG customers typically commit to multi-year contracts that provide recurring revenues based on underlying payment transaction volumes. Specific offerings include:1) Item Processing and Output Services -- This segment provides financial institutions with the equipment needed to capture data from checks, transaction tickets and other items; image and sort items; process exceptions through keying; and perform balancing, archiving and the production of statements. These processing services are utilized by more than 1,500 financial institutions and are performed at one of eight item processing centers located throughout the U.S. or on-site at customer locations. Solutions also include data capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management. Additional output services that are ancillary to the primary solutions it provides, including print and mail capabilities and card personalization fulfillment services.2) Credit Card -- This solution segment allows customers to issue credit and debit cards and provides card production and activation.3) Electronic Funds Transfer -- FIS's electronic funds transfer and debit card processing businesses offer settlement and card management solutions for financial institution card issuers. The company provides traditional ATM- and PIN-based debit network access and emerging real-time payment alternatives to customers.International Solutions Group: ISG provides local services to customers in more than 100 countries around the world. The services delivered by FIS in these locations provide many of the same financial and payments solutions offered in North America. (i.e., core banking applications, channel solutions, card and merchant services, item processing and check risk management solutions to financial institutions, card issuers and retailers.For a more detailed revenue breakdown, see below:Click to enlarge images.Investment Thesis 1: Significant Revenue VisibilityA majority of FIS's revenue -- in all three product segments -- stem from customer contracts that average four to six years in length. These contracts generate significant revenue visibility, as I estimate a strong majority of revenue is processing and maintenance based and therefore recurring in nature. In addition, these sticky customer contracts usually stipulate terms that are favorable for FIS, requiring customers to pay termination fees that make up close to the balance of the outstanding contract life if they choose to cancel. Once these contracts expire, customer renewal rates are high due to the mission-critical nature of the software. In other words, banks rely on FIS's core processing in order to operate and interact with customers.Therefore, when the contract expires, banks usually lack the flexibility to price shop and the desire to enter into a new sales cycle. In addition, no bank wants the repeated headache of undergoing an entire new implementation phase, which often takes nine to 12 months and costs millions of dollars. Thus, banks are much more prone to renew their contracts and usually cultivate a close relationship with their vendor.Investment Thesis 2: Healthy Customer Base and Low Customer ConcentrationIt might be a surprise to consider that FIS actually enjoys a healthy and stable customer base. Although the pace of industry consolidation that has taken place over the last 15 years can't be ignored (i.e., the number of federally insured banks decreased from 17,901 in 1984 to 7,357 in 2011 as the number of banks with assets with less than $25 million declined by 96%) FIS's target segment of banks with AUM of $1 billion< has actually grown in the past decade. According to the FDIC 2012 report, the number of financial institutions with more than $1 billion AUM has grown by 14% over the past decade, from 584 to 666 institutions worldwide.In addition, despite there being less institutions, there is no doubt that underlying banking activity has not decreased over this time. The number of accounts, volume of deposits, and number of loans has increased significantly both in the long run and in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. Consolidation can actually work to the advantage of FIS in terms of gaining market share if an acquiring bank -- one which is a FIS customer -- requires that its target's systems align. And lastly, FIS's customer base is well diversified, as its top customer only accounts for 5% of total revenue.Investment Thesis 3: Push to MobileIn March 2013, FIS completed the acquisition of mFoundry, a leading provider of mobile banking and payment solutions. It is within mobile that I believe FIS will grow the most. While nearly 90% of financial institutions now offer a mobile banking platform, it is estimated that only 53 million people have adopted this channel as of 2013, which is expected to increase to 100 million adults by 2015. Accordingly, FIS generates a per transaction fee from banks that process transactions through FIS's mobile platform. Among regional and community banks especially, mobile adoption is poised for accelerated growth over the next two years as penetration rates increase. The chart below depicts the historical trajectory of U.S. active mobile banking users.Investment Thesis 4: International GrowthFIS, relative to competitors, has succeeded enormously in its push to expand overseas. Currently, FIS's international solutions group accounts for 21% of revenue, demonstrating a higher degree of international penetration than any of its competitors. With the shake-up of the US banking industry, the fact that FIS is well positioned in global markets and has geographically diversified its customer base will keep the company ahead of its peers. More specifically, it will allow FIS to align with the global secular shift to electronic payment.The company has provided bankcard issuing services to global markets for ~15 years and, accordingly, has developed the infrastructure and relationships to continue to penetrate critical international markets. In particular, FIS has garnered increasing interest for its outsourced solutions from European institutions seeking to achieve greater operational efficiencies. This, in turn, has strengthened FIS's pipeline. Moreover, in 2012 FIS became the largest third-party card processor in Brazil and Asia Pacific, and has steadily built up its ATM presence in India.Investment Thesis 5: FIS Has Consistently Rewarded ShareholdersAccording to FIS's 2012 10-K, in February 2012, FIS's board increased the quarterly per share dividend by 300% to $0.20 per share and also increased the company's share repurchasing authority to $1B. In total, the company returned $686 million to shareholders in 2012 through share repurchases and dividends. Subsequently, in February 2013, FIS's board increased the quarterly dividend yet again by 10% to $.22 per share. This disciplined capital allocation has translated into a total return, including dividends, of 34% in 2012 compared to a total 16% return for the S&P 500, and paves the way for further capital appreciation in the near future.Model Walk-ThroughGiven this context, my DCF integrates this growth trajectory neither aggressively nor conservatively by applying the same five-year CAGR from 2008-12 to build out top line growth for the forward five-year horizon. Specifically, in this base case I input the 14.6% CAGR, 9.3% CAGR, and 9% CAGR of FIS's financial institution segment, payments segment, and international segment, respectively. (The weighted average CAGR across all segments is ~9%, which I again do not believe is aggressive given the fact that it's based on a CAGR pitted directly in the crisis when bank IT spend declined significantly.) I then apply the mean operating margin from 2008-12 for each segment to build out EBITDA. Based on historical provision for income taxes, I calculate FIS's effective tax rate at 19.2%. Moving downwards to free cash flow, I project D&A, capex, and working capital changes using a trailing five-year mean of their percentages of revenue, respectively.Finally, after discounting these free cash flows by FIS's WACC of 6.7% and adding a sensitized EV/EBITDA multiple-based terminal value, FIS's implied share price trades at ~$56.92, roughly 24.5% higher than its current market price at $45.70.One last note -- for informational purposes, I have also calculated the present value of FIS's dividends, which I did by taking the average quarterly historical declared dividend, annualizing it, and then discounting by cost of equity. This comes out to $4.15 a share, which represents 7.3% of the implied per share fair value. Especially in the context of the financial technology industry, I view this relatively higher ratio as an added bonus to shareholders in light of management's capital allocation strategy. Competitive LandscapeFIS's top two competitors are Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) and Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY), both publicly traded, which serve 16,000 and 11,000 banks, respectively. Industry consolidation, however, plays out most favorably for FIS since FIS has the highest penetration rate amongst large regional banks with more than $1 billion in AUM. As such, as larger banks continue to gobble up smaller community players and strive for integrated systems, naturally FIS will experience an uptake in market share. Accordingly, FIS generates nearly 45% more revenue for each customer.As it stands, core systems' market share is broken down according to the graph below.Comparable multiples and operating metrics, in addition, are highlighted below.Source: Yahoo Finance.Although FIS trades at a slightly higher P/E than its peers, I am confident it is still vastly underpriced. The difference in FIS's top-line growth over the last five years from JKHY and FISERV has positioned FIS on a trajectory that more than makes up the difference for the slight P/E premium. This is why I place more weight on PEG, for which FIS actually trades at a discount to its peers.In fact, based on earnings growth projected in my model, FIS's forward P/E declines dramatically if shares continue to trade at today's $45.70 value. Eventually, the stock becomes too cheap even relative to peers and the market will need to reprice it accordingly. Below you can track the P/E curve over the next five years.Risks and MitigantsFor further deliberation, below I have included what I feel are the two primary risks regarding investing in FIS, along with their respective mitigants.ConclusionTherefore, I issue a strong buy rating for FIS. Having calculated an implied fair value of $56.92, I reckon the market has underpriced this company by 24.5%. In spite of the fact that FIS trades at a slightly higher P/E than FISERV and Jack Henry, I still believe it is underpriced to this extent. If we were just to assume that growth continues, for the next five years, at the same CAGR as during the crisis and post-crisis recovery, then top-line growth will more than make up for this slight P/E premium. This is why I emphasize the importance of PEG, for which FIS is priced more cheaply.Over the past five years, its financial services and payments solution growth rates have crushed those of Fiserv and Jack Henry, and the company commands a much larger global presence. This, along with the company's diverse customer base, significant revenue visibility as a result of sticky contracts, and a strong push in mobile software solutions only serve to boost the company's operating prospects. Lastly, FIS has continued to reward shareholders. It has increased its quarterly dividend several times over the past few years and has embarked on a hefty share repurchasing program. In conclusion, the rocky road on which Ben Bernanke has taken us only demonstrates that it is ever more important to look a bit closer to find value. FIS may just be the quietest Fortune 500 gem.Disclosure: I am long FIS. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

While some growth concerns have stalled out the stock a few times in the last three years, the shares have risen more than 20% year to date, outperforming peers like Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) and Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and more or less keeping pace with First Data (FDC). While FIS certainly isn't as cheap as it was, the shares still hold some appeal as the company looks toward improving underlying conditions. Not only is management executing very well with its integration of Sungard, it's leveraged to expanding interest margins among its bank customers, aging IT infrastructure, and growth overseas. With the potential to drive FCF growth in the high single digits to low double-digits, FIS's share price could approach $100. FIS is among the leading providers of outsourced IT solutions to the banking industry, offering a range of products for transaction and account processing, payment processing/solutions, risk management, compliance, and so forth. Fiserv is larger overall in market share terms (more than twice the size if credit unions are included), but FIS is a leader at the larger end of the market ($1 billion or more in assets), where it leads Fiserv with over one-third share. FIS's basic model is attractive. Close to 90% of revenue in its IFS segment (which addresses primarily domestic banks) is recurring, with contracts averaging around five years, and a meaningful portion of the revenue is tied to account and transaction volume. Banks tend to be sticky customers (as they can ill-afford significant operational disruption), and among those banks that outsource their IT needs, it is estimated that only a low single-digit percentage change vendors in any given year. There are several attractive underlying drivers for FIS today. First, FIS facilitates a lot of things that banks want to do. Many banks are trying to grow their card businesses, and about 20% of FIS's revenue comes through facilitating card businesses (including activating cards). FIS also helps banks go digital and mobile; while mobile and online banking isn't a revenue-generator per se for banks, it is an increasingly important competitive element and it does help facilitate cost cuts elsewhere within banks. Last and not least is the potential for analytics to drive more demand for FIS and more growth for bank customers – banking transactions create a wealth of data and the right analytical tools can help banks tailor and market revenue-generating services for their customers (services that, based on the customer's demonstrated behavior, would be of use). Another driver concerns the state of spending and spending priorities at banks. In the recent low-rate/low-spread environment, many banks were fixated on cutting costs. As net interest margins expand again, though, there will likely be more interest among bank customers in IT reinvestments designed to spur or support growth. Many banks have also found themselves under greater regulatory scrutiny and the increasing regulatory burden (and the rate of change in regulations) is leading them to look at outsourcing as a more effective way of keeping up.Last and least is an opportunity to benefit from increased adoption of outsourcing. Where Fiserv has traditionally been more interested in mid-sized banks (and Jack Henry more with small-to-mid-sized banks), FIS has focused on larger players. While these customers can offer substantial revenue potential, they can be tough nuts to crack – these banks have much larger budgets and can handle more of their IT needs in-house. To that end, FIS management has previously reported that out of the 135 largest banks, only 28 outsource their core platform (FIS serves 26 of them, with Fiserv serving the other two). This could change over time, though. First, there's a management transition underway in the industry where older CIOs are retiring and incoming (younger) executives are more comfortable with outsourcing. Second, it's getting harder for banks to recruit and retain the IT talent they need to maintain the systems. Third, the increasing complexity of bank IT systems is making it a riskier proposition to go it alone – the biggest of the big aren't in much danger, but I believe at least some of those 100-plus largest banks will turn to outsourcing in the coming years. FIS has always been a highly acquisitive company, but the acquisition of Sungard in 2015 was a bigger swing than most (with an enterprise value of over $9 billion). Sungard offers a lot to FIS, including a greatly expanded exposure to asset/wealth management companies and capital market players (traders, market makers, and so on). Prior to the deal, Sungard served around 90% of the 50 largest banks and 80% of the largest asset managers and insurance companies, and Sungard has already provided access and cross-selling opportunities to FIS for its banking offerings to some of these customers. So not only does Sungard expand FIS's total addressable market (with its offerings in trading software, data/network services, trade execution, analytics, corporate liquidity, risk management and so forth), it creates cross-selling opportunities. Sungard also offers synergy potential, and that's no trivial detail. FIS has been an active acquirer for a long time and has earned a reputation for being quite good at achieving its synergy targets, but management is outdoing itself so far with Sungard. This deal is already on target for 60% better cost synergies than FIS's original guidance, and this is pointing the way toward improving margin leverage in the years to come. One other worthwhile driver to note with FIS is overseas growth. FIS generates around three-quarters of its revenue in the U.S., and about 10% from Latin America and Asia-Pacific (combined), but markets like Brazil and India offer above-average long-term growth potential. Many of the drivers relevant to U.S. banks apply here (aging IT systems, increasing regulation, increasing customer demand for more sophisticated offerings), but there is the added kicker of underlying growth as many emerging market economies are significantly under-banked. All of that said, there are challenges FIS has to address. I think you could argue that FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry haven't been among the most dynamic innovators in the outsourced IT space. While I'll grant that banking is a more conservative market where there may be quite a bit of skepticism toward new mousetraps, I think it is critical for FIS to drive innovation if they are to convince large banks that they will be better served outsourcing to FIS than building proprietary internal systems. FIS also has some challenges from the nature of the market(s) it serves. The EMV conversion spurred growth in its payments business, but that has slowed significantly as that conversion process has matured. It's also well worth noting that banking really isn't a growth business in the U.S. anymore – more banks (at least among the $1B+ asset group) are closing branches than opening branches, the U.S. is certainly not under-banked, and M&A is a risk factor as it shrinks the addressable market. That said, given FIS's focus on larger banks, it seems to me that they're incrementally more likely to be on the side of the buyers (good) than the sellers (bad) relative to Fiserv and Jack Henry. Revenue growth this year and next is likely to be lackluster on an as-reported basis, with underlying growth more in the neighborhood of 3% as the company digests the tougher EMV comps, the sale of 60% of its Capco consulting business, and the still-sluggish underlying banking market. As spreads improve and banks move past their regulatory challenges, though, I expect growth to re-accelerate into the mid-single digits and support long-term growth in the 3% to 4% range. On the margin side, the Sungard synergies and enhanced operating leverage should help drive FCF margins into the 20%'s in the relatively near future and support high single-digit to low double-digit long-term FCF growth.Discounting those cash flows back to present, I think a fair value in the mid-to-high $90s is appropriate for FIS today, which means okay (but not outstanding) upside from here. That said, momentum should be returning to the business and a few beat-and-raise quarters could lead to upgraded growth assumptions (not to mention improved sentiment). I do worry that FIS is a little too popular; the stock has been strong, and it's well-liked (and well-covered) by the sell-side. Even so, though, it seems like the expectations baked into today's price are conservative, and FIS looks like a solid option in an expensive market that can further leverage the improving operating environment for banks.

58242,20138,2008-01-06T06:17:00-05:00,,"In a recent edition of Value Investor Insight, investor Larry Robbins offered insights on navigating today's skittish markets. Among specific ideas he believes the market is mispricing: Fidelity National Information (NYSE:FIS)."
1491262,20991,2013-06-10T10:49:03-04:00,,"This article was originally published on June 7I’m at a conference on the underbanked this week, where it’s basically impossible to swing a cat without running into someone talking about mRDC, which stands for mobile remote deposit capture. Or, in English, the ability to cash a check using your smartphone.A lot of bigger banks have had this ability for a while now: take a photo of a check using your phone, and you don’t need to bring it into a branch in order to deposit it. (And some of the bigger banks can make that process quite frustrating.) This is just a mobile way of depositing your check - it then enters into the standard banking system, and it will clear when it clears.People with prepaid debit cards, however, who live on a much tighter cashflow model, can’t afford to just sit around waiting for their checks to clear. If the check in question is a paycheck, then they want - they need - that money now. Virtually all prepaid debit cards do everything they can to persuade people to convert their paper paycheck into an electronic direct deposit, which appears on the card immediately, but habits are hard to break, and there’s still a very strong consumer preference for being paid in some kind of physical form. And in any case, checks can come from many different sources, many of which would find it difficult or inconvenient to try to transfer the money electronically.In the real world, check-cashing stores have sprung up in tens of thousands of locations to scratch this particular itch: take a check into the store, which is conveniently located and open late, and convert it directly into cash. Supermarkets are generally happy to offer the service too. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), for instance, will do it for a flat fee of $3.When you’re cashing a check in person, there’s a natural fraud-detection device - the human who’s handing over the greenbacks - which is hard to replicate in a mobile setting where everything is done through OCR algorithms. The overwhelming majority of check fraud is perpetrated by the depositor: if I try to deposit a bad check, or a check I’ve already deposited elsewhere, then I’m almost certainly doing so knowingly. It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to attempt that in person - much more than it does to attempt it by trying to put money onto a prepaid debit card.Still, as check-cashing services have grown, a company called FIS (NYSE:FIS) has built up a substantial business by offering a service which allows check-cashers to outsource all of their fraud detection, and taking all that risk onto its own balance sheet. Send a check off to FIS, and it will happily - for a modest fee - turn that check into ready cash, and it’s pretty much agnostic as to whether that check comes from a check-cashing storefront, or a supermarket, or a phone app. There might be slightly more fraud coming from phones than from storefronts, but FIS is big and experienced enough to be able to cope with that and weed that fraud out.As a result, underbanked Americans who want to turn their checks into immediate spendable money can now do so more easily than ever, directly from their phones - something which is even easier than going to a storefront. Providers of prepaid debit cards can now contract with FIS to turn mobile-uploaded checks into cash, and then can put that cash irrevocably onto their customers’ cards. If the check ends up bouncing, or otherwise being bad, that’s FIS’s problem: neither the customer nor the card provider loses any money. Everything is done through the prepaid card’s mobile app, which simply makes calls on FIS’s API.And what if your prepaid card provider hasn’t signed up with FIS? No worry: another company, called InGo, is here to help. If you have a prepaid Visa (NYSE:V) card, you can download the InGo app and use that to upload your check; you can then deposit cash immediately onto the prepaid card of your choice. If you’re willing to wait 7 days, the service is free, but most customers choose to receive immediate funds; the fees there are 1% for payroll and government checks, or 4% for all other checks. Those fees are highly competitive with check-cashers. Not only is InGo more convenient than a corner store, it’s also cheaper.Most encouragingly, the use of mRDC, because it keeps people out of check-cashing stores, might well cut down on the amount of payday lending. Check cashing per se is not a massive drain of funds for the underbanked, although it can add up over time. But when you regularly go to a store to cash your paycheck, and you know that store is willing to advance you money against that paycheck when it’s coming to you in a week’s time, then it becomes very tempting to get your money not immediately, as soon as you receive it, but rather in advance. And that’s where check cashing can become usurious payday lending.It’s a depressing yet undeniable fact that paper checks aren’t going anywhere, in the US. Even as they’ve become obsolescent everywhere else, they’re still ubiquitous here - and that fact has been a serious obstacle to helping banking go fully mobile. But now that FIS and InGo are cashing checks straight onto prepaid debit cards, what used to be an obstacle can now become a competitive advantage. Prepaid can go overnight from being the place where you can’t deposit a check into your account, to being the easiest place to deposit a check into your account.I’m hopeful that as part of this trend, check cashing will stop being a significant expense for the underbanked, and will instead be a way for mobile banking operators and the prepaid industry to compete with each other in terms of convenience. Already, if you’re a Gobank customer, and you deposit a check into your account, the money will arrive immediately - and Gobank won’t charge you a penny, at the margin. (Although they will surely hope that you will pay for it in another way, through your voluntary monthly fee.)Most of the unbanked have smartphones, now - which means that smartphones should be able to disrupt check-cashing stores long before checks themselves become obsolete. That’s going to help take financial services for the underbanked out of the control of the payday-loan industry, and into the control of nimbler and more competitive mobile-native companies who are more interested in scale than they are in extracting rents from the poor. Which should be good for everybody."

In the run up to the earnings report, there  have not been any variations in analyst estimates.Fourth Quarter 2010 HighlightsFidelity reported strong fourth quarter 2010 results, with revenue  increasing 7.6% year over year to $1.4 billion (6.1% organically),  primarily driven by strong results from Financial Solutions and  International Solutions.During the quarter, earnings, on a non-GAAP basis, from continuing  operations jumped 42.2% year over year to 64 cents per share from 45  cents reported in the prior-year quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of 60 cents.In fiscal 2010, revenue increased 4.2% year over year (3.2%  organically) to $5.20 billion. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis increased  22.4% year over year to $2.02 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $1.98.For further details, please refer to Fidelity Beats on Strong Revenue.First quarter 2011 and FY 2011 EstimatesFor the first quarter ending March 31, 2011, Fidelity expects earnings  per share (EPS) in the range of 44-46 cents (up 7.0-12.0% year over  year). The guidance was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45  cents. The current quarter EPS expectation takes into account increased  integration charges related to the company’s Metavante and Capco  acquisitions.Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.36-1.38 billion for the  quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is pegged  at $1.37 billion for the first quarter, which is in line with  management’s guided range. For the quarter, Fidelity expects EBITDA in  the range of $370.0-380.0 million.For full-year 2011, Fidelity continues to expect adjusted earnings per  share from continuing operations of $2.24-2.34, up 11.0-16.0% from  $2.02 in fiscal 2010. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged  at $2.32, roughly in line with the high end of the guided range.Total revenue is expected to grow 9.0-11.0% (4.0-6.0%  organically) for fiscal 2011 and EBITDA is projected to increase 7.0-9.0%. Fidelity expects $48.0 million of cost savings in fiscal 2011.Estimate Revision Trend Of the 16 analysts providing estimates for the upcoming quarter, none made any changes in their estimates in the last 30 days.For fiscal 2011, only one analyst made an upward revision in the last 30 days (out of the 16 analysts covering the stock) and as a  result, the EPS estimate for fiscal 2011 increased by a penny from $2.31  to $2.32.ConclusionWe maintain our Neutral rating for Fidelity on a long-term basis (for  the next six to 12 months), primarily due to an increasing debt and  intense competition from such companies Fiserv Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV), IBM and Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN).In our view, the increasing consolidation in the banking sector, a  challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business, and an  uncertain regulatory environment are the primary business headwinds.  However, going forward, continued market share gains, global expansion, a  strong product portfolio and cost synergies will drive earnings and  revenue.In general, the first quarter is a seasonally weaker period for  Fidelity; hence we remain cautious on a near-term basis. However, we  expect 2011 results to be positively impacted by the company’s strong  organic growth and international expansion.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks #4 Rank, which implies a short-term Sell rating (for the next one to three months)."

Shares of FIS are trading at a multiple of 12.0x our fiscal 2010 EPS estimate of $1.96, a discount to the industry.The company’s fourth-quarter 2009 earnings marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, benefiting from cost-cutting efforts and operating efficiency gains, as well as higher revenue in the international solutions segment. FIS reiterated its 2010 guidance.Fidelity has been an active acquirer of companies, and we believe the Metavante acquisition will offer both top-line growth and cost synergies with increased operating leverage. We are encouraged by FIS’ prospects, given the broad range of offerings of the combined company, as well as the acquisition of Metavante.New customer signings, increased presence in international markets, incremental cross-selling opportunities and stabilization in end-market demand will also drive growth.Although we believe that the company has the potential to grow at a healthy rate over the next few years, a declining market for check services and a slow recovery in the mortgage market concern us, since they could hurt sales. Moreover, FIS has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have been eating up its balance sheet in the form of high levels of goodwill and intangible assets.We believe FIS has held up better than most of its peers, despite a highly challenging economic environment. We expect the company to post stronger results in 2010 driven by improving IT spending.By successfully integrating acquired companies, FIS has reported stronger sales, which along with cost management and core & ancillary product integration, enabled it to generate pro forma revenue of more than $5 billion and pro-forma EBITDA of more than $1.4 billion (28% of total revenue) in 2009.For the longer-term, the company expects overall revenue growth of 6% to 9%. Management believes the company will continue to drive strong revenue growth and higher profitability through new revenue sources, new product development and technology enhancements, long-term contracts, an improved sales force, leveraging of customer relations and cross–selling of products across business lines, focus on large deals and lowering of the expense base.As such, we have a Neutral rating on FIS shares with a price target of $25.00. This represents a P/E multiple of 12.8x estimated 2010 EPS, which is a discount to its peers.FIS is a leading provider of banking and payments technology solutions, processing services and information-based services to the financial services industry.

Background On May 6, 2010, the Wall Street Journal reported that FIS was in talks with the Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX)and THL Partners, two private equity firms, about a leveraged buyout in the $10-11 billion range. The stock jumped on the announcement, and moved even higher after rumors surfaced that another private equity firm wanted in on the deal as well. News organizations increased their estimates to more than $15 billion, making it potentially the largest leveraged buyout since the start of the credit crisis. However, on May 18, the deal fell through and the company decided to pursue a leveraged recapitalization plan and substantial share repurchase instead. Announcement On May 25, the company released a statement outlining the terms of the recapitalization plan: As stated in the news release, our Board of Directors has authorized a plan under which our Company will repurchase up to $2.5 billion of its common stock at a price range of between $29.00 – $31.00 per share through a modified “Dutch auction” tender offer. In order to effect the proposed recapitalization, we intend to borrow approximately $2.5 billion of incremental debt. FIS is in a strong financial position and generates significant free cash flow, so we are very comfortable with the proposed debt levels that we will incur in repurchasing the company stock. Odd-Lot Provision Although the final price level and number of shares purchased will be determined by the dutch auction, the tender offer provides priority to ‘odd lot’ shareholders of less than 100 shares. Even if the offering is oversubscribed, this provision ensures small shareholders will receive a full cash-out without any proration, a great opportunity for the average investor. Timeline May 25: FIS announces details about the proposed recapitalization plan and self-tender offer. July 6: The company sells $1.1 billion in Notes to qualified institutional buyers, the main condition for the share repurchase July 6: FIS commences the tender offer. July 16: Proposed closing of $1.1 billion Note offering August 3: Conclusion of the tender offer Late August: Shareholders who validly tender their shares will be cashed out at the final auction price, with priority for the ‘odd lot’ shareholders defined above. Return Scenarios As of July 9, I’m adding FIS to my ValueUncovered portfolio using the latest closing price of $27.70.  Final Tender Price TBD Conclusion The deal offers attractive annualized returns for a month long trade. Although there is always risks with such a large transaction, FIS is very well capitalized and I don’t forsee any problems with the offer going through. I think Frank Martire, the company’s President & CEO, says it best: The recapitalization plan is consistent with our commitment to doing what is in the best interests of our company, our clients and our shareholders. Our strong financial position, combined with appropriate market conditions and our excellent relationships with lenders, make this the right move at the right time. Disclosure: Author is long FIS"

4379371,104695,2020-10-16T10:00:00-04:00,Fiserv and Fidelity National Information Services are both leading financial service technology providers in the core banking and payment processing industry with broad product and service portfolios and highly recurring revenues with financial institutions.FISV and FIS are seeking to capitalize on the digital transformation in the financial industry and are building end-to-end solutions through the acquisitions of First Data and Worldpay.Fiserv’s advantage stems from its wider portfolio breadth and deeper relationships with smaller banks and credit unions driving solid growth.FIS has a relatively larger exposure to bigger banks which are expected to ramp up their modernization initiatives to counter emerging competition from new fintech entrants.Revenues of both companies are expected to grow by more than 10% annually.,"Source: Fiserv, FISFiserv Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) are leading financial service technology providers. At the of heart of it, both companies' business models specialize in providing core banking processing solutions to financial institutions to conduct their day-to-day operations. Due to high switching costs and multiyear contracts, it provides steady cash flows and highly recurring revenue streams.Boasting decades of market experience, both companies have their unique reasons to own their stock. Fiserv has the widest product breadth allowing it to attain a massive client base. Its clients mix is relatively more geared towards smaller-size banks and credit unions. These firms choose Fiserv as their one-stop technology provider, while FIS has a bigger exposure to larger banks that choose it for its flexibility and strong product family integration capabilities. As incumbent banks ramp up their modernization initiatives to fend off competition from emerging fintech players. Besides that, both companies have also expanded into rapidly growing payments solutions to build up an end-to-end solution for clients in the wake of a digital transformation of financial services.A core banking system is utilized by financial institutions to process daily banking transactions and post updates to accounts and financial records. These typically include deposit, loan and credit processing solutions integrated to general ledger systems. They also include other value-added customer relationship management solutions which are essential for maintaining bank to client relationships.The core banking market is highly competitive and is led by Fiserv, Fidelity National Information Services and Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY). These firms have decades of experience and cumulatively account for over 70% of market share. Their long-term stability has been attributable to their core banking solutions forming the legacy systems in most financial institutions today. The importance to prevent disruption to daily operations means that switching costs are very high, providing additional stability to these firms.Source: FedFisNevertheless, the core banking systems market is transforming as banks digitalize. The emerging developments of open banking from new fintech entrants mean that the incumbent financial institutions must ramp up their technology initiatives despite legacy barriers. According to eMarketer, the US bank IT budget has grown to $64 bln in 2019. We forecast the strength to continue and expect banks' IT expenditures to reach over $100bln by 2025, representing a CAGR of 8.85%. Several factors supporting this estimate are:Source: eMarketer, Khaveen InvestmentsTo implement this transformation, banks which traditionally relied on in-house capabilities may consider migrating to third-party providers which offers cost benefits due to scale. These institutions are expected to implement targeted modernization initiatives to capitalize on new opportunities, motivated by the need for business agility, compliance and channel enablement. Therefore, this would benefit core banking vendors including FISV and FIS.FiservAs a core banking provider, Fiserv is the best in class with over 4,000 financial institutions including credit unions and banks of all sizes implementing Fiserv's core technology. Compared to FIS, its client mix has a larger exposure to credit unions, making up about 40% of total clients. About one third of US credit unions depend on Fiserv for their core account processing needs. Two primary reasons explain Fiserv's market leadership, its superior number of core deployments and the breadth of its product portfolio. The completeness of its core offerings allows it to meet the needs of any financial institution, which is especially important for smaller firms that look to Fiserv to be their primary technology partner.Fiserv leads the market in the number of core offerings which is the highest amongst competitors. Under its Financial segment, Fiserv provides a range of highly functional and scalable accounts processing and item processing services. Its primary offerings are DNA, Premier, Cleartouch, Portico, Precision and Signature. These solutions enable financial institutions to handle customer deposits and loan accounts, general ledger and other financial information.Overall, we believe its competitive advantage among credit unions and smaller banks lies in its product portfolio breadth. This drives most financial institutions to choose Fiserv as its technology partner, especially the smaller institutions, allowing the firm to achieve a massive client base. Its strategy is to maintain its base through cross-selling and upselling; for example, selling account processing to clients who are on its credit processing solutions. This allows the firm to deepen its client relationships, and it signs multiyear contracts which will result in high switching costs and deter substitution to competitors. Thus, we are optimistic on Fiserv's core banking prospects as its clients will likely choose the firm for their digitalization initiatives and estimate growth to be line with the market at 8.85%.FISCompared to FISV, FIS is second in the core banking solutions market. It serves a smaller client base; over 1,000 financial institutions are using its core banking platforms. Although it serves all financial institutions including banks of all sizes and credit unions, its specialization is with larger banks. More than 70 of its clients have assets over $10 bln, while Fiserv has less than half than that.Source: Aite GroupThe firm's advantage with larger banks stems from its higher level of customization and integration capabilities of its core offerings. Its primary core offerings are IBS, Profile, Systematics and Horizon. These solutions offer a range of configuration suites while enabling timely product to market by banks. In terms of architecture, FIS has been credited for its open architecture allowing for greater integration as well as the ability to incorporate value-added solutions such as data analytics capabilities providing cross-selling and upselling opportunities.Thus, although both FISV and FIS products similarly cater to all types and sizes of financial institutions, FIS has developed an advantage over Fiserv with its core integration strength allowing it to achieve larger exposure to banking segments. Moreover, FIS has deployed a Modern Banking Platform comprising an integrated core platform delivering an omnichannel banking experience. The platform is designed to leverage the emerging open banking trend and may provide a boost to the firm's growth.We believe FIS's larger exposure to bigger banks relative to Fiserv is positive. Despite higher bargaining power from customers, modernization initiatives by larger banks could be a key driver for the firm. Traditionally, large incumbent banks face barriers to digitalization initiatives because of strong reliance on proven solutions. However, the rising competition from emerging fintech entrants may push a modernization drive. Larger banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BofA (NYSE:BAC) are likely to increase technology spend in the coming years according to a survey from UBS Evidence Lab. Thus, we expect FIS's Financial segment to outpace Fiserv at 9.22% due to its larger bank exposure, assuming a ramp-up of tech spend of 0.5% of assets.Both Fiserv and FIS have expanded into the payments processing market with the acquisition of First Data by Fiserv and Worldpay by FIS. Merchant acquiring or payment processing enables payment acceptance on behalf of merchants with credit, debit cards and mobile wallets. The market was valued at $33.45 bln in 2019. We project it to grow at CAGR of 14%, which is in line with non-cash transaction growth estimates by Capgemini. This is driven by evolving customer preferences for cashless payments and e-commerce. Processors are also leveraging cloud-based technologies for seamless integration as well as machine learning and AI in fraud detection and data analytics. The market consists of several large institutions with FIS (Worldpay), Chase and Fiserv (First Data) leading the market handling over $1 tln in transactions annually each.Source: Nilson ReportFiservThe acquisition of First Data, a leader in merchant acquiring, provides Fiserv integration opportunities with its payments segment for card-based processing while opening a new market for it in rapidly growing payments acceptance space.Source: FiservThe combined company provides several benefits by enabling value creation for account processing clients and deepening relationships. The firm is seeking to link their respective merchant and cash capabilities and develop new offerings. This creates a differentiated, end-to-end payments platform from issuance to acceptances, also enabling additional payment methods. Highly complementary products and distribution channels allow for cross-selling opportunities. For example, First data's Clover POS system for commercial clients and biller solutions from Fiserv.First Data has already made a huge impact on Fiserv, contributing 40% of revenues. In the long term, the firm expects to achieve revenue synergies of $500 mln and cost savings of $900mln from an enriched value proposition through integration of technology infrastructure, expanded payment offerings and integrated sales.The combination of both companies could effectively create a payments powerhouse in the long term. We expect its segments to grow in line with payment processing market growth of 14%, as the integration solidifies Fiserv's existing payment services including electronic bill payments, account-to-account transfers, P2P payments, debit and credit card processing services, thereby allowing the firm to capitalize on the increasing trends towards digital, real-time and secure payments.FISSimilar to Fiserv, the acquisition of Worldpay provides product integration opportunities. It is reported under its Merchant segment and accounts for nearly 20% of revenues, enabling merchants to accept electronic payments at the physical POS as well as online and mobile payments. We believe the key advantage of the FIS-Worldpay acquisition could be derived from its relationships with banks and a strong focus on open development tools in the open banking era. As open banking and faster payments grow, there is an increasing importance of the ability to offer end-to-end solutions.Source: FISBy taking advantage of its highly configurable portfolio with strong product family integration capabilities, we believe FIS can combine financial services, processing and risk management powered by a robust network. Moreover, the emergence of open banking would also result in the need for secure data sharing. Regulations such as Europe's PSD2 could be a major catalyst for FIS for its security solutions, which it could use to leverage its relationships with banks and Worldpay with its familiarity with European markets.Overall, the merger of Worldpay with FIS provides size and scale to accelerate growth, and we expect this segment to grow in line with our market estimates of 14%. Compared with Fiserv, FIS has deep relationships with large banks on top of a highly differentiated product portfolio in the wake of open banking. The combination enables an end-to-end payment solution and multiple cross-selling opportunities. For example, executing both transaction and ledger settlement. In the long term, FIS expects to achieve revenue synergies of $500 mln and cost savings of $400 mln from operational synergies and technology integration.Net DebtIn terms of debt, the acquisitions by Fiserv and FIS are one of their largest deals ever, resulting in elevated debt levels in both companies since the past year. Fiserv has a higher net debt of $42 bln compared to FIS at $30 bln, suggesting a higher financial risk for the company.Source: Fiserv, FISHowever, both Fiserv and FIS maintain healthy EBITDA interest coverage ratios. Fiserv's EBITDA interest coverage ratio stood at 5.3x in 2019, while FIS had a slightly better ratio at 5.8x, indicating strong abilities to service debt for both companies. In addition, both companies have strong earnings and cash flow generation abilities.MarginsFiserv's earnings and margins have generally outperformed FIS. Its revenue has grown steadily at an average rate of 12.2% in the past nine years with a gross and net margin of 48.36% and 5.77% respectively in 2019. Excluding its acquisition of First Data, it has an average free cash flow margin of 15.84%, which is slightly higher than FIS.Source: FiservFIS's revenues have grown 8.61% in the past nine years with a gross margin and net margin of 36.03% and 2.66% respectively in 2019. Excluding its acquisition of Worldpay, it has an average free cash flow margin of 11.47%.Source: FISRevenueSource: Fiserv, FISTo value both companies, we use a DCF analysis by projecting both companies' revenue growth. Revenue growth in 2019 for both firms were significantly higher due to the recognition of revenues of the combined entities. We expect Fiserv's revenue to grow at a slightly higher rate than FIS at 10.6% due mainly to its relatively larger exposure to payments with First Data segment accounting for a higher share of revenues compared to FIS. Though we expect FIS's core banking segment to outperform Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsRelative ValuationSource: Seeking AlphaDCFBased on a DCF analysis, with an EV/EBITDA multiple of 23.71x (Core and Payment Processing Industry average) and a discount rate of 6.9% (company WACC), while assuming revenue growth of 10.6% before tapering off at a long-term growth assumption of 6% due to its highly recurring nature of revenues, our model shows an upside of 31.36% for Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsFor FIS, based on an EV/EBITDA of 23.71x, we applied a discount rate of 8% (company WACC) and a revenue growth rate of 10.64% before tapering out at a long-term growth rate of 6%, our model shows a smaller upside of 6.39% compared to Fiserv.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsAs market leaders, both companies have solid portfolio breadth and deep relationships with clients built on decades of expertise and are two top picks to ride out the digitalization of banking. However, we believe Fiserv edges out FIS slightly. This stems from its wider product portfolio, enabling it to attain a larger client base compared to FIS. Its deeper relationships with smaller institutions and credit unions should provide steady growth ahead as they would continue choosing Fiserv as their main technology partner. Thus, its larger and diversified client base minimizes the risks to the company. On the other hand, despite its smaller base, FIS has been credited for its strong integration capabilities and product customization, which makes it a favored provider by banks. As larger banks undergo modernization initiatives, FIS should benefit from its larger exposure to this segment. Though, the higher bargaining power of larger clients could negatively affect the company, while Fiserv's smaller client base has a lower bargaining power.To conclude, notwithstanding the risk of declining financial institutions because of mergers and acquisitions and strong competition from other vendors, rapid digitalization and emergence of open banking are creating a need for end-to-end solutions.Both Fiserv and FIS are seeking to capitalize on this by leveraging their existing capabilities and acquisitions such as payments. Despite Fiserv's slight advantage, we rate both Fiserv and FIS as a Buy with a target price of $113.03 (FISV) and $155.88 (FIS).Note: For more research and analysis of high-quality companies within the global fintech industry, please click the ""Follow"" icon at the top of this page."
4316984,105417,2020-01-15T10:31:22-05:00,"We are raising the target price from $123 to $143, with our 2020 guidance optimistic and expectations for 4Q earnings intact.
        2020 should become first and foremost a free cash flow story for Fiserv.
        Mobile opportunities remain ironclad.","In our last Article on Fiserv (FISV), we discussed the phenomenon of bank consolidation and how we did not view it as a threat for Fiserv as a company. Now, we are moving away from the industry discussion and previewing the quarter, in addition to discussing our expectations for 2020 guidance. Based on our strong outlook, we are raising our target price from $123 to $143. Recall that FISV is a provider of financial services technology, working with banks, credit unions, and investment management firms, among other clients. Fiserv provides account processing systems, ACH enablement, and card processing services.The primary companies in the comps peer group remain Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), which, together with a few other financial outsourcing names, jointly yield our 2020 EPS multiple of ~24x. We are changing our valuation from EV/EBITDA to P/E in order to better reflect the presence of share buybacks in 2020. When we apply it to our 2020 EPS estimate of $6.03, we get the target price of $143 (up from $123). Revenue and EPS: We expect the company to report internal revenue growth of 5.2% Y/Y, driven by continued strength in payments and mobile. We also expect adjusted EPS of $1.07, approximately 5 cents higher than in 3Q. Overall, this quarterly profile is in line with mid-single-digit top line growth and mid-teens bottom line growth expectations. Breaking down the revenue segments: The good news is that Fiserv remains a fairly well balanced business, since we are not seeing one segment entirely contributing to the P&L. Specifically, for 4Q, we expect Payments business to grow 6.4% Y/Y, Financial business to grow 4.5% Y/Y, and First Data to contribute 4.9% Y/Y. Further good news is that we expect each of these businesses to accelerate 20-50 bps in 2020. The company may choose not to include such traction in annual guidance right away, but rather may choose for it to be reflected in subsequent raises.Slight adjusted margin expansion: Further, we anticipate a slight margin expansion, at 29.3%, approximately 20 bps higher than in 3Q. We see this margin improvement as a mix of a slight decline in SG&A and a revenue improvement. Expect stronger FCF conversion in 2020: As we contemplate 2020 guidance, we first and foremost consider free cash flows and its conversion. Specifically, we anticipate as much as 120%-125% in conversion for 2020, a high figure that does not appear too high if we consider that the latest 2019 guidance calls for 115%. This figure is important because it signals the company's commitment to potentially another large transaction. In addition, it reinforces another strong year for share buybacks and a likely increase in authorization (we estimate: at least $300 MM). Finally, with no dividend on the horizon at present, perhaps this outlook may change toward the end of 2020.Mobile opportunities to remain ironclad: We estimate as much as 27% Y/Y revenue growth related to mobile, which is a sizable impact, given the company's only mid-single digit overall top-line profile. Increasing exposure to bulge-bracket clients: In 2020, we should continue to see more secular shift toward large banks, such as Wells Fargo, from credit unions and mid-cap banks. This should help accelerate revenue by 30-50 bps in 2020 (though may come in at the low end of the range, depending on when the first contracts are recognized). Margin-wise there shouldn't be a noticeable difference, however.Business risks remain unchanged, though we slightly modified them.1. Security breaches could harm the FISV business, always risking the breach of client contracts.2. While the revenue base is sticky for Fiserv, potential recessionary risks may create some headwinds for the company. 3. Regulatory environment could exacerbate and potentially lead to various internal investigations."
4333609,105417,2020-03-23T10:01:11-04:00,"We discuss three companies in the payments business that remain solid SHORT names in the bear market.We continued to see Western Union as a pressured, with the anachronistic offline model pressuring revenues.We view Qiwi as struggling with business development, particularly in the brave new world of the coronavirus pandemic.Finally, we highlight Fiserv as a company that may face softness from the international opportunities.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.The onset of a possible recession or (if we are lucky) a severe downturn without technically slipping into a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth) is certain to bring a plethora of short names. In surveying various payments stocks, we sought to identify those players who, in our view, would underperform the S&P and would thus undergo a more severe impact than the average market. We identify three short names below that, in our view, are bear candidates with a time horizon of 12-18 months.For each of these names, we briefly remind our readers the business of each company, offer three core tailwinds, and discuss the valuation. This note ends with a risk section (to our bear thesis) for these payments companies.Western Union is mainly responsible for money transfer transactions between customers (C2C business), albeit it also facilitates payments from consumers to business (bill pay), which makes up about 10-15% of its business. Note that the core C2C business stands at more than 80%. When it comes to Western Union, the most important factor to stress is that it is one of the few global companies that operates in an offline environment when most business models around the world today are going digital. As a result, our thesis has historically been a short one, which in this current exacerbating economic environment becomes an even louder short.We see three core headwinds for Western Union (WU):1) Lower Pricing From Online Competitors: Now, more than ever, the threat of digital/online model becomes relevant, having the potential of transforming Western Union's business, as we know it. We have maintained for years that the offline money transfer model is 1) costly; 2) anachronistic; and 3) cumbersome, with the most loyal customers barely driving the low single digit transaction growth. In contrast, online transaction growth at PayPal (powered by Xoom), Euronet Worldwide, and Western Union's own Wu.com is in double digits, usually at least 20% Y/Y. Meanwhile, the average transaction offline transaction fee is $18 (for every $1,000 of remittances), in contrast to $5-7 per transaction rate via the online channel. As income streams are reduced and as remittance levels fall, pricing will become the inevitable sticking point!2) Bottom Line Noise to Continue: Western Union's cost issues couldn't come at a worse time, since incremental spending on KYC (know your customer) and KYA (know your agent) initiatives is likely to further disrupt the EPS. A potential offset to these pressures shall likely come in the form of layoffs and restructuring, but reduction of revenue and its impact on EPS is expected to be far greater.3) Buybacks to Be Phased Out: Western Union has historically been a generous purchaser of its own stock, buying back as much as 3% of total shares outstanding. With the cash flows now likely redirected toward supporting revenue-driving initiatives, we believe that Western Union will dramatically cut back on buybacks, eventually phasing them out by 2021.Valuation: We are taking down our 2020 EPS estimate from $1.87 to $1.61. When we apply the multiple of 10x to this new estimate, our new target price is $16 (down from $20).QIWI is a provider of payment services in Russia and former Soviet Republics, focusing on physical, online and mobile channels. The company deploys virtual wallets via kiosks and terminals, enabling merchants to accept electronic payments. We continue to be Bearish on this name and are taking our target price down to $8 (from $16) for the following three reasons:1) Saturation of the Tochka Platform: We see saturation of what is arguably Qiwi's prized platform throughout 2020, leading to a 8-12% Y/Y decline in sales. Even without recent downturn, Tochka's appeal was on the decline, but with the onset of recessionary pressures in Russia and Eastern Europe (which is likely to be exacerbated by falling oil prices), we see Tochka deteriorating even further.2) Marketing Costs as a Bridge to Nowhere: While we applaud management's decision to make Qiwi services more prevalent outside of Russia, among the former Soviet Republics, it is our understanding that true growth in business development has been less than 1% Y/Y in 2019 and is unlikely to increase in 2020, in the aftermath of the coronavirus scare. Therefore, we are talking about $35-$40 MM annually in marketing expenses that is hitting the bottom line.3) Expect Dividend Reduction: While a reduction in buybacks and dividends may become a prevalent scenario in the near term, we see this scenario even more likely for Qiwi, which currently has the burden of maintaining a dividend yield as high as 8%. We did not see it sustainable last year and we do not see it sustainable now in particular.Valuation: We see the multiple of 5.2x (down from 9x) as appropriate at present, as the company struggles to address longer term business development issues and a saturation in demand. When we apply this multiple to our 2020 EPS estimate of $1.62, we get the target price of $8.Fiserv is a global provider of financial services technology to banks, credit unions, investment management firms, billers, and retailers, among others. The company provides account processing systems, electronic bill payment and presentment services, as well as card processing services and ACH enablement. We have been one of the staunchest defenders of the stock, but with the onset of coronavirus, we see that the revenue hit may become prolonged for some workstreams.We discuss the three reasons for our Short thesis below:1) Mid-Caps to Scale Back: Unlike bulge bracket firms, mid-cap regional banks, which make up the bulk of Fiserv's client base, are likely to scale back on some non-essential FISV work, such as ATM extensions or online backups. We estimate that as much as 12% of annual revenue may get impacted under the most aggressive scenario and 4.5% under the most conservative scenario. We are using the midpoint of this range for our valuation, which translates into an annual hit of 24 cents (see the valuation discussion below).2) International Revenue Streams Freezing: While the situation is still developing and is largely chaotic, our initial channel checks indicate that non-US operations have meaningfully slowed down over the course of the previous week and are likely to come to a complete halt by late March. This means that nearly 12% of Fiserv's total revenue base is under threat, particularly with the company never truly considering these businesses as truly core to its overall business. We are not modeling any EPS impact just yet (our information is mostly qualitative), but we may choose to revisit the model in the near future.3) Capital Return to Wither: This is a very similar story to Western Union's. As capital priorities shift for Fiserv, we expect more reinvestments and fewer buybacks. We do not anticipate that the company will forego share repurchases altogether; rather, we expect them to constitute anywhere between 20% to 35% of total free cash flows (down from about 80%).Valuation: When we apply our new 2020 PE multiple of 12.5x (down from 24x, largely to reflect the market multiple contraction) to our new 2020 EPS estimate of $5.79 (down from $6.03), we get the target price of $72.We would like to highlight the following three risks to our Bearish thesis.1. This would obviously be a much-needed resolution for the mankind, but a faster-than-expected return to normalcy from the coronavirus scare would lead to us reevaluate our Bear thesis (which we would be more than happy to do).2. Despite economic disruption to Fiserv and Qiwi, we could see consumer demand as more inelastic than we currently expect, which would lead to better earnings results.3. Pricing stabilization between Western Union, MoneyGram, and Euronet Worldwide could lead to an equilibrium that would prevent or at the very least lessen market share loss for Western Union."
4373675,105703,2020-09-11T05:46:29-04:00,"Fiserv is a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions.The company is seeing a rebound in revenue in recent months, and management has guided for strong earnings growth this year.Shares appear to be undervalued when considering the future growth estimates.","When it comes to investing in growth companies, finding the right timing can be hard, as the share price may seem to be perpetually overvalued. In this article, I’m focused on Fiserv (FISV) which has had an impressive run over the past five years. However, the share price has taken a dip recently, with a 17.5% decline on a YTD basis. I evaluate whether this presents an attractive buying opportunity; so let’s get started.(Source: Company website)Fiserv is a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, and handles millions of financial transactions per day. Its solutions work behind the scenes to connect financial institutions, corporations, merchants, and consumers to one another in a safe and reliable manner. It was founded more than 35 years ago when two regional processing companies joined forces to make it easier for banks to run and serve customers more efficiently. Today, it serves clients in over 100 countries, and last year, it generated over $10 billion in total revenue.What I like about Fiserv is that it has a long runway for growth, as the method in which consumers pay for everyday purchases continues to be streamlined with technology. This is supported by its recent announcement on Sep 1st that it has partnered with Amazon (AMZN) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) enabling voice command payments at more than 11,500 gas stations.In addition, Fiserv continues to expand its reach globally, as last month, it won the opportunity to work with Federal Bank, a private sector bank in India, to enable the digitization of the bank’s end-to-end card issuance and processing cycles. These opportunities allow Fiserv to further establish its reputation as a leading processing platform for businesses around the world.Last year, Fiserv merged with First Data, which owned the STAR Network, a provider of nationwide debit acceptance services. It has more than 2 million retail POS (point of sale), ATM, and Online outlets, covering nearly one-third of all U.S. debit cards. This merger created a lot of synergies and cost savings, as both businesses (pre-merger) have processes that run in parallel to one another. These benefits were noted by management on the last conference call:Like for many companies, COVID-19 has presented the company with risks and challenges. This is evidenced by the 7% YoY revenue decline that the company saw in its latest quarter. This was due to lower global transaction volumes due to the pandemic. What’s encouraging, however, is that management began to see a positive YoY trend starting with the month of July, as economic activity started to pick up. In addition, management had enough confidence in the business to provide 2020 EPS guidance in the amount of $4.33 per share, representing a 10% YoY increase.Another risk factor worth paying attention to is the elevated debt level, with long-term debt currently at $21.0B, and a Net Debt to EBITDA of 3.9x. However, management is committed to paying it down by $1.5B by the end of the year. I’m comfortable with this allocation, as the company has generated $3.5B in FCF over the past 12 months. In addition to debt repayments, the company is also repurchasing shares with a part of the remaining FCF. On a YTD basis, 14.3 million shares have been repurchased for $1.4 billion.Turning to valuation, it appears that analysts are expecting a slightly higher 2020 EPS than management’s guidance. In addition, the average estimated EPS annual growth rate through 2022 is 16%.Based on this information, I wanted to calculate what the PEG ratio is, with the following inputs:With the inputs above, I arrive at a PEG ratio of 1.34, which I view as attractive, especially given the well-established scale and scope of Fiserv’s business. At a PEG ratio of 2.0, the share price would be $141, which sits 48% above where the shares are trading at now. Analysts seem to agree that shares are undervalued, with an average price target of $125.Fiserv is a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions, and handles millions of financial transactions per day. It continues to expand partnerships and services with leading businesses and banks around the world. The company has realized a significant amount of synergies since acquiring First Data last year.While COVID-19 presents challenges, the monthly results since the end of the last quarter show that revenues are ramping back up. Meanwhile, the company is making good progress on paying down its debt, and returning capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks.As the valuation exercise demonstrated, I see the shares as being undervalued at the current price of $95 with a blended P/E of 22.2. For this, and the reasons stated above, I have a favorable view of the shares and see strong upside potential.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)"
4312712,105417,2019-12-16T09:06:11-05:00,"There has been a recent pattern of bank consolidation in the United States, but we see it as largely business as usually for Fiserv.Revenue workstreams are very sticky for Fiserv, with solid synergies created even in the aftermath of M&A of Fiserv's clients.We have less visibility into pricing, but channel checks didn't to any pressures.","No, the sky is not falling. Contrary to the popular wisdom, bank consolidation does not represent a threat to Fiserv and its peers in the financial technology industry. After briefly summarizing the company's business and the valuation, we share our key reasons for this contrarian assertion. A global provider of financial services technology, Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) has more than 12K clients worldwide, which include banks, credit unions, investment management firms, billers, and retailers, among others. The company provides account processing systems, electronic bill payment and presentment services, as well as card processing services and ACH enablement. The company generates about $6 billion in annual revenue, with processing and services revenue representing about 85% of the total. We note that FISV is mostly a US company, with more than 90% of revenue domestically-generated.Our primary companies in the comps peer group are Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), which jointly yield our 2020 EV/EBITDA market multiple of ~18x. At this point, we don't see further tailwinds to justify further multiple expansion, with valuation getting somewhat rich, though we still consider FISV shares a bullish case. When we apply it to our 2020 EBITDA estimate of $2,448 MM, we get the target price of $123.Recent Pattern of Bank Consolidation: Ever since the famous JP Morgan-Chase merger nearly two decades ago, we've seen this pattern in the financial services industry getting more and more pronounced: large banks acquiring smaller players, mid-cap banks merging, and large/mid-caps buying smaller players. In our view, this is a normal pattern/cycle during a bull market, as companies explore synergies and sometimes sell themselves to the highest bidder. Some on the Street, however, view bank consolidation as a potential loss of business to financial technology companies, such as FIS, Jack Henry, and particularly Fiserv.Customer Base Doesn't Shrink: One of the key consequences of consolidation is that the customer base doesn't shrink and, hence, demand for Fiserv's services after more than three dozen mergers among its clients stayed essentially the same. There were instances when the newly formed entity would shift from FIS or Jack Henry (from Fiserv), but there was an approximately the same number of instances when Fiserv was the beneficiary. Created Synergies: Such mergers, on the contrary, created synergistic opportunities, when Fiserv was able to increase workstreams in the following areas: 1) cash to card payments; 2) online-to-mobile conversions; 3) Mobiliti and Corillian extensions; 4) Integration with the Architect product and PopMoney; and, last but not least, 5) biller solutions with checkfree.com. Sticky Revenue Workstreams: We have done a thorough analysis of ""before"" and ""after"" acquisitions of various workstreams at Fiserv. Our findings indicate that not a single workstream that existed before the deal was later abandoned or even marginalized. We are talking about the back-end to debit and credit card transactions, ATM functionalities, and check/mobile transaction enablement. In other words, none of these workstreams are optional. They only became stronger in the aftermath of various deals. Fiserv was able to maintain its 4%-5% Y/Y revenue growth, with about 80% of revenue recurring and at about 20-30 bps acceleration. We also found that during the years of major mergers and acquisitions - FISV was able to accelerate its revenue a bit stronger. Pricing Renegotiation: At the same time, we have to acknowledge that our visibility into pricing renegotiation is visible at best. We haven't noticed many pressures, as various pricing points have remained stable over time. We have heard anecdotally about some discounts Fiserv had to give to its clients, but these anecdotes are not enough to establish a pattern.International Markets Small But Shielded from Deal-Making: With the international business at less than 15% of total revenue at Fiserv, we believe that the non-US market is so well shielded from deal-making that one can use it as a ""control"" group against the United States. As we noted before, there are some impressive areas of growth, namely in India (cash to card payments), financial technology growth in Brazil and Argentina, as well as e-commerce in Western Europe. If Fiserv channels more marketing dollars into these areas, we could see international business at 20%+ of total revenue by 2021-22, which should make us reconsider the multiple. At present, we are not there yet.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.1. Consolidation in the financial services industry, which has actually been prevalent over the previous decade: it could definitely hurt Fiserv's revenue by decreasing the number of clients.2. Cyber attacks can disrupt Fiserv's delivery of services since its operations depend on receiving, storing, processing, and transmitting sensitive information. Because of that, cyber attacks could create costly litigations for the company.3. A heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry, such as the Dodd-Frank account, could create financial burdens for Fiserv. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may enact further regulations that target the way FISV conducts business and force the company to enact additional controls."
4305447,105417,2019-11-11T12:37:35-05:00,"Solid quarter, but we expected much of the revenue traction, particularly around payments, which does not get us to raising the multiple.
        International markets are still small, relative to FIS, but getting better, particularly in the developing world.
        CheckFree Product Remains Fiserv's Star.","A global provider of financial services technology, Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) has more than 12K clients worldwide, which include banks, credit unions, investment management firms, billers, and retailers, among others. The company provides account processing systems, electronic bill payment and presentment services, as well as card processing services and ACH enablement. The company generates about $6 billion in annual revenue, with processing and services revenue representing about 85% of the total. We note that FISV is mostly a US company, with more than 90% of revenue domestically-generated.Our primary companies in the comps peer group are Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), which jointly yield our 2020 EV/EBITDA market multiple of ~18x. At this point, we don't see further tailwinds to justify further multiple expansion, with valuation getting somewhat rich, though we still consider FISV shares a bullish case. When we apply it to our 2020 EBITDA estimate of $2,448 MM, we get the target price of $123 (up from $122).Clover Remains Strong: FISV's cloud-based, POS Clover platform now generates $100+ billion in annual payment volume, growing at 30%+. Further, add-on Clover services, with payment device shipments are trending at 25% Y/Y. For a company that is growing in low-mid single digits, Clover is certainly a major opportunity.International Markets Small But Solid: While international business is at less than 15% of total revenue at Fiserv, there are some impressive areas of growth, namely in India (cash to card payments), financial technology growth in Brazil and Argentina, as well as e-commerce in Western Europe. If Fiserv channels more marketing dollars into these areas, we could see international business at 20%+ of total revenue by 2021-22, which should make us reconsider the multiple. At present, we are not there yet.Mobiliti and Corillian on Track for 4% Growth: Our estimates have been vacillating between 3% and 4% for these segments in 2020, but, per latest earnings results, we are now more in the 4% camp, as mobile banking and payment services remain strong nonetheless, particularly when it comes to the Mobility ASP service. Furthermore, the Architect product should continue delivering above-average growth by serving small business customers. CheckFree Product Remains Fiserv's Star: CheckFree continues to drive the Payments business, with customer usage growing 2%-2.3% on a quarter-to-quarter basis, as more and more customers are prone to conducting business online. In addition, we see that Popmoney, the person-to-person payments product, has been growing in double digits, fueled by Zelle partnership. Biller Solutions: While weaker than other segments, Biller should nonetheless contribute low-digit revenue growth to the top-line in 2020, driven by checkfree.com and nearly 25,000 walk-in payment locations around the United States. We expect the revenue growth to be stronger during the second and third quarters.Capital Return: We expect Fiserv to increase share repurchase authorization by $300 MM in the first half of 2020. Historically, FISV has been returning about 70-80% of its free cash flows back to shareholders. This should provide a further boost to FISV shares.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.1. Consolidation in the financial services industry, which has actually been prevalent over the previous decade: it could definitely hurt Fiserv's revenue by decreasing the number of clients.2. Cyber attacks can disrupt Fiserv's delivery of services since its operations depend on receiving, storing, processing, and transmitting sensitive information. Because of that, cyber attacks could create costly litigations for the company.3. A heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry, such as the Dodd-Frank account, could create financial burdens for Fiserv. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) may enact further regulations that target the way FISV conducts business and force the company to enact additional controls."

4352492,102293,2020-06-08T07:55:44-04:00,Fiserv is a leader in core banking solutions segment.The company is focused on synergies and additional growth opportunities from First Data acquisition.Investors should consider risks such as exposure of the merchant acquirer business to consumer spending and high debt.,"A financial technology company, Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), has been on a bumpy ride in 2020. The stock was punished in March 2020, along with the overall market. However, investors seem to have realized their mistake and identified the company’s long-term potential. The stock has recovered much of its losses and is now 43.88% above its 52-week low of $73.50. Despite this, Fiserv last closed at $109.55 on June 5, 5.26% down on a YTD (year-to-date) basis.Fiserv has reported healthy financial performance in the first quarter. While the company’s first-quarter revenues of $3.77 billion fell short of consensus by $104.34 million, EPS was in line with the consensus estimate. The company managed to demonstrate resilience during the difficult weeks of late March and early April. As the global economy starts to open up, we can expect Fiserv’s merchant transactions to gradually pick up. In late April and early May, the total transactions processed by the company dropped YoY by a low-double-digit percentage, a definite improvement compared to the 30% YoY decline in the last week of March. The company even sees a 20% YoY rise in preliminary sales for April. In this backdrop, I see significant upside potential in this stock in 2020.Today, Fiserv is a leading player in the core account processing business. Through its Fintech segment, the company provides technology solutions to banks and financial institutions to run their operations, which includes transaction reporting and processing customer deposit and loan accounts. The company also offers software solutions for other operational activities of the financial institutions such as risk management, digital banking, and cash management. This is a sticky business, considering that the switching costs in monetary and non-monetary terms are significantly high for the financial institutions. The business is also comparatively resilient to economic downturns, as it involves multi-year contracts. Revenues are generated from account and transaction fees and hence are mostly recurring. This is a relatively stable market, expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.61% and be worth $9.36 billion by 2025.In the first quarter, Fiserv reported almost flat internal revenue performance for the fintech segment with adjusted revenues to $718 million. The segment also reported $204 million in operating income and a 28.3% operating margin in the first quarter.In the first quarter, Fiserv added 12 new clients in its core processing business, of which five opted for the DNA real-time account processing platform.Distribution of stimulus funds and P2P payments has been the major positive for this business. The company is playing a crucial role in processing CARES Act PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) loans for small businesses. The company also saw robust growth in P2P (peer-to-peer) digital payment transactions and overall clients for payment solutions such as Zelle, TransferNow, and Popmoney. Zelle reported an almost 100% rise in transactions on a YoY basis and 14% on a sequential basis. Zelle also services 10 times more clients on a YoY basis and 44% more on a sequential basis. The company has also seen a solid uptick in demand for its RDC (remote deposit capture) payment solutions.E-commerce has also played a key role in boosting demand for the company’s digital payment services. In the first quarter, Fiserv added 36 new direct clients globally in its e-commerce business. The company processed 26% more e-commerce transactions in the U.S. and 20% across the world on a YoY basis.In the first quarter, Fiserv reported a 3% internal revenue performance for Payments and Network segment with adjusted revenues of $1.40 billion. The segment also reported an adjusted operating margin of 41.2% in the first quarter, a YoY rise of 280 basis points.Although merchant service businesses across the U.S. suffered in the first quarter, Fiserv seemed to be the less affected one in the industry. The company benefited from a favorable geographic mix, industry exposure, and client mix.The acquisition of First Data completed in 2019 has proved to be a boon for Fiserv. The deal added Clover, a cloud-based POS (point-of-sales) platform, to Fiserv’s portfolio. In spite of the pandemic, Clover has managed to report healthy double-digit YoY growth in gross payment volumes as well as the number of devices shipped in the first quarter. Further, the company also saw a healthy uptake of add-on software services such as virtual terminal and order-ahead functionality. Beyond this, the First Data acquisition has significantly expanded Fiserv’s geographic and client reach in the merchant acquirer business.Despite the ongoing economic uncertainties, Fiserv has not reduced synergy goals for its First Data acquisition. Currently, almost all of Fiserv’s Merchant Acceptance segment comprises of First Data’s acquired assets. The updated synergy estimates highlight the company’s confidence in the robust, long-term prospects for its overall merchant acquirer business. The company is already seeing significant improvement in merchant transactions since the lows of the last week of March 2020.The company now expects $600 million in revenue synergies in the next five years and around $75 million-$100 million in revenue synergies in 2020.Fiserv also expects to realize $1.2 billion in cost synergies from the First data deal.In February 2020, Fiserv closed the sale of a 60% stake in the Investment Services Business for net after-tax proceeds of $510 million. The company redeployed $500 million of the proceeds for share repurchases. In the first quarter, it repurchased 8.6 million shares for a total consideration of $885 million. The company is also reinvesting funds for higher growth in acquisitions. Fiserv is also focused on organic growth and is committed to deploying $500 million in its product offerings.The growth prospects of Fiserv’s merchant business are closely tied into the overall economic cycle. The company’s U.S. debit transactions business line has suffered especially much during the lockdown period. Fiserv’s acceptance business segment saw an abnormal decline in operating margins in the first quarter, as the merchant acquirer business was hit by an abnormal decline in volumes at the end of March especially from the previously high-growth international clients.There have been some signs of improvement in April as markets slowly reopened and governments started distributing stimulus. While a gradual uptick is expected once shelter-in-place restrictions are eased in the U.S., there still remains significant uncertainty for this business in 2020.Similar to most other companies, Fiserv anticipates a tough second quarter and gradual recovery in the second half of 2020. The company has also withdrawn its 2020 outlook.First Data acquisition has substantially increased Fiserv’s debt. At the end of the first quarter, the company carried a debt of $22 billion on its balance sheet. The debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio is 3.8x, higher than its historic level. Further, the company expects to refinance some of the $850 million bonds maturing in the second quarter. Although the company plans to reduce its debt significantly in the next 18-24 months, this nevertheless is a major risk in such uncertain times.According to FinViz, the 12-month consensus target price for Fiserv is $122.85. I believe that this share price is low considering the huge growth potential available for payment technology companies in the current global economy.The majority of analysts are optimistic about the stock. On June 1, Oppenheimer resumed coverage for the stock with Outperform rating. On May 14, Susquehanna analyst Brett Huff upgraded the company’s rating to Positive from Neutral and raised the target price from $108 to $114. On May 11, Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi reiterated Buy rating but reduced target price to $135 from $152. On May 8, RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin reiterated Outperform rating and raised the target price from $113 to $132. On May 8, Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Willi reiterated Overweight rating and raised the target price from $110 to $125.Today, Fiserv’s offerings form an integral part of current financial technology infrastructure. Hence, despite the high valuations, I believe that the stock can go up to $132 in the next 12 months. Hence, I recommend technology-focused investors with above-average risk appetite and an investment horizon of at least a year to consider adding this stock."
4297970,105417,2019-10-23T08:45:00-04:00,"Longer term, we expect the focus to shift to international markets at Fiserv, driving faster organic revenue growth and margin expansion.Outsourcing and cross-selling opportunities remain significant, with the overall ""banking"" market underpenetrated.Product development remains key longer term.","We published on Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) on October 15th, where we outlined some near-term catalysts. What differentiates this piece is a focus on some longer-term trends, which we further uncovered during our research on Fiserv's core competitor, Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY).We note that the risks to Fiserv's story (around regulation, security threats, and overall consolidation in the financial services industry remain the same), while our valuation still suggests a target price of $122, per our 2020 EV/EBITDA market multiple of ~18x. The story outlined below is a long-term scenario, which shouldn't affect our multiple at this time but, if properly executed, could definitely result in both multiple and estimate revisions.Product Development Strategy and Cross-Selling Opportunities: While FISV has demonstrated strong acquisitive tendencies over the last several years – which allowed the company to create the scale that affords it a considerable competitive advantage – management sees its primary focus shifting away from M&A toward the optimization of business, which we believe should be very helpful to both revenue growth and margin expansion in the long run. Overall, FISV is likely to continue investing in organic growth through product development and cross-selling opportunities among its two core business units, together with targeted tuck-ins. In turn, this should support meaningful share gains versus FIS and JKHY.Plenty of Room for Organic Growth: Even as the total number of U.S. banks decreases, there is a growing propensity toward outsourcing more functions to a single vendor. In 2018, for instance, 84% of new deals won by core banking software/services vendors in the U.S. were outsourcing agreements. As an example, each vendor manages the work stream for a client, earning processing fees, up from 65% in 2008. While U.S. banks still predominantly use in-house systems, there is still a growing tendency to outsource. US banks, particularly bulge-bracket players, are increasingly realizing the efficiency of outsourcing, both in terms of cost and the quality of outsourced systems.International Banks Remain Underpenetrated - We see a substantial opportunity not only in Europe, but also in Latin America and Asia, as Fiserv could mount a meaningful competition to its core competitor, FIS. Furthermore, the example of FIS shows that there is an opportunity to branch out into consulting business, like Capco. We note that both organic revenue growth and margins are much more attractive in non-US markets.Strong Core Processing Applications: When it comes to industry standards, Fiserv’s core processing software applications run critical banking processes, such as deposit systems and customer management. FISV provides a number of ancillary applications to clients, such as trust and investment account management, as well as regulatory reporting. Other services include branch automation, back office support systems, and compliance support. We believe that this “package” of processing solutions stands at the core of the company’s mid-single-digit revenue growth.Broad Longer-Term Strategy: Fiserv’s longer-term strategy is focused on preserving and broadening its presence among U.S. and international financial institutions of all sizes; adding applications it can cross-sell to existing markets; maintaining and strengthening its market leadership through a transformative approach to client operations; and driving ongoing margin expansion. The company sees a major shift toward “optimization” of the business in 2020-22. Overall, we expect FISV to continue investing in organic growth through product development, channeling ~3.0%-3.5% of revenue toward capital expenditures."

The stock is trading at a premium it deserves for its profitability and defensiveness but not for its upside potential. We see the post-merger integration opportunities as larger than what the valuation gives credit for. We think that shares will perform very well post-investor days and earnings calls during which we expect the Management to provide details on the cost-saving efforts.Fiserv is a leading provider of financial services technology to the finance industry. The Company is one of the largest issuer processors out there. Most of Fiserv's revenue comes from critical tasks for the execution of payment processing and thus its customers' business. This makes the Company's revenues very defensive. Being defensive is a very beneficial characteristic in this market environment as we're in the longest running bull market ever.Along with its defensive characteristics, the category is defined by profitability. The sector median has 45% gross, 12% EBITDA, 4% net, and 6% free cash flow margins. We'd be happy to be buying a defensive company with these characteristics given the right price and an upside catalyst.Fiserv manages to blow past its sector though. The Company reports 47% gross, 32% EBITDA, 16% net, and 19% free cash flow margins. Fiserv crushes the sector median in ROE as well with 36% vs. 7%.The attractiveness of the margin profile is reflected in the valuation. Fiserv's TTM multiples vs. those of its sector's median are 32x vs. 21x non-GAAP P/E, 40x vs. 14x EV/EBITDA, and 47x vs. 19x P/CF. We think that this premium reflects the solid profitability and the defensiveness of the business.Usually we would say that the company was at fair valuation and would only consider it as a defensive holding or we'd walk away. But this is a different case as we see upside as detailed below.Recently, Fiserv announced that it will be buying First Data Corporation (FDC) to create a payments giant. We are very bullish on this deal. We think that the guidance provided by the Management is conservative, and sets things up nicely for the future.The two companies will have significant cost synergies. We expect two rounds of efficiency measures. Lower overhead and SG&A will come first as it is relatively straightforward to do. The two company heads are probably already planning the process. Next will come the working synergies arising from merging of actual operations. These will involve revamp of sales units, consolidation/optimization of data centers and optimizing technology. We expect this to take longer as it is a much more sophisticated process. The Management guided for $900 mn in cost synergies.The combined entity will have faster top line growth than the sum of the parts. For Fiserv shareholders, we note that the new entity will grow faster just because of First Data's faster-growing revenues before any synergy kicks in. We see additional revenue opportunities from wider-reaching sales network, a greater services offering, and from cross-selling opportunities. The Management guided for $500 mn in revenue synergies.We expect the top and bottom line gains to have a magnified effect on the price as they will garner a higher valuation multiple. The combined effect of $1.4 bn on the bottom line is enough to pile investors on the name. We remind what we wrote at the top, this guidance is likely conservative.We recommend buying Fiserv on its defensive characteristics, strong margin profile, and post-merger integration opportunities. We see alpha around investor days and earnings calls where we expect the Management to provide updates on the cost-saving efforts."
4293438,25781,2019-09-25T09:39:22-04:00,"Fiserv has recently acquired First Data making it one of the largest fintech companies in the U.S.This acquisition should lead to higher growth prospects than on a stand-alone basis, while synergies can provide further upside if the integration goes well.Fiserv trades at some discount to peers, which doesn’t seem to be justified.","Fiserv (FISV) is an interesting fintech company and its recent acquisition of First Data (FDC) gives it higher upside potential if the integration is well executed. Its valuation can appear high in absolute terms, but compared to its closest peers it trades at a discount. Its share price still seems to have upside, despite the impressive run in recent years.Fiserv provides integrated information management and electronic commerce systems and services to the financial industry.Its solutions include transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, beyond others. It was founded in 1984 and nowadays serves clients in more than 100 countries. It has a market capitalization of about $71 billion and trades on the NASDAQ.Fiserv’s core business is to provide financial companies with the technology services they need to operate, such as core processing systems, electronic billing and payment systems. It operates in a highly competitive industry. Its main competitors include Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) or ACI Worldwide (ACIW).Fiserv serves customers of all sizes, but its competitive advantage has been with small to midsized banks without in-house processing units. It serves about 12,000 clients worldwide, but some 95% of its revenue is generated in the U.S. The company’s business is spread across different services, but processing and services revenue is the major source given that it represented about 85% of the company’s total revenue in the last year.These services are primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that have terms between 3 and 5 years, generally with high renewal rates. This means that the vast majority of Fiserv’s business has a relatively good visibility regarding revenues in the medium-term, giving it a relatively defensive business profile.Fiserv has a very good growth history, both organically as more financial transactions are moving online and through acquisitions. Fiserv has targeted businesses that complements its own, enabling it to provide a wide range of integrated products and services to customers. Its annual revenues have increased each year since 2010, with 2009 the only year with lower revenues compared to the previous one due to the global financial crisis.Profitability also has improved over the past decade as the company got larger and more efficient, reflected in its EBITDA margin that increased from levels of about 32% in 2009 to a new record high of near 38% in 2018. Going forward, Fiserv is expected to pursue growth opportunities both from developing existing services and potential acquisitions that are complementary to its business profile.Additionally, new-client wins and sales of additional services to existing processing clients should support organic revenue growth, as customers of banks are increasingly adopting peer-to-peer payments and digital banking, which is good for fintech companies like Fiserv.Regarding its financial performance, Fiserv has an impressive track record delivering top and bottom-line growth and generating significant cash flow over the past few years.In 2018, Fiserv’s revenues amounted to $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.2% from the previous year. Its operating income was $1.8 billion, while net income decreased a little to $1.2 billion due to disposals.The company’s cash flow generation remained strong with net cash from operating activities of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion. This means that Fiserv’s free cash flow generation is very good, given that it has been above 100% in the past two years due to its tech-oriented business with low need of fixed assets.Source: Fiserv.During the first six months of 2019, Fiserv maintained a very good operating performance with adjusted revenue up by 6% year-on-year to around $2.9 billion and adjusted EPS up by 11% yoy, to $1.66 per share. On the other hand, its adjusted operating margin declined by some 40 basis points (bps) and Fiserv’s free cash flow conversion was below 100%, due to a decline in profitability at its Payments unit during the first quarter of 2019.For the rest of the year, Fiserv’s target is to reach 4.5-5% organic revenue growth in 2019 and adjusted EPS growth of 10-14%. Operating margins are expected to increase by more than 50 bps, while free cash flow conversion should remain above 100% for the full year. Investors should note that these targets do not include any impact of its recent acquisition of First Data.Regarding the shareholder remuneration policy, as a growth company, Fiserv doesn’t distribute dividends to shareholders preferring instead to perform share buybacks as a capital return policy. In 2018, Fiserv purchased $1.91 billion of its common stock, which represented about 6% of its average market capitalization during the year.Due to the acquisition of First Data, Fiserv’s share buyback program is on hold and the company is not expected to resume share repurchases until it deleverages its balance sheet, which may take two years to accomplish.Fiserv agreed back in January to buy First Data, an electronic payments processor, for about $22 billion in an all-stock transaction. This is one of the largest mergers in the financial industry in the past few months, creating one of the leading companies in the payments industry.The merger was recently closed and Fiserv shareholders own about 57.5% of the new combined company, while First Data shareholders owning 42.5%.Even though Fiserv has made several acquisitions throughout its history with a good track record, this deal is its largest and most complex so far. This means that integration risk is high and will change Fiserv’s business, with a significant exposure to the intensely competitive market of merchant-payments processing at about 38% of combined revenue.Source: Fiserv.Fiserv believes that this business combination makes sense from the complementary assets between the two companies, projecting higher revenue growth than it would achieve on its own and costs savings of about $900 million over five years.Indeed, the focus of Fiserv will be in the accelerating the combined merchant business, an area where Fiserv was not very strong compared to some peers. There may exist significant revenue to capture by distributing First Data’s merchant-payment services through the thousands of smaller banks that use Fiserv services currently.It also expected to maintain First Data’s partnership with Bank of America (BAC), an important client in the past for First Data, but Fiserv and BAC recently announced that they will pursue independent merchant service strategies in June 2020, when the joint-venture contract expires. This is a negative development for the combined company, but the merger rationale remains valid in my opinion.Additionally, Fiserv will continue to serve customers of this joint-venture to its proportionate ownership stake (First Data had 51% of the joint-venture) at current pricing for 3 years. This means that only after that existing contracts may be renewed at lower rates, which should have some negative impact on organic revenue growth thereafter. Nevertheless, Fiserv expects the termination of this joint-venture to be rather neutral to its earnings and free cash flow in the medium-term, an expectation that was well received by the market.Moreover, even including this setback for Fiserv, it still expects at least 20% adjusted EPS accretion in the first year and more than 40% when First Data is fully integrated, showing the strong business and financial merits of this merger.Regarding the capital structure, the First Data deal led to higher balance sheet leverage, but Fiserv intends to deleverage to levels more in-line with its previous capital structure within 24 months. Given that annual free cash flow is expected to be about $3.6 billion, this seems a reasonable target for a relatively short period of time.Source: Fiserv.Taking this into account, Fiserv is not expected to pursue large acquisitions in the next few years, at least until it achieves the targeted synergies and leverage metrics, while it may make smaller acquisitions that complement its business, in-line with its long-term strategy.Regarding Fiserv’s financial numbers going forward, according to analysts’ estimates, its revenues should be about $16.2 billion in 2020 (the first full year including First Data), EBITDA is expected to be close to $6 billion or an EBITDA margin of 37%, while net profit should come close to $2.7 billion and EPS is estimated at $3.67.Taking these numbers into account, Fiserv is currently trading at close to 29x forward earnings and 15.3x EV/EBITDA. At first glance, these multiples may appear expensive, but compared to its closest peers, Fiserv’s valuation seems reasonable and may have some upside given that competitors currently trade above 30x earnings and EV/EBITDA close to 20x.This means that if Fiserv executes well the integration of First Data and reaches its synergies targets, its current valuation is more than justified and has some upside potential if the market continues to pay high multiples to growth companies like Fiserv.However, if the global economy continues to slow down and equity markets correct, valuations for fintech companies should probably suffer and Fiserv may be more affected than peers, given that its business growth is weaker than some other players in the fintech space, like Visa or PayPal.Fiserv has an interesting position within the fintech industry and its recent acquisition of First Data makes its business more balanced and with stronger growth prospects in the long-term. Despite these strong fundamentals, Fiserv trades at a discount to its closest peers which doesn’t seem to be justified.Therefore, a re-rating is likely in the medium-term, making Fiserv an interesting growth play right now based on valuation and further upside if the integration of First Data leads to higher synergies than expected."
4347268,105306,2020-05-13T15:41:48-04:00,"After a strong start of the year, total revenue finished the quarter down 1%, as social restrictions caused a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions in late March.As long as we have a gradual recovery in activity in the coming quarters, I believe Fiserv can reclaim the growth path across its business lines.I expect an upside of 15% to 19% to shares of Fiserv, which is the gap between P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples of Fiserv and the average of the peer group.","Fiserv (FISV) ended the first quarter in a muted tone, with a slight miss in revenue and EPS in line with estimations, eclipsing strong growth in several fronts during the quarter. Showing business strength in merchant, payment and financial verticals and with costs synergies underway, the company is looking to achieve double-digit earnings growth for the full year. Underscored by this upbeat outlook, I see Fiserv well positioned to growth in a potential scenario of modest recovery in the coming quarters.With a strong start of the year until Mid-March, total revenue finished the quarter at $3.77 billion, down 1% over a year ago and falling short of expectations by 2.5%, as shelter-in-place orders and other restrictions caused a significant decrease in payments volume and transactions during the last two weeks of March.In spite of that, internal revenue grew 4% to the prior year, despite tough comparisons with Q1 2019. As a remark, internal revenue excludes foreign currencies fluctuations, divestitures and acquisitions (except First Data, which is presented on a combined company basis).As expected, Merchant Acceptance was the most affected segment in the end of March, as revenue segment is particularly linked to transaction volumes. Even tough, segment internal revenue saw a growth of 6% from a year before.The Payment segment delivered internal revenue growth of 3% in the quarter, driven by card services and output solutions. P2P transactions, including Popmoney and Zelle, that have nearly doubled over a year ago and increased 14% sequentially, as clients using Zelle grew 44% compared to Q4 2019. The segment was also heavily affected in the end of March. As an example of the magnitude of this disruption, debt transactions saw double-digit decline during the period, despite still finishing the quarter up mid-single-digits.Finally, the FinTech segment was relatively stable in the period, with internal revenue growing 1%, with gains in high quality recurring revenue and increased interest in digital solutions, such as Mobiliti and Architect.In aggregate, adjusted operating income increased 1% and adjusted operating margin grew 10 bps to 27.8%, missing previous expectations, driven by declines in revenue in the last two weeks of March, despite nearly $90 million expenses synergies. As a result, adjusted EPS was $0.99, up from $0.85 a year ago and in line with estimations.Going throughout the second quarter, Fiserv saw first signs of improvement in late April and May, as transactions volume was still down by low-double-digits, but bouncing back from a roughly 30% decline in the last week of March.This upswing underscores the company's forecasts of a gradual improvement throughout the remainder of the year. However, in the short term, the management team still expects a meaningful pressure on the second quarter's financial results.While top line growth will be challenged in 2020, the company expects that ongoing synergies will help mitigate this unfavorable scenario. On top of that, five-year synergy targets were significantly increased in March so that revenue synergies were increased by $100 million to $600 million, with an amount of $75 million to $100 million planned in 2020. Furthermore, cost synergies were increased by $300 million to $1.2 billion, with 47% of this amount already actioned in Q1 2020.In light of synergies potential and the resilience of the majority of Fiserv's business, the company expects to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2020. While this is a not a formal commitment, as the outlook for 2020 has been withdrawn for the time being due to current uncertainties, the management team sees the company on the right path to achieve this mark.As pointed out during the earnings call, this can very well be the case, provided two basic assumptions materialize. The first one is that April and Q2 will show the lowest transaction volumes of the year, followed by a measured recovery, and the second one is that there will be no a second significant wave of social distancing and shelter-in-place orders going forward.In order to have a better perspective of Fiserv's financial and valuation metrics on a relative basis, let's compare the company with peers like Fidelity National Information Services, FLEETCOR Technologies, Global Payments and Jack Henry & Associates.Starting with the profitability, we can see that Fiserv's gross profit margin is in the middle of the peer group and shows the highest growth rate. The analysis of the operating income margin, however, indicates that Fiserv is lagging the peer group, being only above Fidelity, and the technology sector as well.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorMoving to the valuation analysis, Fiserv trades at lower P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples compared to the peer group (P/E: FISV 22.84 x Peers 28.28 and EV/EBITDA: FISV 16.71 x Peers 19.65), while Fiserv's EV/Revenue multiple is slightly higher than the peer group. On the flip side, looking at the long-term annual earnings growth rate, we see Fiserv and Global Payments with top projections by analysts, indicating that both companies are expected to be trading at higher valuation multiples. Nevertheless, while Global Payments is indeed trading at higher multiples, Fiserv trades at lower multiples, as showed before. Therefore, I consider it is reasonable to expect an upside of 15% to 19% to shares of Fiserv, which is the gap between P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples of Fiserv and the average of the peer group.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorPart of this valuation multiples gap though can be explained by the underperformance of shares of Fiserv over the last 3 months, which have lagged the average of the peer group and also the broader technology sector.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorDespite this underperformance, shares of Fiserv have recovered nicely together with the broader market. Meanwhile, from a price momentum perspective, I think that the stock still has room to extend the move upwards, as 20-day moving average (red line) remains in a uptrend and above the 50-day moving average (blue line), the stock price is above both moving averages and RSI is also in a uptrend. Meanwhile, it will be important to watch if RSI does not show any divergence with the price action. In case it happens, I would recommend waiting a leg down before entering a new position.Source: Seeking AlphaAs long as we have a gradual recovery in activity in the coming quarters, I believe Fiserv can reclaim the growth path across its business lines before social restrictions enacted in March. Meanwhile, adding to my upbeat view on the company, ongoing revenue and costs synergies are expected to bring a meaningful contribution to earnings growth in 2020, which can be a catalyst for stock prices appreciation, at least on a relative basis, and narrows current valuation gap compared to the peer group."
4234440,25120,2019-01-20T12:09:12-05:00,"Fiserv is acquiring First Data Corp., in what is actually a mega merger.The deal creates a giant in the wider payment space as the rationale behind the deal is driven by optimistic synergy targets.Despite uncertainty about the synergies, projected accretion to earnings is quite large, yet I have some questions regarding the synergies and pro-forma numbers, warranting some caution.","Fiserv (FISV) is a payment provider which is not that well known to the general public. The announcement of a mega deal warrants an update on the company and the combination being created in the very large deal which the business made with First Data Corp. (FDC).Investors initially acted reserved to the deal, but the promise of large synergies make the deal worthwhile, although quite some confusion has arisen (in my eyes) with regards to those synergies. Given the full pro-forma valuation, >3 times leverages ratio, I am happy to pass on this current opportunity, looking for more guidance later this year.Fiserv and First Data Corp. have reached an agreement under which the former will acquire First Data in an all-stock deal. Following the terms of the deal, investors in First Data will be given 0.303 shares of Fiserv for every share which they currently own, implying an equity valuation of $22 billion.The $22.74 per share deal valuation marks a 29% premium for the shares of Fiserv and results in its shareholders combined owning 42.5% of the shares of the pro-forma business.The rationale is that of combining complementary businesses, greater market power and synergies. With the deal, both firms combine key functions, including account processing, digital banking solutions, card issuer processing, network services, integrated payments and points-of-sale-solution, among others.Both the strategic benefits and financial considerations are key in this deal. Enhanced revenue potential is pegged at $500 million or more, but that is over a 5-year period following the deal announcement, implying little over a hundred million in additional revenues per year. The real kicker are the projected cost synergies of $900 million over a 5-year period, of course with higher synergies seen towards the end of this time range. In the deal presentation, it seems that these synergies are to be realised on an annual run rate, as cost synergies are seen on a per annum basis as well. Of course, the difference, whether these are cumulative on a five-year period or annual period, are key.Management did say that Fiserv's earnings in the first year are seen up 20% (adjusted earnings). Following realisation of synergies, adjusted earnings are seen up by 40% once the full cost synergy run rate is being achieved.The interesting part about this deal is that Fiserv is the smaller player of the two with $5.5 billion in revenues, although adjusted operating profits of $1.8 billion are very large, for margins equal to 33% of sales. First Data generates $8.6 billion in sales on which it reports adjusted operating profits of $2.4 billion, for margins of 28%.Including the half a billion run rate in synergies, sales could rise to $14.6 billion as adjusted operating profits could jump to $5.3 billion. The $1.1 billion gain in pro-forma adjusted operating earnings is driven by $900 million in cost synergies, and half a billion in incremental revenues with incremental margins around 40%.So what about the valuation and the pro-forma numbers? Fiserv ended 2018 with 405 million shares outstanding which at an unaffected price of $75 works down to a $30.4 billion equity valuation. Including a $4.6 billion net debt load, the enterprise valuation comes in at $35.0 billion. For the year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 billion, or $3.10-$3.11 per share, with GAAP earnings seen around $2.87-$2.88 per share.First Data reported a share count of 965 million shares at the end of Q3 which are valued at $22.74, for indeed a $22.0 billion equity component, yet this excludes a $17.2 billion net debt component. That combined adds up to a $39 billion enterprise value, slightly larger than Fiserv's $35 billion enterprise valuation of course.Knowing that Fiserv reports earnings around $3 per share, or $1.2 billion in actual dollar terms, and Fiserv's $1.40 per share earnings contribution, at nearly $1.4 billion, total earnings are seen at $2.6 billion. With First Data shareholders getting a total of 292 million shares, the combined share count comes in at 700 million.Thus, pro-forma earnings are seen at at $3.70 per share, for the simple fact that First Data trades at a lower multiple, although earnings reported by First Data are very adjusted earnings. After adjusting for $250 million in annualised stock-based compensation in the case of First Data, that reduces earnings by $0.35 per share, for a pro-forma number of $3.35 per share. Even after making this adjustment, there is instant accretion to earnings. The $3.70 per share calculation for adjusted earnings confirms the 20% accretion predicted by the firm in the deal presentation.The company furthermore indicated 40% accretion once revenue and costs synergies are fully accounted for, on top of the 20% immediate accretion. 20% accretion works down to roughly $0.60 per share, or $420 million in actual dollar terms after accounting for taxes of course. Including taxes, that suggests that synergies should add roughly $550 million to the operating earnings line once the full benefits of the deal are seen, while annual revenues are pegged at $1.1 billion.Let's simply assume that the guidance is right and earnings are at least seen at $4.20 per share once the full benefits work out. That suggests that at $78, shares now trade at 22 times the adjusted $3.60 per share earnings number seen on a pro-forma basis, and at 19 times earnings once the full synergies are seen.The combined $22 billion net debt load is sizeable with pro-forma operating income seen at $5.3 billion. If we include half a billion run rate in D&A charges from Fiserv and a billion in D&A at First Data, it is clear that EBITDA numbers run at $6-7 billion (as some amortisation charges are already adjusted for in the adjusted operating income number). At the midpoint, this suggests a roughly 3.5 times leverage ratio, manageable given the organic growth and predictability of the business.The actual dollar premium for shares of First Data comes in around $5 per share, or about $5 billion. That number looks high, but synergies are quite high as well, although confusion remains based on the communication of how high these synergies actually are. Shares of Fiserv initially fell about $2.5 in response to the news, for a $1.5-$2.0 billion reduction in the value (including to be issued shares), but a favourable market and optimism about the deal allowed the shares to quickly recoup the losses, and some more.If the company is really delivering on $1.1 billion in combined revenue and cost synergies per year, that is quite substantial, at roughly $1.60 on the bottom line. After all, the 40% expected earnings guidance, with half of accretion driven by buying a business at a lower multiple, suggests that synergies alone add to just $0.60 per share.I am not a big fan of the business of First Data, but there are opportunities to make it run better, although it could weigh on Fiserv as well in case integration does not work out. Trading at a market multiple based on adjusted earnings (once all synergies are achieved) and given the higher leverage ratio, I find it easy to pass on Fiserv for now, but will watch further comments made by management through the course of this year with great interest."
4249526,101421,2019-03-18T14:14:43-04:00,First Data has agreed to acquire Software Express for an undisclosed amount.Software Express provides a range of payments processing services to merchants in Brazil.FDC is seeking to increase its footprint in the growing but highly competitive payments market in Brazil.,"First Data (FDC) announced it has agreed to acquire Software Express for an undisclosed amount.Software Express operates as an electronic funds transfer [EFT] solutions provider in Brazil.With the deal, FDC seeks to increase its footprint in a growing Brazilian market, but capable competitors abound in the market and the combination will need to prove its marketing and operations efficiencies if it is to succeed.Sao Paulo, Brazil-based Software Express was founded in 1986 to provide EFT solutions to Brazilian businesses. The company serves over 100,000 merchants and has processed more than 12 billion transactions in 2018. Management is headed by CEO Henrique Ribeiro Filho.Software Express’ primary offerings include:Source: Software ExpressAccording to a market research report by Report Linker, the Brazilian e-commerce sector was valued at $7.4 billion in 2012, had grown to $16.1 billion in 2016, and is projected to reach $23.1 billion by 2020.This represents an extremely high CAGR of 21.4% between 2012 and 2016.The main drivers for this expected growth are government incentives such as reduced fees and interest rates on credit card transactions, the adoption of alternative payment methods as well as the emergence of fintech companies.Major competitive vendors that provide payments solutions in Brazil include:Source: SentieoFDC didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of December 31, 2018, FDC had $555 million in cash and equivalents and $31.3 billion in total liabilities, of which settlement obligations represented $11.4 billion and long-term debt accounted for $16.4 billion.Free cash flow during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was $2 billion.FDC is acquiring Software Express to expand its operations in the growing and lucrative Brazilian payments sector.As Gustavo Marin, EVP of First Data in Latin America, stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, FDC’s stock price has risen 58.5% vs. Global Payments’ (GPN) rise of 17.8%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoEarnings surprises in the past 12 quarters have been mostly positive, although the firm’s Q3 negative surprise was a standout:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst ratings are largely centered on a ‘Hold’ rating and the consensus price target of $26.09 implies only a 3.4% upside from the stock’s current price of $25.22 at press time: Source: Seeking AlphaFirst Data is busy on the acquisition front, with its own acquisition by Fiserv (FISV) announced in January apparently not hindering its movement to grow through more dealmaking.Additionally, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) just announced a massive deal to acquire Worldpay (WP) in a $35-billion merger to gain additional scale in the payment space.So, the deal for Software Express is relatively small in that context but important for the firm to continue growing its Brazilian footprint.Brazil represents an enticing opportunity as its economy appears poised to rebound after several years of recession and retrenchment.The country has high entrepreneurship and mobile penetration rates, providing payment processors with a fertile environment for growth opportunities.Also, the recent election of a ‘pro-business’ government focused on reducing the overweening state apparatus and letting business operate in more free markets has added a positive spin to the perception of the operating environment there.The important aspects of the deal will be for FDC to gain efficiencies as it grows bigger in Brazil. Competition is stiff and provides merchants and users with numerous payment options. So the combination of the two companies will have to produce more than top-line revenue growth - it will need to produce increased customer acquisition efficiencies for the deal to pay off.Investors in FDC won’t know if the acquisition is a good one for several quarters, and even then, the numbers may be small as FDC gets swallowed by Fiserv."
4234545,22717,2019-01-21T14:26:01-05:00,"The merger arbitrage play of the all-stock merger announced Jan. 17, 2019, between Fiserv, Inc. and First Data Corp. is not very profitable on a risk-adjusted basis.Assuming it takes 10 months for closing, merger arbitrage play would only yield 3.41% on an annualized basis by buying First Data now.Including risk probabilities, the expected return is 0.63% annually if one were to buy FDC now, assuming a 10-month close. This is a subpar return.","The all-stock merger announced on Jan. 17, 2019, between Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) and First Data Corp. (FDC) is not a good arbitrage play, at least at this point.Every shareholder of FDC will receive exactly 0.303 shares of FISV when the deal closes. That is the exchange ratio.So we can calculate the expected return if one were to buy the shares of FDC now (as of the close of Friday Jan. 18, 2019) and hope to receive a reasonable profit when the shares of FISV are later received upon the closing of the merger.Source: Hake estimatesIn other words, FISV shares received today are worth only $0.65 per share more than the existing price of FDC. That represents a gain of 2.83%, assuming you could instantly close the arbitrage.The table shows various annualized return scenarios. For example, if the deal closes in three months, the annualized compound return of 2.83% (compounded 4 times during a 12-month forward period) represents an annualized return of 11.82%. Of course, that assumes you could replicate the same deal 4 times over the 12 months.But the deal is not going to close in three months. It probably won't even close in six months, when the potential annualized return is 5.74%. In fact, the merger documents discuss a termination date of October 6, 2019, as being the first of several worst possible termination closing date cases. The table above shows that the expected return, if the deal closes by Oct 6 or roughly 10 months from now, is only 3.41% on an annualized basis.It is important to take into account what could happen if the deal does not close. For one, FDC is likely to fall. Let's make some simple assumptions:What if there is a 33% chance the deal won't close, and if that happens, the stock price falls 5%? We can put together a risk arbitrage expected return analysis as follows:Source: Hake estimatesIn other words, the loss from a one-third probability of the deal not closing would be -1.65%, but the gain would be 2.28%, and the total expected return summing these two, as a weighted average return, is only 0.63%. This assumes it takes 10 months for the deal to close and that FDC only drops 5% if the deal does not close.If the deal takes only six months to close (instead of 10 months), the expected return is slightly higher. The annualized risk-adjusted return would be 2.20%:Source: Hake estimatesIn fact, if we vary the probabilities of the deal not closing, we can estimate the break-even risk probability over six months:Source: Hake estimatesThis table above shows that, for example using the first row, if there is only a 5% risk of not closing in six months, the expected annualized return is 5.21% over six months. The last row shows that if there is just greater than 50% of the deal not closing in six months, the expected return is about break-even.However, the numbers assuming a closing by the end of 10 months are worse:Source: Hake estimatesThis table shows that the break-even risk is 40% (not 50% in the case of six months) of the deal not closing. Keep in mind that the expected return only assumes a 5% drop in the stock price of FDC, if the deal does not close.What if there is a 10% drop in the FDC stock price (not a 5% drop as assumed above) if the deal does not close by the end of a 10-month period? What is the expected return?The table below shows the expected return, and break-even risk is too low:Source: HakeThis table shows that there can only be a 25% chance of the deal not closing before break-even is reached (assuming a 10% decline in the price of FDC). If that happens, any risk higher than 25% of the deal not closing over 10 months would result in an unprofitable merger arbitrage play.Both companies seem very motivated to close the deal. KKR owns 86% of FDC and will likely push to have the deal close before the end of 10 months. There is a potential $665 million termination fee payable to FDC if the deal does not close (FISV would have to pay), although there are a number of ""out"" conditions. In addition, there are a number of extensions possible past the first termination date of Oct. 6, 2019. The deal can be extended so that the breakup fee does not have to be paid, up until April 2020.The key issue seems to be whether the regulators will block the deal. There is no way to clearly judge whether that is the case at this point. However, the risk seems to be much higher than 25%, as implied by our break-even analysis above.In summary, the potential returns are simply subpar. Why should anyone risk capital buying FDC now for six months just to earn 2.83% on an absolute basis (i.e. not including any risk analysis and not including the annualized return method). Even if the deal only takes six months to close, the annualized return is only 5.74%. In addition, taking into account various downside risks, the expected risk-adjusted return is very low, just 2.20% on an annualized basis.I would argue that the investor should wait until there is more clarity. The expected return should be at least 20% on a risk-adjusted basis before any capital is risked buying FDC now as a merger arbitrage play."
4289766,104183,2019-09-05T04:40:31-04:00,"Fiserv, following its acquisition of First Data, is a leading fintech company that has posted incredible shareholder returns over the long term.Growth looks set to continue for the top and bottom line, albeit at a modest rate.The valuation is high, but not unreasonable for a company in this space, and there’s more room to run.The recent joint venture termination with Bank of America Merchant Services has worked out to have a neutral impact.","With buzzwords like “fintech” and “payments” in the company’s profile, this stock has been a gift to investors for years now. Fiserv (FISV) is a leading fintech company that processes payments for numerous businesses across a wide variety of sectors and seems to be completely ignorant of broader market risks, creating a real opportunity for investors. The company has just completed a major acquisition and with First Data now being integrated into the company, adjusted earnings growth will continue to be in the low double-digit range, justifying the current valuation. There is a broad slate of revenue opportunities for this firm and with a high level of free cash flow conversion, it’s difficult to see how this company falters in the quarters ahead.Source: FiservFiserv provides a wide variety of services – everything from transaction and bill processing to account transfers to P2P transfers to mobile banking services. Partnerships continue to increase and as the market grows for fintech, so does Fiserv. The most important development is that back in January, the company announced its intention to acquire First Data and subsequently closed on the deal on July 29th. The deal was valued at $22 billion in an all-stock transaction in which First Data shareholders received 0.303 Fiserv shares for each share of First Data that they owned. Large-scale acquisitions aren’t easy to pull off nor are the targets simple to integrate, but the acquisition gives the company significantly more scale and processing power.Despite this optimism, not all that glitters is gold and First Data recently announced that its joint venture with Bank of America (BAC), called Bank of America Merchant Services, will terminate in June 2020. The headlines upon first announcement of this seemed to be a stark negative, but the truth was in the details. First Data is the majority owner of this joint venture at 51% and what will follow is a proportional separation of clients and revenue, such that the two companies can continue to pursue the same operations and limit disruption to earnings. First Data will still provide clients of the total JV their current processing services until June 2023.As a result, the company has been able to create a silver lining. What really impresses me is that despite the end of this JV, Fiserv still expects First Data to be important to new Bank of America merchants following the termination and that this announcement is actually neutral or accretive on an adjusted EPS basis 3-5 years out. There may be short and medium-term costs prior to this, which investors need to watch out for indications of such an occurrence.The stock took the “neutral to accretive” outcome positively and has continued to move higher, despite the headlines suggesting that the termination might be bad for business. There will be a new processing agreement for new Bank of America clients post-June 2020, which does appease fears that the termination of the JV could be a large hit to earnings. The one item I’ll point to is that the company expects Bank of America pricing on the post-2020 clients to be “at a lower level,” which does negatively impact revenue growth. Synergy expectations from the First Data transaction are unchanged as a result of this termination, which I find to be the real positive. Integrating First Data and providing a suite of value-add offerings to clients is going to be the challenge that Fiserv faces, but I don’t believe they would’ve taken on such a sizable acquisition without the confidence to do so.Source: Investor PresentationIn looking at Q2 earnings, top line growth, on an adjusted basis, is up +7% and non-adjusted is +4%. On a YTD basis, adjusted revenue is up +6%, with non-adjusted revenue +4%. I think with this as the backdrop, it’s important to look at forward guidance. The company expects internal revenue growth of +4.5-5% (adjusted being higher, but undisclosed) and adjusted EPS growth of +10-14%. While the revenue growth rates aren’t as high as what some might synonymize fintech with, the earnings growth can satisfy valuation concerns and continue to generate capital gains for shareholders, especially since the company is expecting a modest increase in the adjusted operating margin (which helps EBITDA). Investors should recognize that these earnings figures are net of First Data results, as the acquisition closed just a few days after Q2 earnings.Source: Investor PresentationMy only issue is that on a non-adjusted basis, earnings growth has stalled. From 2017 to 2018, earnings improved only by $0.01 on a continuing basis (on a total basis, which includes discontinued operations, earnings were actually down $0.02 YOY). We’ve seen a similar trend in Q2, which is disappointing, but Q1 earnings were nearly cut in half on a YOY basis, which is rather alarming. The problem is that investors can’t look at the GAAP EPS that the company reports and, rather, needs to look at adjusted EPS, as this adds back one-time items and items that aren’t representative of the normal operations of the company. In that regard, adjusted EPS in Q2 showed an improvement of +9% YOY. Adjusted earnings on a YTD basis are up +11%.Source: Investor PresentationThe stock is up +44% on a YTD basis and now boasts a market cap of nearly $72 billion. That’s significantly outpacing the market, especially considering there have been no major dips. The stock has tripled in the last five years and if you’re an investor sitting on the sidelines wondering if you missed the run, recognize that this stock has more to give.If investors are looking at the non-adjusted earnings figures, the valuation for FISV is high. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that because with a 43x P/E, it’s not exactly that cheap. If someone wants to disagree with that notion, by all means do, but a 40x+ P/E has never been cheap by most investing standards. Now, as I’ve previously stated, adjusted EPS is the necessary figure to look at rather than GAAP EPS. On this basis, the company is expecting $3.39-$3.52 on the full year 2019.This would equate to a forward earnings multiple of 30.7x. While this is substantially better than 43x forward earnings, it still looks expensive, especially for a company that’s only growing the top line at a mid single-digit rate. However, investors can easily argue that valuations for a basket of companies in the broader market are already expensive and to have an investment linked to the fintech market is worth paying 30x for.Source: StockChartsThe stock also doesn’t pay a dividend, despite being now a $72 billion company. There may come a day when this starts to be an expectation of investors, especially in light of free cash flow developments. The company has an impressively high free cash flow conversion percentage and it’s only increasing. While the operating margin is roughly flat on a YOY basis, free cash flow conversion has improved from 78% to 91% currently. That’s incredible.Free cash flow expected for the full year 2019 is $759 million. There’s a chance this is a low estimate from the Street currently, considering the materially higher free cash flow conversion rate YOY and the fact that 2018 free cash flow was $1.19 billion. Considering that the company is targeting a >105% free cash flow conversion rate (likely due to working capital efficiencies), there is the potential for a run rate $1 billion in free cash flow after 2019.With $1 billion in free cash flow, paying a dividend to shareholders is a reality, but not necessarily worthwhile. For simplification, if the company was to pay the entirety of free cash flow to shareholders in an annual dividend, the yield would be rather insignificant at 1.3%. This wouldn’t compete with the broader market, but would certainly hold weight in the fintech space, where most companies lack a dividend (or even profitability). In my opinion, the free cash flow right now is better spent on pursuing more growth opportunities such that when the market moderates over the long term, the company’s improved profitability can allow for a competitive dividend.Leverage also needs to be a consideration, as the company has $13.7 billion in long-term debt; however, the company also has a significant cash balance at $8.4 billion, making net debt $5.3 billion. The company doesn’t report an adjusted EBITDA figure, so ordinary EBITDA for the company is approximately $5.64 billion in EBITDA. That means the company has leverage of just under 1x, which gives them the capacity to go out and pursue more growth investments, like the one made with First Data. We have to give the company credit for being smart with its financing options as they obtained a $22 billion company without burdening their balance sheet. To provide another valuation point, on an EV/EBITDA basis, the company trades at 15.6x. I expect this to improve as the company’s operating margin improves as a result of synergies.Fiserv is going to grow core revenue in the mid-single digits but adjusted EPS at a double-digit pace and this can continue for several years given the rapidly increasing market size for fintech and the increased need for processing and account solutions. That’s a very difficult runway to bet against, especially when the company has a high free cash flow conversion rate and a clean balance sheet. Despite the stock’s impressive run in the last five years, there’s arguably still more to come, despite the optically high valuation."
4251422,101421,2019-03-27T18:00:47-04:00,First Data has acquired ayCash for an undisclosed sum.ayCash provides a range of payment processing services to German merchants.FDC is acquiring payment technologies as it seeks to widen and deepen its footprint on a global scale as the payments industry consolidates.,"First Data (FDC) announced it has acquired ayCash for an undisclosed amount.ayCash operates as a cashless payment terminal and retail services provider in Germany.FDC is continuing to acquire payment processors in major countries that are prone to adopting wider use of electronic payments.Nuremberg, Germany-based ayCash was founded in 2008 to provide German businesses with cashless payment terminals and digital merchant services.Management is headed by Founder and Managing Director Hans Hezel, who was previously Manager TeleCash Operations / Senior Project Manager at First Data.ayCash’ primary offerings include:According to a market research report by Statista, the digital payments market in Germany recorded a total transaction value of $104 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach $149 billion by 2023, as can be seen by the following graphic:This represents a CAGR of 5.9% between 2017 and 2023.FDC didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance. So the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of December 31, 2018, FDC had $555 million in cash and equivalents and $31.3 billion in total liabilities, of which settlement obligations represented $11.4 billion and long-term debt accounted for $16.4 billion.Free cash flow during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was $2 billion.In the past 12 months, FDC’s stock price has risen 58.5% vs. Global Payments’ (GPN) rise of 17.8%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoEarnings surprises in the past 12 quarters have been mostly positive, although the firm’s Q3 negative surprise was a standout:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst ratings are largely centered on a ‘Hold’ rating and the consensus price target of $26.09 implies only a 3.4% upside from the stock’s current price of $25.22 at press time:Source: Seeking AlphaFDC acquired ayCash to expand its footprint within the largest country economy in Europe.As John Gibbons, EVP, Head of EMEA at First Data stated in the deal announcement,With consumer attitudes changing toward increased convenience of electronic payments, First Data has increased its acquisition activity to gain geographic reach.First Data itself is being acquired by Fiserv (FISV) and recently acquired Software Express, a payment processor in Brazil.With the deal for ayCash, FDC also gains expertise on the ground for the Girocard interbank network connection German ATMs as well as credit card acceptance for DACH-based merchants.While the acquisition won’t move the needle for FDC in the short term, it provides investors with another data point showing management’s focus on expanding within major economies that have shown themselves to be conducive to adopting increased electronic payment penetration.I expect to see additional acquisitions by Fiserv/FDC as the trend toward payments technology consolidation continues in the industry."
4260441,101850,2019-05-06T08:23:20-04:00,"Fiserv Inc. and First Data Corp. are heading toward a merger.The all-share deal is expected to be finalized in 3Q 2019.The transaction should generate a substantial amount of revenue and cost synergies while facilitating a deleveraging process.1Q 2019 financial results are positive and on track to reach the company's full-year earnings guidance, with payment segments as the key driver.The expansive global processing industry is a tailwind that bodes well for this transaction.","Fiserv Inc. (FISV) and First Data Corporation (FDC) are expected to finalize their merger in 3Q 2019 through an all-share transaction, with FISV as the surviving entity. We think the M&A transaction is compelling due to the significant amount of revenue & cost synergies, as well as the resulting enhanced financial position. Upon successful integration, FISV will be able to cross-sell additional services from FDC and integrate the technology & cost structure of both companies. However, we think leverage is a key concern the combined entity will need to address in order to achieve successful integration.On balance, we think the deal is compelling for investors, who will be rewarded for scooping up FISV shares by 1) the compelling long-term growth potential of the global payments processing industry, which could reach the $3 trillion revenue mark in 5 years, and 2) synergistic benefits from the successful integration of FISV and FDC's business (revenue synergy guidance of $500 million and cost synergy guidance of $900 million by year five).Fiserv and First Data Corporation announced earlier this year that their Boards of Directors had approved the merger. Terms of the all-share deal dictate that FDC shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.303 FSV shares for each FDC shares they own, or an implied equity value of $26.28 per share, only a slight premium of 2% over FDC’s closing price as of 3rd May, 2019. Post close, Fiserv will be the surviving company. Fiserv CEO Jeff Yabuki will assume the leadership role as CEO of the combined entities, while Frank Bisignano (FDC’s current CEO) will be COO.From all angles, this looks like a done deal with expectations that this will be finalized in 3Q 2019. We believe that the transaction should pass regulatory hurdles, since there is a little overlap between both businesses and competition is high in the payment processing industry. In addition, another bidder on FDC seems unlikely at this point, given the deal structure and positioning.Management expects that the M&A will create one of the world’s leading payments and financial technology providers. We agree, and see the transaction as compelling given the potential to generate: a) revenue synergy from cross-selling opportunities, b) cost synergy from the integration of technology infrastructure and streamlining operations, and c) enhancement in financial position through refinancing of debt and continued deleveraging.Revenue SynergyThe revenue of the combined entity amounts to $14.2 billion, based on 2018 FISV and FDC revenues. Revenue synergies are guided to gradually increase by $500 million a year in the next five years, mainly through an expanded payment offering and network innovation derived from cross-selling additional services. We believe guidance is fair, but think there may also be upside considering the increased geographical presence and improved capabilities of the merged entity.Cost SynergyIn addition to revenue synergies, c. $900 million of annual recurring cost savings will be achieved through consolidation of technology infrastructure, removal of corporate structure redundancies, streamlined operations and process improvements.The merged company will channel the annual cost savings to further digitalize bank channels and build on its technology platform. Key areas include expansion of its merchant solutions, improvement of risk management capabilities, the rollout of data-focused solutions and expanding eCommerce channels. Moreover, they will be investing in real-time payments and helping clients improve connectivity.Enhanced Financial PositionOne of the key success factors in the integration of both FISV and FDC is the ability of the combined entity to deleverage its balance sheet. We think this should be a key priority, taking precedence over further growth strategies.Considering the combined entity will have a bank debt of c. $17 billion, refinancing this bank debt to reduce interest expense seems logical. In the coming years, FISV’s strong cash flow generation (~EBITDA of $5.1 billion in the no-growth scenario) will be utilized to deleverage the balance sheet. Moreover, we see further divestments of FDC’s underperforming assets, with sales proceeds to be immediately employed to accelerate debt reduction.Overall, we estimate immediate EPS accretion to be $0.34, or EPS of $3.91 for the combined entity - a 24.5% year-on-year hike. Due to the notable potential synergies discussed above, we would not be surprised if EPS reaches north of $8 in FY 2024, which implies a 10.84X FY 2024 P/E.Fiserv's 1Q 2019 financial results show that the company delivered in line with expectations and maintained its full-year 2019 financial results guidance. It reported revenues of $1.50 billion in 1Q 2019, or 9% year-on-year growth. The modest top line growth was driven by robust expansion in its payment segment, offsetting a 3% decline in Financials segment from the sale of its 55% interest in the lending solutions business. Accordingly, adjusted earnings per share increased by 12% year on year to $0.84 per share in the quarter, with the company remaining on track to report adjusted earnings of $3.39-3.52 per share, ex-acquisition of FDC.The recent FISV quarterly report validates our view that there is considerable growth potential in global payments processing, and this tailwind supports the M&A case for Fiserv and FDC. According to McKinsey reports, global revenues generated from the global processing industry reached $1.9 trillion, with projections to grow to $3 trillion within the 5-year horizon.We believe that the Fiserv and FDC merger would create a global processing company that will generate value for both customers and shareholders from cross-selling opportunities and cost efficiencies. Consequently, we think this newly merged company will thrive in an expansive global payment processing industry. While we do acknowledge there are risks (as discussed above), a much stronger Fiserv will be more than adequately equipped to tackle these concerns head-on."
4197303,104662,2018-08-09T16:34:43-04:00,Fiserv has remained under the radar despite a long history of strong performance.The fintech landscape has created a need for innovation through acquisition strategies.Fiserv has excellent key ratios as it plans to continue acquiring companies and expanding their fintech capabilities.Fiserv protects their market share through vendor lock-in and multi-year contracts.Market share protection and a relative valuation lead me to believe that Fiserv is still undervalued despite their excellent performance.,"Fiserv (FISV) has long been a darling for their shareholders. It serves as a way to invest in the financial technology industry, as well as grant exposure to the banking sector. Over the past several years, Fiserv has consistently beat the Dow and S&P 500, while also having 32 consecutive years of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.But, Fiserv is not a “trending” company in the financial industry. Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) see all the headlines, and are where investors go when they want to invest in fintech. Below, I will outline why I believe bank IT spending will continue to grow, how Fiserv is expanding while protecting their market share and revenue, and how these factors lead to Fiserv still being undervalued despite share prices rising 25% YoY.Source: Fiserv IR (Presentation)The fintech industry is growing. Adoption rates are rising globally, and investments are flowing into fintech start-ups (for more information in why I think the overall fintech industry will grow, please see my PayPal article).Banks are feeling the pressure from fintech companies in areas such as payments, lending, investing etc. and must change with the new environment. Banks are unlikely to be replaced by fintech companies, but will still need to understand and improve their technological capabilities. JP Morgan (JPM) alone spent $9.5 billion in technology in 2016, and across the whole industry, IT spending is projected to grow yearly.Source: Celent (Report)The company posed to benefit the most from this? Fiserv, who supports over one-third of U.S. financial institutions.Banks will need to increase their IT capabilities to survive. The industry conditions present a welcoming future for Fiserv, but they will now face more risk, as pressure to provide the latest advancements in fintech will allow competitors an opportunity to steal market share if Fiserv falls behind.To counteract this, Fiserv will embrace a strategy that other fintech companies have seen success with: innovation through acquisition. Within the last year, Fiserv has made two notable acquisitions: Dovetail and Monetize. Dovetail increased capabilities in the payments area, while Monetize improved their IT architecture. Since 2016, Fiserv has made six major acquisitions to improve their technological capabilities.Fiserv has yet to see these acquisitions and other innovations expand beyond the financial IT industry. With the trend of customers skipping banks by using mobile wallets, it is surprising Fiserv hasn’t made a successful push to enter this industry themselves, with mobile wallet solutions only offered as a product to their financial institution customers. Unless this happens, Fiserv will still rely on financial institutions as their customer base.Fiserv enjoys some of the market share protection that enterprise software companies benefit from. This includes high-switching costs, which creates a barrier of entry for other companies to steal market share from Fiserv. Not only will these companies need to offer better solutions or a lower price than Fiserv, they also have to create an offer that will outweigh the extra costs associated with leaving Fiserv.Fiserv also operates on a subscription basis, locking in financial institutions into a multi-year contract, providing Fiserv with a stable revenue source from these deals. As Fiserv becomes ingrained into a bank's operations from these multi-year deals, customers will be less likely to leave Fiserv, as it will cause a disruption to switch vendors.These two benefits of Fiserv lead us to the final benefit, vendor lock-in. As I discussed in my last article, “Vendor lock-in is where a customer uses one company as their main cloud provider, and the cloud infrastructure becomes so ingrained into the customer’s business that a customer is “locked in” with this software. This gives the vendor pricing power, and leads to an overall shift of power as the customer is a victim to whatever terms the vendor gives.”This means that Fiserv can create a moat around their existing customer base. When a customer begins to enter a vendor contract with Fiserv, Fiserv is able to push more products and services. The continued expansion of services to their current customers allow Fiserv to become a critical component of the bank’s operations, allowing Fiserv to push more services, while also giving Fiserv leverage in negotiations of long-term contracts and pricing power.As discussed, financial institutions will need to embrace fintech in order to compete and survive. With 12,000 customers, Fiserv serves several institutions that don’t have the technological or monetary resources to create fintech solutions in-house. And as bank IT spending grows across the industry, more banks will look to Fiserv, and current customers will expand to use more of Fiserv’s services.Fiserv is not alone in pursing the innovation through acquisition strategy. Banks, PayPal, Square and Fidelity (FIS) are all going to be paying close attention to the growing fintech landscape. With the possibility of bidding wars for in-demand start-ups a growing risk, there is a risk of short-term hits to Fiserv's bottom line if there are situations of over-paying.Also, this strategy isn’t unique to Fiserv. If a competitor of Fiserv makes a couple of acquisitions that create a better product than what Fiserv can offer, Fiserv’s market share will suffer. This risk should not be overlooked, as the fintech industry is constantly changing, and companies such as PayPal are beginning to create a financial operating system, which could present future risks if PayPal expands to becoming a vendor for financial institutions.It should also be said that Fiserv’s consumer base is still financial institutions. This means any changes to banking regulations can affect Fiserv, along with anything that happens to the industry as a whole. If consumers begin to adopt mobile wallets and move away from banks, this will also present a risk to Fiserv.Fiserv isn’t talked about as much as Square and PayPal. This may lead to Fiserv presenting an undervalued investment for investors seeking exposure to fintech. Below, I compare Fiserv to similar companies in PayPal and Fidelity, and competitors Jack Henry & Associates (JKHY) and ACI Worldwide (ACIW).Source: Data from Yahoo Finance, Organized by Author. Market Cap and EV are in billions. Although Fidelity is long considered to be Fiserv’s direct competitor, I believe PayPal will be who Fiserv will be competing against most directly in the future, especially in acquiring fintech start-ups. Fiserv should also see less competition from Jack Henry and ACI in terms of spending on acquisitions, based off of the size differences. We see Fiserv have favorable metrics in terms of EV/EBITDA, Forward P/E, and P/S to PayPal, while having similar metrics to Fidelity in everything but PEG, P/S and P/B. As an average, Fiserv’s ratios suggest a slight undervaluation possibility.The PEG is concerning, as that is one of my favored metrics. Ignoring PEG for the moment, we see Fiserv lineup favorably compared to PayPal. Fiserv and PayPal are both more aggressive in offering better fintech solutions, so I believe overall, Fiserv is undervalued compared to their competitors. More importantly, if Fiserv continues to see success with their fintech acquisitions and eventually challenges PayPal, Fiserv then presents an even greater undervalued investment.However, going back to the PEG ratio, we will look at revenue growth, which is the more concerning metric I have seen with Fiserv. In the last quarter, we saw revenue growth increase 2% YoY, which comes from a 7% growth in payments and -5% growth in financial segments, However, the -5% was influenced by the sale of a stake in their Lending Solutions business, which will contaminate our ratios. Fiserv gives us a 6% revenue growth labeled as Internal Revenue Growth. As this trickles down, the company's adjusted EPS growth has hit 27% YTD, compared to 2017 YTD. This changes the PEG ratio to be between 21.66 (P/E) / 27 = .8 PEG and 21.66 (P/E) / 22 = .98 PEG based on guidance (22% - 27% EPS growth), which now gives an excellent mark for investors.With favorable ratios compared to their competitors, and an estimated PEG ratio hovering below 1, I believe Fiserv is an undervalued investment in fintech.Note: Internal Revenue is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is subject to an amount of interpretation by Fiserv. Please read the press release for more information.Fintech has several trending names making big news, which has lead to Fiserv seeing limited press coverage, and limited analyst coverage. But Fiserv has been making moves to increase their profit margins, and set up future growth through acquisitions. A key for Fiserv will be their ability to provide their customers with the most up-to-date innovations in a fast growing industry.Investors looking for a good value in fintech should strongly consider Fiserv over other trending names. Fiserv’s excellent history of EPS growth and wide customer base provide a higher floor than the other names, but Fiserv will need to make several changes (such as the turnkey Zelle solution monetization/expansion) to match the growth potential of other fintech stocks. I believe Fiserv has an excellent future growth path while providing an undervalued investment for investors. Current investors should feel confident that Fiserv can continue their performance in years to come.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

The company's operations continue to gain traction in the ISV space, driving top line growth. Moreover, its recent acquisitions are beginning to experience synergies. Its share price recently broke above key resistance levels, signaling more upward momentum could be on the way. I am buying stock in this name as fundamentals are driving investor optimism higher.FDC looks attractively positioned at current levels due to the continued traction with its Clover platform, its synergies generated from recent acquisitions, as well as management's commitment to debt reduction.The company provides electronic commerce solutions for merchants, financial institutions, and card issuers worldwide. It operates through three segments: Global Business Solutions (GBS), Global Financial Solutions (GFS), and Network & Security Solutions (NSS).Management continues to see impressive expansion as its users recognize Clover’s strength as an integrated platform, according to its earnings call. FDC is processing nearly $58 billion of annualized volume globally on Clover, up more than 50% year over year.As Clover continues to grow in the U.S., expanding its addressable market, management is leveraging its global presence by launching in key international markets like Germany this year. Clover also continues to be recognized by customers and industry analysts as a leading solution in the marketplace and the number of ISVs who want to integrate to the platform continues to grow, according to management.FDC is seeing strong momentum in the ISV business, as is seen in a few recent partnerships. Millennium Systems International is a prominent software provider in the salon and spa industry, processing billions of transactions annually across 36 countries, according to management. Millennium’s new cloud-based product MEBO will be integrated to FDC's platform, protecting their clients with the security of FDC's PCI validated point-to-point encrypted devices.Moreover, Community Brands has a portfolio of nine large ISVs, serving associations, non-profits and government entities. They will be using the FDC platform to power integrated payments across their portfolio. Both of those deals were major competitive takeaways in the ISV space, according to its earnings call. Finally, Ellie May, a leading provider of business management software for mortgage lenders has completed its integration to process payments for all their future mortgage application and appraisal fees with FDC.One-third of mortgage loan applications in the U.S. are processed through Ellie May today, making this a major partnership for the company. Recent successes for FDC are thus an affirmation of its value proposition in the ISV market.Additionally, acquisitions of CardConnect and BluePay have positioned FDC with industry-leading ISV capabilities that are attractive to software developers. Management has done a solid job thus far integrating the two companies in ways that will improve the production of its existing partner base. The size and scale of FDC with its recent acquisitions and the additional investments made in these acquisitions should further accelerate growth in coming quarters.FDC's enterprise backlog has similarly increased by more than 50% to more than $300 million in recent quarters. The company's ability to present its clients with the broadest suite of innovative market-leading products and solutions uniquely positions them to serve enterprise level clients to start on a global basis, according to its earnings call.The company is also having success on its merchant side, recently signing a number of new enterprise clients, while expanding previous relationships. For example, FDC won a deal with Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to provide credit and debit card processing for riders as well as a direct to debit disbursement solution for driver payouts, according to its earnings call. This will be a large addressable market for the company in coming quarters. They also further expanded their relationship with Walmart (WMT) adding signature debit acceptance to the full range of products and services offered at WMT.Below is a chart of both the company's revenue and earnings per share. Over the last few years, the company's revenue has steadily risen as its operations gained traction. Moreover, management's commitment to efficiency brought the company from a per share loss to now a per share profit.Debt reduction remains a primary focus going forward, with a leverage ratio of 4 times by the end of next year being the target. FDC's net debt decreased $239 million from year-end 2017 driven primarily by free cash flow generated in the quarter. Its leverage ratio defined as net debt to segment EBITDA was 5.8 times at March 31, down from 6.0 times at December 31st.Over the last few years, management has been successful at reducing the company's debt levels, as is seen below in the debt to assets chart. From July 2015 through current day, the debt to asset ratio has fallen from over 60%, to around 40% now, representing a significant reduction.FDC's share price is breaking out higher following strengthening fundamental operations. As its acquisitions and Clover platform have gained traction, top line growth has similarly improved, leading its share price higher. The most recent breakout above the $18 level was significant as this level had acted as strong resistance in recent years. Further operational improvements and strengthening of its balance sheet should continue the stock's upward momentum.FDC is seeing its share price break out higher on continued operational strength. The company's operations continue to gain traction in the ISV space, driving top line growth. Moreover, its recent acquisitions are beginning to experience synergies.

(FISV) are down 4.97% since peaking on September 28, 2018, and in my opinion, the shares of this provider of account processing systems and electronic payments processing products are a solid buy at current price levels. The company has a solid history of generating impressive earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued growth over the next twelve months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ) plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ, please see my blog post).As of the end of October 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 was 9.21.The current MGQ for FISV stands at 15.42, which implies a 53.36% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that FISV has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel for how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.Caveat Lector: I am Quant Trader - that is, I seek to understand market behaviour by using mathematical and statistical modelling, measurement, and research.

The company's 5-year average operating margin growth rate was 3.40% per year.Knowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backward. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about FISV.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).FISV has a forward P/E of 21.93 compared to a 17.10 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for FISV is higher than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are higher than that of the broader market, and thus, they will be willing to pay more for the shares for the higher growth rate.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for FISV stands at 17.44%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 17.44% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of October was at 8.03%, so FISV has an implied potential rate of return that is 2.17x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, there is a high probability of a rally to the $82.00 level from here:I will buy call options for FISV to participate in the anticipated run to $82.00. To view the option details (strike price, expiry date, and leverage), you can sign up for a Free Trial for The Options Trader. Only members receive detailed trade alerts.For investors in the shares, I recommend that you hold for 3 months or $82.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe FISV is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.When looking for companies to invest in, I like to find ones with a management team that has outperformed its peers in the same industry in regards to effectively turning revenue into profits and generating returns for shareholders.Management EffectivenessSource: ReutersThis is a company that with a management team that is very good at throwing dollars to the bottom line compared to its peers, and generating higher-than-average returns on equity.The chart below shows the company's revenue TTM trend over the last three years - you can see that the trend remains to the upside - and with management's ability to convert revenue into profits these shares should recover from their recent pullback and climb higher over the next three to twelve months.The recent price drop in the shares presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position in FISV.FISV data by YChartsWhen I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, FISV is a compelling buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."
4176819,100296,2018-05-24T09:00:51-04:00,Continued growth of free cash flow and earnings per share propels Fiserv forward.Acquisitions provide a diversified and deep financial technology platform that create seamless integration across Fiserv's platforms.Financial technology tailwinds provide optimistic outlook for Fiserv.,"One of the hottest spaces in the market right now is financial technology, or as its more commonly referred to as, Fintech. The fintech market ins being driven by innovations in digital payments, online crowdfunding, robo-advisors in wealth management services, and lending services. Fiserv (FISV) provides solutions in payments, billing, financial optimization, and risk management. It's a pretty broad suite of solutions that other companies in the space are certainly competing in, but Fiserv has also been on a hot streak of acquisitions as of late in order to diversify their products and offer more niche services including acquisitions of Monitise, and Dovetail, among others. Through both customer development, product growth, and acquistions, Fiserv has been able to consistently meet or exceed earnings expectations and drive revenue forward at high rates.Before diving into some of the innovations that Fiserv has been making recently, it's important to take a look at how Fiserv has been performing in recent years and expectations moving forward into 2018 and beyond.Since Fiserv has been growing significantly through its purchase of smaller financial technology companies, its free cash flow is of significant note when observing its financials. Free cash flow growth has slowed and is almost stagnant in recent years, up just 4.8% from 2016 through 2017 from $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. However, in that period, Fiserv spent $632 million in cash on acquisitions. The three years before that, they only spent a combined $30 million. Adjusting for acquisitions, 2016 free cash flow would be $1.4 billion and 2017 free cash flow would be $1.56 billion, representing an increase of 11% year over year. With the current run of acquisitions, it's a trend that is likely to increase as larger players like PayPal (PYPL) continue to buy up smaller players in the space to get ahead of the fintech competition. This will put the pressure on Fiserv to keep its portfolio of products at the cutting edge of the industry. However, the payback has shown in both revenues, net income, and margin growth. Fiserv had revenue growth in 2017 off its heavy acquisitions in 2016, but it was not as significant as its growth in net income and its margin improvements. Revenue grew only 3.5% in 2017; however, net income grew 32.5% from $930 million to over $1.2 billion. Net income margins also improved from 16.9% to 21.6%. What's evident is that while the acquisitions may not be providing significant revenue growth (at least not yet), they are serving to streamline processes within Fiserv's core platforms, allowing for Fiserv to cut down on operational costs and contribute more to the bottom line. Along with recent corporate tax cuts, Fiserv's margin growth should continue to be strong going forward.Investors shouldn't worry too much about revenue growth not exploding. Compared to its industry peers in the payment processing market, Fiserv is growing revenue and net income at a greater rate. The main competitors in the space with Fiserv are Fidelity Information Services and PayPal.CSI Market, FISV vs. Competitors, Q1, 2018.While it may seem worrying that Fiserv has leveraged itself more in recent years, it has provided a moat of protection with its strong financial performance. Financial leverage has increased from 3.51 to 3.77 in the past two years, but interest coverage has increased from 7.25 to 8.80. A significant acquisition made by Fiserv was of Dovetail back in late August of 2017. Dovetail provides a real-time payments platform, modular services, and configurable business processing rules which allows financial institutions to unify discrete solutions into a single integrated payments structure. The real-time capabilities of Dovetail integrated with Fiserv's existing payment processing software allows Fiserv to provide financial institutions with more solutions and services, creating more ways in which Fiserv's clients can and should use their platform. It will also allow banks in Europe especially to replace their legacy software solutions with the faster and more integrated Fiserv products. In September of 2017, Fiserv completed the acquisition of Montise. One of the key components of Montise's technology is FINkit, which is a cloud solution built for financial institutions that allows companies to accelerate delivery of digital solutions, giving those who use the technology an advantage for getting their products to market faster. Fiserv Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Yabuki said of the acquisition, ""Combining its talented associates and advanced technologies with leading digital solutions from Fiserv will expand our clients' ability to provide differentiated experiences to their customers."" Fiserv isn't just acquiring companies that will provide itself synergies; its acquisitions are providing added value to Fiserv's clients that are then passed on to the financial institutions' clients. The value chain is greatly strengthened, creating higher demand for Fiserv products.The acquisitions have provided added, tangible values for Fiserv's financials. Integrated with Fiserv's Mobiliti technology, the acquisitions have helped to streamline processes and attract new clients, resulting in Mobiliti subscriptions to grow 25% in Q1 2018. Total Mobiliti business users have grown 50% in 2018 as value continues to move down the chain from Fiserv's technology to financial institutions to the financial institutions' clients. Adjusted Q1 2018 revenues grew 7% to $770 million. Peer-to-peer transactions grew 20% on the heels of innovations by Fiserv in its billing solutions and payment processing services.Mobiliti Licensed Version, FiservThe picture above displays the different integrations and features that the Mobiliti platform has developed into, providing a seamless and multi-faceted banking application for consumers.CEO Yabuki sees a strong outlook for the fintech space. Institutions look to update their back office technology, bring better solutions to their customers to gain competitive edges, and also invest in risk, fraud protection, and cyber-security. While the adaptation of all of these technologies and overhaul of legacy systems won't occur in just a couple years, spending will continue to rise and firms continue to invest in the future. Fiserv's value add is as a multi-decade market leader. Fiserv has relationships with all the major financial institutions and dominates market share in the bank core processing space with 37%. Their recent string of acquisitions both streamlines processes which improves margins but also strengthens the value chain for Fiserv's clients, creating a greater demand for the solutions that allow financial institutions to hold a competitive advantage by using Fiserv's products. And despite being the market leader, Fiserv's revenue growth year-over-year is still above the industry average, showing that it is continuing to gain market share. Investors should consider the risk of financial institutions developing products in-house. As the fintech market grows in size and financial institutions increasingly use it in their operations, they may develop their own teams to create comparable products. In October of 2017, J.P. Morgan acquired WePay for over $220 million.Moving forward, the demand for the fastest and most integrated fintech products will continue to rise, putting the pressure on Fiserv to continue to stay ahead of the quickly changing fintech space. Fiserv is not a cheap stock, but its growth prospects are certainly very strong moving forward. The explosion in share price over the past few years may worry some investors that a correction may be coming for Fiserv. While these risks present themselves, the fintech space is one of the best places to hitch your wagon to, and spending on fintech will continue to grow at extremely high rates for the years to come"
4108160,103231,2017-09-19T22:51:58-04:00,"Fiserv continues to enhance its client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions.FIS integration with SunGard is starting to return value to investors as returns bounce back.While a possible tax reform seems to be priced in for both companies, the current valuations support their current prices.","The digital arena for financial services and the provision made by major providers these days are immense. From a simple bill-payment process and card-based transaction to direct account transfers, the complexity of financial services and digital payment has been opportune to financial technology firms. The digital shift has seen an exponential growth over the last few years, with companies coming out with innovative and strategic ways to dominate the financial services space.Payment systems around the globe help ensure inherent technology to support monetary transactions from an individual or entity to another. With disruptive technologies in the financial technology (Fintech) sector, start-ups are targeting customer convenience, security, adherence to regulatory compliance and technical infrastructure. Fintech covers a wider perspective and incorporates not just payment gateways but alternatives to manual wealth management, business processing, asset management, venture capitalism and customer connectivity to consider the least.Breakdown of the payment processCompanies like Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISV) and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE: FIS) have held dominance in the fintech sector, with strong fundamentals and key acquisitions in the past years. With American Banker ranking Fiserv third by revenue for 2015 in its domain and FIS bagging number one spot in IDC Fintech, such achievements signal volumes about how the companies have come a long way in terms of innovation and value creation for their stakeholders. For financial institutions outsourcing payment services to fintech firms, the cost of maintaining physical and virtual infrastructure and risk indulgence is significantly brought down.Source: Filings from the SECFiserv primarily operates by dealing in electronic payment processing, mobile and internet banking, account processing, services in source capturing and cash management with financial institutes and other companies carrying out similar transactions. With two major acquisitions lined up for completion this year, the company has served expansionary motives by acquiring Dovetail Group Limited and enhancing its payment infrastructure, and Monitise plc [LSE: MONI] for $98 million by diversifying into the digital suite domain. With Zelle enabling people to directly transfer money relying on a user’s email address and mobile number, Fiserv has supported the platform - a frictionless path for P2P solutions. Major revenue driver for Fiserv has been its payment segment, by offering 24-hour access to its digital platforms to financial institutions like banks and companies alike, with a recorded revenue growth of 6% as on March 2017 from December 2016 last year.Source: Filings from the SECFurther intensifying the fintech sector, Fidelity National Information Services offers solutions both in enterprise banking and retail domain, covering a plethora of services in payments, capital markets, insurance, risk and regulatory compliance and financial consulting. FIS has been serving its clients in close to 130 geographies, thus providing holistic consulting and outsourcing solutions. As a Fortune 500 company, the firm has come a long way to be a member of the S&P 500 Index. The corporate and global financial solution (GFS) segment for the firm boosted revenue by 37% and 3% as on March 2017 compared with December 2016 numbers.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECFiserv has recorded a 26% margin figure in its cash from operating activities, thus showcasing the efficiency the firm has witnessed over the last 3 years in terms of controlling variable costs and driving operations to garner profits. In line with above numbers, EBITDA margin is promising at 30%, though the indicator is not a comprehensive measure as it involves superfluous costs. Comparable numbers are showcased by EBIT margin positioned at 26% in Q2 this year. ROE stands at 38% for 2016 with the 3-year average at 30%, portraying strengthening claims of profitability. The firm substantiates profitability figures which accounted for an ROIC of 13%. Higher returns for Fiserv are as a result of increase in financial leverage, which is depicted by a rising debt to equity ratio from 1.073x three years back to the current ratio of 1.983x. Though leverage has witnessed a hike in the last couple of years, the company has been paying back its debt on time by keeping robust levels of EBITDA in comparison with its long-term liabilities.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECExploring Fiserv’s turnover ratios, the company has only managed to produce close to $0.58 of sales for every $1 invested as an asset. This figure has more likely hovered in the range of $0.56-0.58, claiming stability the last 2 years. Certain reasons may be responsible for it including major acquisitions this year and adherence to regulatory government compliance, thus transforming asset into sales. The figures can be an indication for investors to rely on fundamentals of the firm in the long run, in terms of the underlying profitability that FISV offers. Also, since corporate segment for the firm has dwindled over the last couple of years, a major chunk of investments must have been diverted there. The firm followed a major repurchase program in the quarter with 2.5 million shares for $295 million, returning $684 million back to the shareholders through June 2017.On the contrary, FIS did not exhibit promising numbers with total asset turnover standing at 0.37x from 0.25x. The numbers have improved, yet conversion investment in assets to 0.37 in sales does not compare to industry average as a whole. EBIT margins as an indicator of company’s earnings ability saw a significant decline from 17% in 2015 to 15% in Q2 2017. Pressure on both firms in terms of tax burden is 68% and 62%, respectively, with a major chunk of sales diverted as taxes. Though major segments have been performing well, tax norms in the sector need easing so that net income attributable to shareholders in the longer run can improve. The cash flow from operating activities relates to 19% from operations which is less than the one recorded by Fiserv. The ROIC at 5% might seem a bit constrained because of the recent acquisition of SunGard, owing to which the combined firm annual revenue may stand at $9 million, with 2017 likely to showcase improved earnings. Similar trend is exemplified by ROE of 8% which is near the industry average of 7.2%.For both Fiserv and FIS, the free cash flow to the firm comes at an average of 16% over three years, sustaining the repurchase program implemented by the management of both companies. Moreover, historical trends in dividend payment from FIS may be expanded over the next quarters, increasing the dividend yield due to healthy levels of free cash flow. Gross margins for FIS have increased owing to improved margins from processing item solutions and by charging an increased termination fee. In accordance, with integrative service and cost management initiatives by FIS, improved operating margins thus sustain revamped signals for investors.Source: Calculated using information extracted from the SECThe market ratios provide some key insights to an investor and help make investment decisions. Both the firms, though incurring profits and revenue growth, still fall short of fundamentals. A look at the valuation ratios for the two firms provides a stronger picture in order to make a call on whether to buy the stocks or not. For FISV, revenue growth may not seem that evident, but for value stocks a company might appear optimistic based on higher margins, free cash flows, a promising and good enough P/E ratio and similar factors. Similarly, FIS with its disciplined capital structure, improved profit margins and dividend payments combined with a P/E multiple of 27.67x looks like an encouraging investment. Firms in the financial services sector undergo high tax rate compliance, incurring huge tax expenses, and could benefit from a tax reform in the future. Both Fiserv and FIS have a low EV/EBITDA at 16.95x and 14.52x, respectively, delivering an undervalued stock compared to the industry.FISV data by YChartsThe companies have outperformed the market in the last couple of years, but a rare slump should not deter investors from taking positions. One of possible triggers for the stock can be Zelle as a diversifying segment, which will support FISV for transferring money through the P2P platforms within a fraction of seconds. This will not only ensure segment expansion but also prowess FISV in the domain, competing with apps from PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ) which have garnered considerable market share since inception. Investors, as a result, can expect strong boost in volumes and future revenue growth. For FIS, double-digit average growth has been observed for the past few years, a major splurge in earnings due to some recent acquisitions and synergies. The company is up for a roll and revenue growth is likely to be in the range of 3-5%. Generous dividend yields provided by the firm speak about the firm's underlying value in comparison with rival companies. As a leader ranked number one in a host of recent surveys, FIS has been emerging as one of the best investments in the financial technology space."

When a company issues additional shares, a shareholder's existing ownership stake is reduced. This is a problem for shareholders that, while obvious, I believe deserves significantly more focus.As we know, intelligent, predictable buybacks tend to have a positive impact on price return, with firms that effect buybacks enjoying significant price returns in the following period. Given my strong opinions about diluting the shareholder base with repeated bouts of equity offerings, I decided to check out what the academic research has to say about it.An article in the Journal of Financial Economics suggests that seasoned equity offerings have significant negative returns in the subsequent five-year period (emphasis added):This is confirmed in further research:An article in the Journal of Finance states (emphasis added):An article titled Equity Issues and Offering Dilution from the Journal of Financial Economics has some fascinating insights about it (emphasis added):It goes on to suggest:So basically, here are a few things we may be able to glean from the research:Let's apply this to FDC.As we can see from the chart below that, over the last year, FDC has diluted its shareholders by 379%.FDC Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsLet's explore just how extraordinary this cost is for shareholders of FDC. Let's say you buy 1,000 shares of FDC today at ~$15.88, when FDC has 923.47m shares outstanding.Source: Author's WorkLet's say, over the next five years, FDC achieves the unbelievably challenging feat of doubling its revenue. And, let's say, that because investors love to reward revenue, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off!But let's say that, during that time, ceteris paribus, FDC has diluted the shareholder base by 379% (as per the dilution in its recent history). Now, there are ~4.5b shares outstanding.Source: Author's WorkHolding all else constant: even though the company doubled its revenue in our scenario, it diluted its shareholder base. Instead of your shares being worth $31.76 per share, because of the dilution, they're now worth only $6.49 per share. That means that revenue per share has actually decreased, from $12.82 to $5.35.Instead of your share of ownership being worth a little over $31k, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're worth less: only $6.5k.No matter how bullish you are regarding FDC's prospects, if it continues to dilute its shareholder base, you may not profit from that growth. A valuation increase doesn't guarantee a share increase because we're rewarded on a per share basis. Because of dilution, your return is muted. No matter how great the company's prospects are, if it continues to dilute its shareholder base, shareholders will not reap the benefits from that growth.If the research above is correct and firms which engage in secondary offerings experience poor price and operational performance for the subsequent five-year period, FDC shareholders may be paying for that dilution for several years yet.As we know, goodwill is the intangible asset that arises when a company pays a premium to acquire another. Excess goodwill is a risk for shareholders, as goodwill can become impaired.A significant percentage of FDC's capital structure is made up of goodwill.Source: 10-QIn fact, nearly half of its total assets are comprised of goodwill:Source: Author's WorkExcess goodwill, of course, creates the risk of destroying shareholder value via write-downs in which the company must book an impairment charge. With so much of its capital structure comprised of goodwill, if its goodwill becomes impaired, the company will suffer an immediate hit to earnings and many of its ""assets"" will evaporate.It's possible that in the future FDC will reduce its equity offerings and engage in share repurchases. For now, considering the research regarding seasoned equity offerings negatively affecting performance for following three- and five-year periods, management may be signalling that it believes its shares to be overvalued. Based on the sheer volume of its dilution, as well as its goodwill-heavy capital structure, I believe investors would be wise to give FDC a pass and look for value elsewhere."
4138452,102170,2018-01-18T13:31:03-05:00,Company is involved in all facets of global payment transactions.Exposure to a growing European segment.Paying down and refinancing debt to improve flexibility and operating leverage.Improved financial performance and good near-term outlook.,"First Data Corporation (FDC) is a large player in the global payment transaction industry. The company may not be synonymous to the public unlike its competitors, but you may have come across some of their brands, such as Money Network, Star Network, TransArmor, VisionPLUS and the Clover point-of-sale system. I know I have seen those decals on doors and windows. Now, these names might not be as sexy as some of its competitors, namely PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), but the two aforementioned rivals only provide some of the services of FDC.I think it is important to show a visualization of the FDC's network.Both Square and PayPal are largely known for their Gateway services, which is depicted between the POS and consumers and consumer and card issuer processor. FDC provides solutions for the whole ecosystem to their clients. Before we dive deeper, let's go back to the Great Recession to learn a little more about FDC's recent history.The company was bought by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) in 2007 and had an IPO in October 2015. At that time, FDC's balance sheet was loaded with debt and had to pay annual management fees to KKR. Currently, KKR holds the majority of the combined voting power of the common stock. KKR has the ability to elect all of the members of the Board of Directors. Well, this is not that great for shareholders not name KKR.FDC Total Return Price data by YChartsAs we can see, FDC has been left in the dust. For all the hoopla generated by PYPL and SQ (rightfully so), Fiserv (FISV) has really done well for itself. Man, FDC must feel like John Smith coming back to Roanoke Colony in North Carolina and seeing that everyone has left. It is probably easy to say that the weight of the debt and KKR's control really was not well received by current and potential shareholders.That was then, but now, there are many great things working on FDC's behalf. I think that FDC can ride the coattails of both SQ and PYPL. These two companies really have driven popularity to simpler transactions and education in the payment processing ecosystem. FDC's loyalty suite promotes engagement through rewards, customer feedback and data. FDC has partnered with Apple Pay and Android Pay to help merchants better engage with their customers with rewards, promotions and coupons through the Clover terminal. There is nothing like a coupon sent to your email that gives you reason to go shop at that store or the website. This is one tactic to continue engagement with the customer.FDC has acquired companies to promote flexibility for consumers and merchants and provides value-add for merchants. FDC made an offer to buy Acculynk in March, 2017 and subsequently closed later that year. Acculynk helps merchants lower their cost of acceptance. Debit payments are routed through the most cost-effective available debit network. This acquisition will not move the needle for FDC in the near-term and is considered a tuck-in acquisition. Another acquisition is BluePay (Oct, 2017) and it provides technology-enabled payment processing for merchants in the U.S. and Canada. It was one of the largest distribution partners of FDC and focuses on card-not-present transactions. BluePay is fairly large with $19Bn in annual volume with more than 77M merchants. FDC made a transformational acquisition with CardConnect Corp in May, 2017. CardConnect was one of FD's largest distribution partners, processing $26Bn of volume annually with 67M merchant customers. It provides processing and technology solutions including, CardPointe. CardConnect was a publicly-traded company with $589M in revenue and an operating loss of $12MM in FY16. The operating loss was largely related to the increase in costs associated with recent acquisitions.There was a lot of money spent on acquisitions over the last two years ($848MM over the last twelve months) and debt was partially used to finance the acquisitions. Debt was an issue in the past, but it being managed by both refinancing and pushing out the maturity and through pay down. Currently, FDC does not pay a divide or buy back stock. Total gross debt has declined ~$238MM between 9/30/16 and 9/30/17.There are no major maturities till 2020, thus providing flexibility to how to use cash.Any excess cash flow can be used to pay down debt (if allowed per the agreements or if feasible), plow into development or make acquisitions. Another reason why FDC's stock has not performed in-line to their peers is the less than desirable operating performance. There has been revenue growth, but it was not worth paying up for.FY16 was the first year that there was profit recorded on the income statement. FY15 looks bad, but there were several one-time items, including a $100MM expense to terminate the management expense with KKR.Even with the less than stellar net profit number, FDC was cash flow positive, thus demonstrating good operating performance.Management has spent time to improve operations and focus on higher-margin products. Over the last year, management has noted several large and significant deal wins.The deal wins and growth in enterprise services are great and are good for projecting near-term revenue growth. FDC also has been performing well with good organic growth. For the most part, YTD17 has been better than YTD16.Overall, GBS YTD17 revenue growth has been modest at three percent. The third quarter showed promise in the EMEA and LATAM segments. Improvement in those two segments were due to higher transaction growth in the U.K. and Germany, and Brazil and Argentina, respectively. Whereas, North America growth was supported by the CardConnect acquisition and demand for the Clover platform.The GFS segment is performing better with 5% growth YTD and for the last three months. EMEA and LATAM revenue expanse is due to growth in sales to existing and new clients largely throughout the region and benefit from the VisionPlus partnership. As we saw early the improvement in revenues has trickled down to EBITDA and to free cash flow. Management was guiding for ~$1Bn in FCF at the beginning of FY17 and by the 3rd quarter, management was guiding for over $1Bn in FCF. This demonstrates that they are executing on growth and operating leverage.Unadjusted FCF has improved each in the last two quarters and $153MM from 9/30/16. Total last twelve month FCF was $1.7Bn.FDC is the largest in relation to LTM revenue; however, its market cap is somewhat in the middle. All of the competitors have stronger revenue growth, with SQ and Vantiv (VNTV) as the leaders (albeit a much smaller base). I like to think that Global Payments Inc (GPN) are close comparables in business segments and history. GPN had debt issues in the past, but it was always promoted as a turnaround story and shareholders have been rewarded and FDC could do the same thing. It is understandable why FDC's valuation is lower than its peers. I believe the current valuation is too harsh. Yes, revenue growth, operating metrics and EPS are lower than its peers, but its recent performance and near-term outlook are not baked in. Management has guided for revenue growth of ~3%-5% (improved from recent historical performance) in FY17, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 5%-7% and adjusted EPS of ~15%. Much of the improvement in cash flow will come from winning higher margin enterprise deals. With the recent acquisitions (that appear good now), improvement in cash flow and capital position a higher PE is warranted. I think a PE of at least 15 is warranted. The average analyst EPS is $1.53 for FY18, with a 15 multiple, the price target is ~$23.There are many tailwinds for FDC, including improved revenue growth and operating leverage, shift towards digitization of transactions and use of credit/debit cards and focus on growth in Europe and LATAM. FDC has been undervalued to its peers for seemingly the right reasons. FDC is better managed now and has improved and their is a road map to improve operations and cash flow further and this has not been realized by the investment community. Management has guided for stronger growth than it has traditionally experienced and FY17 could mark the second consecutive year of net profit. Multiple expansion is warranted and when its peers become too expensive, FDC will be a good alternative."

Fiserv did not file an 8-K, which would have been required if the amount of the transaction was material, and also did not provide any change in guidance, so it is likely that the transaction was not material to its financial condition.Fiserv is acquiring PCLender to provide a simpler, online-based interface for its small- and medium-sized client base.As Fiserv stated in the deal announcement,The deal will serve to enhance Fiserv’s existing mortgage origination service suite of offerings by providing an online-based system for those clients wishing to take advantage of compliant, cloud-based systems that promise to reduce the costs of on-premise systems requiring greater IT management resources.Fiserv is betting on a continued trend in middle-market and small enterprises, that of transitioning from legacy, on-premises systems to cloud-based systems.These medium and smaller customers also value ease of use and simplicity, as younger, digitally-native employees move into positions of influence over IT and software decision-making.So, in my view, Fiserv management is making the right moves to bring in-house a simpler, cloud-based solution that promises to be more relevant to evolving market demands.Although it’s not a large deal, it still sends a signal that Fiserv management is staying on top of current trends and acquiring assets to take advantage of those opportunities.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups and IPOs.

Morgan, HSBC, SMBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, AIB, BMO, ING and others.The only disclosed financing round was a private equity funding in September 2011 from ViewPoint Capital Partners.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms. Fiserv did not file an 8-K, which would have been required if the transaction had resulted in a material change in financial condition.FISV management also did not provide any change to financial guidance as a result of the transaction, so I presume the deal was done for a non-material amount.Fiserv is acquiring Dovetail due to its capabilities to assist financial institutions with outdated, legacy processing systems to modernize their payments infrastructure within a more unified system.Fiserv will also combine Dovetail’s system with its existing ACH processing solution to process transactions in the US and in SWIFT in Europe. The combined system will be available as an on-premise solution or deployed as a cloud-based service.As the firm stated in the deal announcement,Fiserv hopes to use the deal to expand its European footprint due to Dovetail’s strong presence in the EU.The firm has been acquisitive in recent quarters, having acquired six companies, including Dovetail, in the past 20 months.(Source: Crunchbase)The acquisition activity shows that management is aggressively adding capabilities in response to a changing financial services environment within national and international banking systems.I foresee continued disruption and change in the financial services industry, likely for decades to come, and financial institutions will need to continue modernizing their systems to appeal to new generations of users who want new, real-time service offerings.Fiserv management appears to be taking the necessary aggressive steps to provide their customers and prospects with transitional technologies to stay competitive.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

4209205,104439,2018-10-01T14:19:16-04:00,"Fiserv has a comprehensive coverage for account and payment processing systems.A wide range of institutions use Fiserv's products for their core business.Comparison between industry and Fiserv's fundamentals show that the firm has outperformed in many cases.My DCF valuation indicates that the firm is correctly priced, while relative value shows mixed results.","Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) is a fintech firm specializing in account processing systems, payment processing products and services in electronic, mobile, internet and card arena, and check processing and risk management tools. The firm’s customers include banks, savings banks, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, billers, retailers, merchants, and building societies. In its latest quarter, Fiserv posted 2% quarterly growth compared to the same quarter the previous year, with 7 percent growth in the payments segment and 5 percent decline in the financial segment. For the first six months of 2018, GAAP revenue increased 3 percent to $2.86 billion compared to the prior-year period, with 7 percent growth in the payments segment and 3 percent decline in the financial segment. In order to value Fiserv, I have used a DCF model and a relative value model. My DCF model suggests that Fiserv is correctly priced at $83, but relative value shows mixed results. Combining all the factors, Fiserv is a buy.Source: Data from StockrowFiserv has maintained an average gross margin of 44% for last five years, with 26% average in EBIT margin, 16% in profit margin and 19% in FCF margin for the same period. To put things into perspective, I have computed industry average benchmarks and Fiserv has outperformed many of its peers on the basis of a multitude of indicators. The peers include Fidelity National (FIS), Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY), Global Payments (GPN), Worldpay (WP) and Intuit (INTU). Although average gross margins were lower than the industry average, operating margin, net income margin and FCF margin have been higher than the industry average consistently.Source: Data from Stockrow, calculations by the authorOn the other hand, debt has been increasingly funding a large portion of the asset base compared to the peers. But so far the debt growth has not been problematic at all for Fiserv, as indicated by its superior bottom lines and yearly operating cash flows of more than a billion dollars for the last five years. As of December 2017, the firm has had $4.9 billion in total debt.Fiserv’s sales pipeline under DNA (account processing system, acquired in 2013) is rapidly growing. In its latest quarter, Fiserv has added 11 clients to go live on DNA in the quarter and the firm expects nearly 30 to go live for the year, roughly half of which are institutions with assets over $1 billion. The firm is also gaining momentum in its digital channel payment processing; Mobiliti (digital sales processing system) has featured 24% growth in its subscriber base, reaching over 7.5 million in absolute numbers. Fiserv expects to have more than 300 clients in production this year which represents roughly a sixfold increase for the year. Fiserv’s electronic payment processing product Zelle is gaining momentum too; Zelle transactions in the quarter were up more than 40% sequentially, and through June 30 were up more than 15 times the prior year's level. Its latest addition under BillMatrix (enables a variety of health payment options across multiple platforms and channels) is Blue Shield of California, one of the largest blue plans in the United States.Fiserv is exposed to interest rate risk and market price risk through its outstanding debt, investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency. The firm manages its debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt. Based on its outstanding debt with variable interest rates at December 31, 2017, the firm estimates that a 1% increase in its borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in 2018 by approximately $16 million. On the other hand, while processing electronic payment transactions, the firm invests funds received from its subscribers into short-term, highly liquid investments. Fiserv estimates that a 1% increase or decrease in applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on its annual income from continuing operations. Fiserv has foreign operations which exposes it to currency exchange risk; as of December 31, 2017, the firm entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with notional value of approximately $150 million. Fiserv estimates that a 10% adverse move as of December 31, 2017, would not materially impact its annual income from continuing operations or financial position.My DCF model indicates that Fiserv’s intrinsic value is approximately $83, indicating that the firm is correctly priced in the market. In order to compute Fiserv’s intrinsic value, I have made a number of assumptions. Initial revenue growth is taken to be 5%, which is 50 bps higher than the firm’s lower guidance. Cost of sales, selling expenditures, income tax expense and capital expenditures are all assumed to be close to the long-term historical averages. Weighted average cost of capital is assumed to be 10.78% and exit multiple (EV/EBITDA) is taken to 22x, which I think is fair for a fintech firm from a selling perspective. On the other hand, relative value shows mixed results. P/E and EV/EBITDA indicate that Fiserv is undervalued, while P/B shows that the firm is slightly overvalued.Source: Data from Stockrow, projections by the author (can be found in the notes section)Source: Seeking AlphaA substantial portion of Fiserv’s sales is generated from institutional customers, which ensures that Fiserv has a high degree of product reliability. This is also reflected in the top notch fundamentals the firm has demonstrated over a good period of time, both in top and bottom lines. Growth driven by account processing systems and electronic and mobile payment systems have been impressive, with rapid customer additions every quarter. Combining all the factors, Fiserv is a buy.Notes*The following table shows forecast inputs and implied margins as a result of the forecast.

(NASDAQ: TSLA); people have no time to waste and lag has become the biggest inconvenience for all. The payment industry has adopted this tendency of immediacy only in recent years, and only after the arrival of FinTechs, cashless payments and virtual terminals that have changed the consumer behavior forever and now they don’t have time to wait for their money to be settled.According to a study from BI Intelligence, $503 billion in payment volume could be recorded in 2020 from in-store mobile, as online shopping becomes more common. This trend is creating new winners and losers in the payment industry while small businesses and merchants are trying to shift to a digital offering. Retailers are adopting new transaction methods to adapt to their customer preferences and needs, in an effort to countermeasure the increasing surge of small e-commerce and the overwhelming competition of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The payment processors and acquirers now have to offer more than just the transaction and settlement process, their customers are now demanding speed, efficiency and security.As one participant in the payment processing industry, First Data Corporation (NYSE:FDC) provides commerce-enabling technology and solutions for merchants, financial institutions and card issuers. The main source of revenue comes from its global business solutions (GBS), which includes retail point of sale (POS) for merchant and also e-commerce services.First Data is better known for its cloud-based “Clover” mobile point of sale that is lagging behind similar products from more specialized companies like Square (NYSE:SQ) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). Due to this, revenue growth hasn’t been exceptional over the past years, and is barely above the inflation rate, with a modest growth of 2% annually for the past 5 years.Source: Information extracted using data from the SEC.Recently, First Data announced the acquisition of CardConnect, a long-time distribution partner, for approximately $750 million, as an effort to boost the global business solutions. This acquisition could represent an increase of volume processes payment of $26 billion annually as CardConnect portfolio of clients comprehends about 67,000 merchant customers. Executives are being really optimistic about the acquisition, and continue with their initiatives of developing the e-commerce products and maintaining the company's independent software vendors (ISV) partnerships.In a similar way, Vantiv, Inc. (NYSE:VNTV) is helping merchants to meet their payment processing needs. The company enables its customers to accept and process credit, debit and prepaid payments; it also offers added services such as security solutions and fraud management. Its major source of revenue comes from the merchant services segment, which authorizes, clears, settles and provides reporting of electronic payment transactions originated at the point of sale as well as e-commerce and mobile transactions.The merchant services segment has reported strong growth over the past years, driven in part from large retail chains and from the increasing momentum in the e-commerce, as customers increasingly prefer to shop online.Source: Information extracted using data from the SEC.A few days ago, Vantiv announced a deal to buy its British rival Worldpay Group PLC (WPG) for 8 billion pounds ($10.4 billion), in a bid to create a $29-billion global payments company. The reason for the deal seems to be to offset the “Amazon effect” as traditional businesses and retailers have suffered from the crushing competition of the giant tech, and the losses could potentially transfer to Vantiv.While the combined company will process $1.5 trillion in payments annually and 40 billion transactions when the deal is completed, the merger will take some time to see the synergies on track. Meanwhile, in the mid-term, it will cost approximately $330 million to combine the two companies. Nevertheless, the combined company will bring global exposure and value in the long term for investors, as both companies are currently reporting double-digit growth.At this time, First Data and Vantiv have about the same market cap. The present article has the intention to lay the groundwork before these companies have a rapid change in valuation, by offering a snapshot of the companies before the acquisition events.Source: Information extracted using data from the SEC.First Data's margins have remained practically unchanged over the past 5 years, which speaks about the fixed cost structure and the management commitment to generate returns which are improving from the negative levels reported in previous quarters.The company seems to be more focused on improving its EBITDA and free cash flow levels, rather than increase the growth rates, as executives continue the cost discipline and proactive balance sheet management. As a result, it has reported an early recovery, since the second quarter of 2017 has delivered better-than-expected results, which could boost the profits for the fiscal year ended while the company prepares for the fourth quarter which is typically First Data's seasonally strongest quarter.In a similar way, Vantiv's margins and returns have been also constant and reliable over the past years, although enhanced lightly over time due to an increase in leverage. While in the long term, the margins for the combined company between Vantiv and Worldpay will improve due to harmonizing the company's platforms and from streamlining corporate costs, in the short term, executives are expecting to incur a restructuring cost of $330 million after the completion of the merger.Additionally, although the margins of Worldpay look inferior when compared to Vantiv's, its debt levels and leverage are much lower. Moreover, Vantiv will benefit from the capital expenditure investments made by Worldpay last year, in addition to potential capitalized R&D investment.Source: Information extracted using data from the SEC.Extending the return analysis over two years, while the ROIC seems to be at similar levels between the two companies, Vantiv presents a better asset turnover ratio compared to First Data that is boosting its ROIC through a higher tax burden due to its equity earnings in affiliates, rather than improving the EBIT margin or the asset turnover.Also, First Data presents higher levels of financial leverage compared to Vantiv, their ratio of financial debt compared to EBITDA is 8.52x and 4.46x, respectively, and the debt to equity ratio is 6.34x to 3.54x, respectively.Since First Data started trading, the price has been underperforming the market as it has risen a 16%, while the S&P has increased 17%. On the other hand, Vantiv's stock price has surged 60% over the same period, outperforming the S&P by more than 40%. The constant revenue growth is supporting the appreciation of the stock price of Vantiv, while in the case of First Data, the slow increase of the price in recent quarters is based on the positive shift in net earnings.VNTV data by YChartsThe growth of Vantiv is being driven by the recent insertion into the small and mid-sized merchants that are contributing to a higher net revenue per transaction. Furthermore, future growth could be sustained if Vantiv keeps switching to new e-commerce merchants and continues expanding its global presence through the Worldpay acquisition.For First Data, executives are expecting revenue growth in the range of 3-5% by full-year 2017, on a constant currency basis, an increase that will be aligned with its historical growth. It looks like the company is still waiting for its global business solutions to take off, while trying to retain its customers of its integrated POS product “Clover” and continue to expand its equity earnings in affiliates.Source: Information extracted from the SEC and calculated using price data from Google.Overall, the valuation for First Data seems to be slightly above the market mean, but still below the IT services Industry (GICS®), and it is supported by margins and free cash flow levels instead of revenue growth. The price would continue to underperform since there is no near-term catalyst for the company. As an alternative, a buyback program could be authorized as a way of returning capital to shareholders and maintaining an investment thesis, but for now this is not the case.In the case of Vantiv, investors should stay cautious about the change in valuations after the merger, as the deal to buy Worldpay will come with a high premium and together with a dilution effect. This could put more pressure over the price if future revenue growth doesn’t beat expectations, even though the combined company continues to report double-digit growth."

Fiserv also generated $463 million in cash flow from operations for 1Q 2017. (Unaudited)The back story on the deal is a cautionary tale of technology startups working with corporate investors that change their priorities. In this case, Monitise’s investor Visa had backed the company which enabled it to parlay that support into signing up most of the major British retail bank brands.In 2014, however, Visa pulled the rug from Monitise by declaring it would build its own mobile payments system. It sold its shares in the company and Monitise’s stock, which had reached a high of GBP 79.25 in March 2014, began a precipitous fall to its current $2.83.The ensuing lack of support from its most visible investor also hampered Monitise’s ability to retain and attract new banking clients.Enter Fiserv, who hopes to utilize Monitise’s FINkit software and combine it with its existing suite of technology to expand its offerings to clients.As Fiserv stated in the deal announcement,So, the deal is essentially a $90 million ‘team and tech’ acquisition for the FINkit system.As an FT article on the deal stated, ‘Peter Roe, an analyst with TechMarketView, said Monitise’s technology was sound, but the “toxic history of the Monitise brand” had stalled its progress.’Hopefully, Fiserv can use that ‘sound’ technology to its benefit over the long-term.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4076781,103066,2017-05-26T07:41:16-04:00,"FDC is experiencing favorable ratings by independent research analysts, and I wanted to take a closer look at owning it.I have been researching FDC for quite some time as a potential suitor to acquire a company of which I am a significant shareholder.I believe analysts' price targets are conservative, and believe FDC could run to $22 over the next 12 to 18 months.The options market gives us some favorable strategies for selling calls against a long position, or selling puts to potentially open a position. I'll give you specifics.","My conversation regarding First Data Corp. (FDC) must begin with additional disclosure to the typical disclosures posted at the bottom of this article. I am familiar with FDC, and specifically their GBS unit, because I was previously a part of a team that tried, and continues to actively try, to create a business relationship with one of my significant private holdings.Furthermore, I am of the position that the company I have equity interest in could be a solid strategic acquisition for FDC, and will likely continue to have these conversations amongst various parties, including FDC, in the future.To be sure, there really is no personal agenda in rating FDC shares favorable or unfavorable. And there is no personal benefit I would receive in doing so.But because I've been impressed with their leadership and the company overall, both when they were privately held and since they've gone public, for my family portfolios I started buying FDC this week.First Data CorporationFDC is a Mid Cap ($6.3 billion) in the Information Technology industry, with a P/E of 29.95 on trailing twelve month earnings.The company is a global leader in electronic commerce, and offers a wide array of integrated products from next-generation commerce technologies to merchant acquiring, from issuing to network solutions. FDC operates across three business segments: Global Business Solutions (GBS), Global Financial Solutions (GFS), and Network & Security Solutions.GBS provides retail point-of-sale (POS) merchant acquiring and eCommerce services as well as next-generation offerings, and cloud-based Clover POS operating system.GFS provides credit and retail private-label card processing, as well as licensed financial software systems, and lending solutions.Network & Security Solutions provides electronic funds transfer network solutions, debt card processing solutions stored value network solutions, and security and fraud solutions.FDC operates in 118 countries worldwide, reaching approximately six million business locations over the course of a year and more than 4,000 financial institutions.After American Express spun off FDC in 1992 through an IPO, they were taken private in 2007 by private equity firm KKR. In October 2015, FDC officially went public again, and used a large majority of IPO proceeds to pay down debt.FDC has made several accretive acquisitions over the past five years, including 1) Clover (December 2012), which has been expanded to a full platform of commerce solutions, 2) Perka (October 2013), a mobile marketing and consumer loyalty platform, 3) Gyft (August 2014), a digital platform that enables consumers to buy, send, manage, and redeem gift cards using mobile devices, and 4) Transaction Wireless (June 2015), a provider of digital stored value products (gift card programs, loyalty incentives, and integrated marketing solutions for retailers, partners and consumers).In 2015, FDC processed 79 billion transactions globally, or more than 28% of the world's eCommerce volume.FDC has significant leverage of $18 billion, according to Barron's in their May 22, 2017 article ""Up 44%, First Data Can Post Another 25% in Gains."" Furthermore, in their latest report (May 8, 2017), Credit Suisse states that FDC improved their interest terms by at least 50 bps.This debt measures against a market cap of $6.3 billion with a $429 million cash balance. At the beginning of the year, FDC had $19.6 billion of debt, so CEO Bisignano, who joined the company in 2013, has clearly been chipping away at the debt. With nearly $1.5 billion in 2018 EPS, we expect their debt burden to be manageable, though it will hinder the board from possible other major strategic acquisitions or declaring a dividend.I'll focus on 1) their ability to grow EPS consistently and in line with their estimates, and 2) their de-leveraging efforts. To be sure, from the sounds of it, so is CEO Bisignano. He told Barron's last week:CFRA analyst David Holt raise his 2018 earnings estimates to $1.63, and increased his 12-month price target for FDC shares by $1, to $19.Furthermore, he gives insight into his view on the industry as a whole, stating that FDC is a best-of-breed player here.Credit Suisse analysts Paul Condra and Mrinalini Bhutoria follow FDC, and recently wrote that they continue to grow confidence in FDC's ability to predict and meet future earnings.Less enthusiastic Ford Research provides a hold rating in its most recent update, dated May 19, 2017:And though I usually stay out of the technicals of an issue, I rely on MarketEdge to make me feel great about the quantitative issues with FDC:According to FDC's Jaywalk Consensus report, last updated May 10, 2017, ten independent analysts follow FDC and give it the following ratings: five rate it a strong buy or buy, four rate it a hold, and one rates it a sell or strong sell.And on CEO Bisignano, Jack Willoughby refers to Barron's earlier call on May 21, 2016, in last weekend's edition:FDC OptionsFDC is a good candidate for a covered call strategy. If you are an advocate for selling call options against long stock positions, then you may be able to create your own ""dividend"" by selling call options against it.I realize there are many perma-bulls in the Seeking Alpha community, but this call option strategy provides additional income while waiting for upside growth. This additional income can be considered a nice hedge to the bull thesis. To be sure, I own FDC long in my portfolio, uncovered, and I cover a long position in my retired mother's portfolio.Buying FDC around $16.90 today, and selling the $18 July Call would provide about $0.20 in premium, or 1.2%, and 6.5% over FDC's current trading levels. Not entirely breathtaking, but over a year I think this will equate to 6% to 8% of call option premium.Not all that sold on the FDC long thesis? A covered call strategy that is less bullish, and more focused on a hedge, may work well especially in tax advantaged portfolios like IRAs, if you can trade options.For example, as of the time of this writing, I can sell July $17 Call options against FDC for about $0.55, providing 3.25% of premium compared to FDC stock price, but only allowing half a percent to the upside.Want a more aggressive hedge to your FDC position? I like the October $16 Call option for about $1.75. This will provide a 10% hedge while limiting your upside to about 5% over the next five months.My ConclusionIn my continued work to double my family's wealth as many times as possible, in the time I have to do it, I tend to look for predictable ways for my portfolio to grow and to beat the market. Using call options against stocks may not beat the market when the market is providing extremely positive returns. But in average bull markets, sideways markets, and bearish markets, selling call options against stocks I love has consistently allowed me to beat the market, and work towards doubling my family wealth every three to five years.I love FDC from here. Even keeping a multiple discount to its peers of 15 (peers trade at 19+), I see visibility to FDC shares at $22, which is more aggressive than other analysts' targets, which range from $17 to $20.My bullish thesis is more based on what we know - which FDC meeting their numbers over the next 12 to 18 months, while reducing company debt. But new business and reducing churn in their consumer products will provide potential upside that isn't accounted for in this report.FDC signed a new agreement with Jack Henry to process debit and credit card transaction and Jack Henry will become a referral partner for the Star Network. In addition, FDC expanded its relationship with First Citizens Bank, started processing installment loans for Barclays, started processing loans for Citizen's Bank, expanded its McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) partnership by enabling mobile orders ahead, and are working with Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) on their mobile payment strategy. FDC also won a new deal to enable payments for a large e-commerce customer.FDC is a great way to make a conservative play in the technology sector, and the options market allows us to add juice in our portfolio in the form of premium received.Not sure you want to own it here, but like it better at $15 or $16/share (and not worried about missing out on upside with this issue)?If I liked it better at $16/share, I might sell the July $16 put options for around $0.25.To be sure, I DO like owning more at $15/share, and don't believe the bull thesis will materially change over the next few months. Tomorrow or Monday, I will likely sell the October $15 puts for around $0.50 each, or about 3% of the underlying stock price. If it continues to run or stays flat, I'll just keep that 3% premium. If it goes down, I wouldn't mind owning more.Weekly NewsletterI endeavor to double my money as many times as possible, in the time I have to do it. For me, this means consistently finding winners,working with options to add juice to my portfolios, and keeping a focus on concentrated diversification.

So, it is likely the company will fund most of the transaction through adding to its high debt.First Data is operating cash flow positive, with its most recent quarter adding $421 million in CFFO (Cash Flow From Operations), so it appears the company can pay for the deal.Management says its ‘medium-term deleveraging objective remains intact.’Since CardConnect is currently showing a 2017 revenue run rate of $626 million, First Data is paying approximately a 1.2x Price/Sales multiple, which although is a 10% premium to CCN’s recent stock price is somewhat low when compared to a basket of non-bank financial firms revenue multiples. (Source: NYU Stern)As a result, I wonder if other payment processors will want to jump in and increase the bid for CCN.According to the deal announcement, the transaction is expected to be ‘modestly accretive to First Data’s adjusted EPS [Non-GAAP] in the first full year post-closing, before expected synergies.’Essentially, First Data is adding volume to its platform. CardConnect brings 67,000 merchants and $26 billion to First Data’s system and was already a distribution partner with First Data, so the two companies were previously familiar with working together.Integration risk should be minimal as a result of this previous working relationship.Another important addition for First Data is CCN’s invoice-to-cash processing capabilities in the enterprise/ERP space.This area is one in which numerous technology startups are focused intently on and represents a very large market opportunity as middle-market companies transaction their operations to the cloud from on-premises and legacy systems.In addition, CardConnect’s API approach will give First Data an entrée into distributed tools for connecting enterprise clients and their vendor ecosystems while retaining a piece of the transaction volume.For CardConnect, it will obtain access to First Data’s customer base to take advantage of cross-selling and upselling opportunities across a much larger distribution footprint.Assuming First Data can close the deal without another suitor coming in to bid up the price, the acquisition looks to be a potential win for FDC.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

(FDC) was back in October 2016. Since then, the stock has appreciated about 20%. The latest quarterly earnings report is out, and it shows solid progress in First Data's turnaround. The good news for investors is that the stock is still underappreciated, undervalued, and poised to go much higher from this level.Stock still significantly undervaluedCompany management projected a 15% increase in adjusted EPS in 2017 at the Annual Investor Meeting last November, and confirmed that guidance in the latest earnings call. However, even after such upbeat forecast, the market appears to be anything but enthusiastic about FDC stock.*2017 First Data guidance, Source: First Data 2016 Investor ConferenceTo see how much undervalued the stock still is, look no further than this comparison:*All forward earnings/share data are from respective companies' 2017 guidance. Prices are from February 13, 2017. S&P 500 forward P/E is from WSJ.As we can see, First Data trades at a significantly lower forward P/E than both its peers and the S&P 500 average.Turnaround on track1. Debt Refinance and Debt PaydownFirst Data did several re-financing deals in Q4 last year, reducing by 10% the total interests it will have to pay annually in the future. In 2016, the company used the majority of its free cash flow to pay down its debt, reducing the total debt load by $1.1 billion.*Debt refinancing reduces interest expenses by $100 million+, and 70% of gross debt is either fixed or hedged. Source: First Data 2016 Q4 earnings presentation.*Paid down over $1.1 billion of debt in 2016. Source: First Data 2016 Q4 earnings presentation.Reduced debt load and lower interest rates from re-financed loans will shave interest expenses by more than $100 million in 2017. In addition, it is almost certain that First Data will keep deleveraging its balance sheet - an act that will even further reduce its interest expenses. The interest expense savings alone will boost First Data's 2017 EPS by more than 10 cents a share. If the company can hit its 2017 revenue growth target and EBITDA growth target, it will have a very good chance of reaching or even exceeding its 15% EPS growth goal.2017 estimated earnings/share generated from interest expense reduction:*Except per share number and tax rate, all figures are in millions*If we assume a linear deleveraging of $1 billion of debt over the year of 2017 and apply an average debt cost of 4.5%, we get roughly 22.5 million annual savings this year. The diluted shares count is from the company's 2016 Q4 earnings release.By keeping paying down its debt with its strong cash flow, First Data forecasts the leverage ratio will fall to around 4 in 2019 - a number that is very close to the industry average.*Management is determined to lower the leverage ratio to the industry average by 2019. Source: 2016 FDC Investor Day Presentation2. Improved Business ResultsFDC's 2016 results show solid improvement compared to the 2015 numbers. On a constant currency basis, total segment revenue increased by 4%, while total segment expenses decreased by 1%. The company's EBITDA margin improved by 180 basis points and EBITDA increased by 9%. As a result, adjusted net income doubled from 2015.*Adjusted net income doubled in 2016. Source: First Data 2016 Q4 earnings presentation.The results of Global Financial Solutions (GFS) division are especially worthy of praise. Since CEO Frank Bisignano took over, he quickly turned this division from one losing clients to one winning new contracts. In 2016, GFS' revenues rose 10% and EBITDA jumped 21%. Since the client onboarding process takes several months after initial contract wins, some of the new contracts signed in 2016 have yet to materialize into sales. However, with a strong pipeline, First Data's GFS segment should witness continued healthy growth in 2017.Global Business Solutions (NASDAQ:GBS) did not improve as much as the GFS division did: GBS' revenues climbed 2% and EBITDA grew 6%. However, the segment's results are still rather encouraging. First, management thinks that Clover, the company's next-generation POS system, is getting good traction, and therefore, will start publishing Clover sales numbers in 2017. If the system indeed performs well in the future, it will boost this division's results nicely. Second, there is continued improvement in First Data's small business customer churn rate. This declined by 100 basis points in Q3 2016 and declined another 100 basis points in Q4. Third, the company's Latin America business is on fire. Revenue in Q4 grew 45% compared to last year, driven by Brazil and Argentina.*The GFS segment is performing nicely, and other divisions are improving as well. Source: First Data 2016 Q4 earnings presentation.SummaryFirst Data is clearly turning around, and its business fundamentals should keep improving. FDC continues to be a cheap stock in a fairly valued market. A fair valuation of the stock should assign a forward P/E multiple of 16-17 - I don't see any reason why it should not trade close to the S&P 500 forward P/E. A 16-17 forward P/E multiple implies this stock can rise another 50% from the current level.I recommend investors to take a position in First Data Corp. and hold the stock for the long term."
4031623,24262,2016-12-20T07:19:28-05:00,,"By Dean PopplewellTuesday December 20: Five things the markets are talking aboutVolatility across regional indices and major currency pairs remains seasonably compressed despite the geopolitical nerves in Europe.Sovereign debt saw a relatively strong bid over the last session on heightened geopolitical risk – a Russian ambassador was shot and killed by an off-duty policeman in Turkey in defiance of Russia’s involvement in the Syria conflict. In Germany, a suspect terror attack, reminiscent of the Nice France truck attack (July, 2016), has left at least a dozen dead, while in Switzerland a lone gunman was shot and killed after an attack on a Mosque in Zurich.The yen, one of the go-to currencies of choice during risk aversion, has fallen outright overnight (¥118.01) ahead of the US open after the BoJ, last of the Tier I central banks, held policy steady, shedding some gains made following the European attacks.1. Global bourses edge higher despite political risks A positive outlook on the economies of the US, Germany and Japan has helped global indices to look beyond Europe’s geopolitical risks.With Fed Chair Yellen’s speech Monday rather bullish – the US to grow strongly – has led to a return of the risk-on trade in the market overnight despite the terror attacks over the past 24-hours.In Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average closed up +0.5%. The Aussies ASX 200 closed out +0.5%, while Korea’s Kospi added +0.2%. The outlier was Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index losing -0.6%.In Europe, equity indices are trading higher, consolidating around last week's rally highs ahead of the US open. Financial stocks are leading the gains, while energy, commodity and mining stocks are trading generally lower.US futures are set to open in the black.Indices: Stoxx50 +0.3% at 3,265, FTSE -0.1% at 7,009, DAX flat at 11,423, CAC-40 +0.3% at 4,836, IBEX-35 +0.4% at 9,373, FTSE MIB +0.7% at 19,093, SMI +0.3% at 8,261, S&P 500 Futures +0.1%2. Crude prices under pressure on position paringOil prices have eased as investors and dealers unwind positions in the run-up to the holiday season.Brent futures fell -0.2% to trade at +$54.81, while US light crude (WTI) slid -0.4% to +$51.91 per barrel.With no fundamentals available to drive large price swings, both investors and dealers should expect the remainder of this week to be rather tepid.The future direction of oil prices depends on OPEC’s and non-member compliance to last month’s agreement to a cut in global production. Producers are expected to adhere to a cut of almost +1.8m bpd in oil output from January 1.Safe haven gold, which rallied +0.4% yesterday, has pulled back -0.3% overnight to +$1,135.06 an ounce, as the prospect of further US rate hikes outweigh political concerns.3. Global yields “too and fro”Yesterday, sovereign yields fell after the biggest six-week sell-off in more than seven-years pushed yields higher. Geopolitical news added to the demand for haven bonds.Overnight, the US 10-year note yield has backed up to +2.574% from +2.544% Monday, when it declined for the first time in eight-days. German bund yields have inched up to +0.264% from +0.255%, while Italian yields have jumped to +1.880% from +1.822%.Also this morning, the Italian government has requested parliamentary permission to issue up to +€20B in additional debt, setting up a possible move to help its troubled banking sector.4. Dollar shrugs off Euro terror risksThe ‘mighty’ dollar has maintained its firm tone ahead of the US open mostly supported by Fed Chair Yellen’s comments yesterday where she observed the US jobs market being its strongest in nearly a decade and that economic gains were finally raising most living standards.USD/JPY is up +0.76% at ¥118.01, with the yen falling after the BoJ retained its ultra accommodative monetary policy. Governor Kuroda also highlighted the benefits of a weaker yen to Japan’s economy. Expect the market to focus on last week’s multi-month peak of around ¥118.65 for conviction of a sustained dollar rally.Elsewhere, Europe’s single unit, the EUR, is down -0.15% at €1.0384, nearing last week’s low of €1.0365, while the UK pound is down -0.3% at £1.2350.5. No holiday shock from the BoJ There were no surprises from the BoJ overnight which kept its policy steady for Interest Rates (NIRP), QQE and Yield Control (YCC) – short-term IOER (interest on excess reserves) was left at -0.1% while the target rate on the 10-year JGB’s was kept at around 0% despite a minority view that it could be raised to reflect the recent jump in global yields and lower rates.Also as speculated in the Japanese press, the BoJ raised its assessment for overall economy as well as the Exports component, noting continued moderate recovery trend (prior acknowledged sluggishness) and a pick-up in shipments.Japanese inflation expectations are still deemed to be in “weakening phase”, and the outlook for inflation remains to be slightly negative or about 0% due to effects of decline in global energy prices.BoJ also noted that the overall forex trend was one of stronger USD, not yen weakness. Policy makers do not believe that their domestic currency had excessively weakened (only at levels from earlier this year).Note: Since the US election the yen is down -12% outright.This article is for general information purposes only.

3987420,98236,2016-07-11T00:57:46-04:00,"Fiserv and FIS are two analog competitors in the FinTech space with remarkably similar fundamentals and relative valuation.Fiserv has the advantage in organic growth and profitability and its valuation almost exactly reflects that advantage.For some years now, growth in operating metrics has lagged growth in share price.The company's focus areas of growth including payments and mobile have been enough to drive mid-single digits organic top-line growth.The company's operating performance has been marked by steady, sustained growth in profitability and operating cash flow.","Does it matter much that FISV is #2 in its space?Simply put, there have been no signs in terms of operating metrics that the dethronement of Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) as the leading player by size in the FinTech space has done anything to slow its momentum. It still retains its crown as the leading supplier of core technology to the space and there is little to suggest that will change in the foreseeable future.Size can matter in the financial services industry software space. But in this case, being dethroned as the king-pin of FinTech when competitor Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) purchased SunGuard a few months ago hasn't mattered a great deal in terms of the competition between the two vendors. It is hard to keep a scorecard on competition amongst core banking platforms and since we are investors here and not analysts of bank software, it really doesn't matter a great deal. The large vendors have several solutions in the same space with different names and apparently somewhat different functionality. One blog that attempts to put the market space in some perspective carries the engaging name of VendorDirt. No, don't all try to open the site simultaneously, there are no steamy pictures or even mysterious confessions. The site calls itself a collection of observations, ruminations, prediction and random thoughts focused on the FinTech space. Its online publication is composed by a group of consultants who specialize in banking software.Its latest overview article starts off by comparing core vendors (of bank software) to blind dates. ""You envision a gorgeous, funny and smart mystery person but really you just hope your date's visible scables scarring is minimal and you don't end up hog-tied in the back of a creepy panel van. We all have high hopes for our blind dates but we have to be realistic, too.""Usually in writing these articles, I try to find some kind of differentiation - be it strategy, product, support - something to distinguish the leading vendors. There are some differences to be sure between FIS and FISV. Fiserv is located in the suburbs of Milwaukee, some 908 miles from here. FIS is located in the heart of Jacksonville, FL, 960 miles from here, but in a different direction. I think I would take Florida over Wisconsin almost all of the time.A substantive difference is that Fiserv with 22,000 employees is expected to generate about $5.6 billion of revenue. FIS is forecast to generate $9.6 billion of revenues with 55,000 employees. That results in a rather significant difference in revenue per employee in favor of FISV ($254,000 vs. $175,000). Given that the primary cost of a services company is personnel, the core profitability of Fiserv will ultimately be greater than its competitor and that is exactly the case. I will take a deeper dive into what appears to be an anomaly as well as do some quick financial comparisons of this company and its rival FIS later in this article.But for now, I will just comment that VendorDirt rates the core solutions from both vendors as pretty good. Fiserv, which has 3 core solutions is said to have the most rounded suite within the industry. Fiserv has a strong position in the credit union space. And Fiserv is considered the vendor with the most tightly closed platform in the space - which wins them some vociferous and negative commentary. It is also said to have a woeful loan origination product. Who knew? Those faults haven't seemingly been a huge facto in the company operating results - maybe they would be better if they weren't closed, but percentage growth of the company's core platforms seems to be consistent with growth of the overall market.FIS is said to be struggling to establish a real identity with its suite of 3 core banking products. That doesn't mean that FIS has been unsuccessful in selling its 3 core banking platforms. It is the ancillary core banking platforms that are basically bought by smaller banks where FIS is said to have had problems.FIS is said to be nowhere in the credit union space and that is a reasonable conclusion when more than 80% share is divided between FISV and Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY). It is hard to compare CEOs. Inevitably, the CEO who has made the big transformative move, in this case Gary Norcross of FIS, gets most of articles written in recent months. FISV's CEO Jeff Yabuki is not quite as high profile in the industry although he has been CEO of Fiserv for more than a decade after coming from an executive role at H&R Block.(NYSE:HRB)But at the end of the day, the difference between the core banking technologies offered by the two large vendors doesn't appear to be great. Users are going to decide if one core platform or the other has specific features that suit their specific needs. They are going to decide based on their evaluation of other applications that sit on top of the core platform, they are going to decide based on the quality of the sales effort, and of course they are going to decide based on price.Overall, at this point in time, it appears that the organic revenue growth rate and the normalized earnings growth rate are more or less comparable, with a minor edge to FISV at this point. The major differences, when they occur, are a function of acquisitions. At the moment, the FIS acquisition of SunGuard stands out as having achieved significant accretion, but at the cost of a very levered balance sheet.Fiserv and FIS have remarkably similar levels of share price performance. Fiserv shares are up a heady 6.5X since the market lows in early March 2009. The shares have trebled in the past 5 years and are up 15% year to date. For some time now, with a few minor exceptions, it has been the space, i.e. FinTech and not the particular company that has been far more important in determining the change in share prices. That being said, as I observed in my recent article regarding FIS, woe to the share price of the company that disappoints headline expectations.Does any of the above suggest the need for readers to purchase the shares of either vendor at current levels? I really do not think so. There are many reasons for the performance of FinTech shares over the past 7 years. But the net effect has been to significantly increase valuation metrics. The space is not a high growth space, although almost all the revenues are recurring and hence very visible for both vendors. And, while organic growth is not at heady levels, acquisition targets have abounded and the targets have offered significant cost synergies and some revenue synergies. The EPS growth rate and the growth in cash flow for both vendors has been much more impressive than top line growth.But all of that is why the shares of both of these companies have appreciated and is not new news. That is one reason why the institutional ownership of Fiserv shares is 92%. There is nothing more than visibility, predictability and past appreciation that warm the heart of portfolio managers at large institutions who do not want to lose their job pursuing some contrarian home-run possibility and who need FinTech names to keep up with the competition.On the other hand, it is the reason why the consensus rating of 20 analysts who post their ratings is a hold and the mean price target is $102/share, 6% below the current price. And none of that reflects the industry concentration of this company which essentially sells to one vertical and that vertical has its own problems.CEO Jeffrey Yabuki commented that ""our results were somewhat slow, coming in at 70% of quota for the quarter."" This being the FinTech space with its seemingly unstoppable share price momentum that did nothing to really slow share price performance (the shares climbed 6% in the wake of the earnings release and they are up by 10% since May 5th.) Imagine what the impact would be if say Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) announced that its bookings had missed targets by 30% regardless of talking about growing pipelines and a forecast that ""we fully expect to reach our sales goals for the year."" Besides destroying lots of portfolios and marring the performance of many hedge funds, there would be an inevitable tendency to reassess the credibility of company management. But no matter.I think investors seeking alpha would be better served in another sector. I think that valuations are stretched. And I think the potential for Fiserv's customers to experience difficult times going forward is still under-appreciated. Fiserv is more than a decent company, but neither its valuation or macro trends are in its favor at this point.If I want FinTech which one do I pick?I am sorely tempted to reprise a comment I made on a similar subject in an earlier article, ""You pays yer money and you takes yer choice."" But since I used that in an earlier article, I am going to have to see if there are enough differences between the vendors in this space that might help investors make a rational choice.Fiserv is clearly the market leader in terms of its shore of core banking platforms. More than one-third of US banks uses one of the Fiserv core banking platforms. As I have commented in other articles in writing about the two other primary vendors in this space, the issue is that core banking platform revenues are only growing at 3.7%/year. There are very few new name banks or credit unions of size that actually need a new core banking platform. When one observer describes the choice of Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ:OZRK) as a great win for Fiserv Premier, it is a pretty sure sign that there simply aren't many other large opportunities about which to brag. The Bank of the Ozarks has an enterprise value of less than $3 billion and revenues this year are supposed to be just above $700 million.There are 4 vendors in the basic banking software space that divide up the market and have done so for years (Fiserv, FIS, Jack Henry and D+H/Harland in that order with D+H having most recently entered the U.S. market by buying Harland). So, to an extent, owning the largest share in the core space means having a better opportunity to sell additional products that are well integrated with the core platform. Lots of customers complain that Fiserv is not an open platform. They complain but that has done nothing to change market positioning over the years. Fiserv's least capable set of solutions is in the area of loan origination. It has been struggling with that issue for 10 years now, but then so too are its competitors to a greater or lesser degree. If it has slowed down the growth of revenues for the major companies in the industry, it isn't particularly apparent.If an investor wants FinTech, it ought to be one of the 3 large vendors (D+H which is based in Canada, is not public at this time). Both Fiserv and FIS have huge suites of products that are sold to their user base for specific purposes. The major categories that are sold to users are basically CRM (customer relationship management), various forms of analytics, various payment solutions and various risk and compliance solutions. Fiserv offers 700 discrete products. FIS offers the same set of solutions, packaged and named differently. About the only difference that can be discerned by most observers is that one company amalgamates 2 product buckets. At any given moment in time, one vendor or the other might be ahead in one particular segment or set of solutions - but that seldom lasts long. If a particular solution or set of functionality proves to be popular, it will soon be copied or more likely one of the larger firms will buy a smaller competitor who offers the newly desired capability.In 2012, Fiserv sued FIS for patent infringement in the payments area. Both FIS and Fiserv offer payments solutions based on technology - and really products - that were acquired through acquisition. Most recently, in December 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeals Board ruled against Fiserv and said that the patents in question could not be enforced because the patents in question are not patentable. There has been a trend in the world of software patents to declare more and more patented code as unpatentable. The decision leaves the playing field in the payments segment as it had been.Technology just is not and is unlikely to be a factor that ought to be considered in the investment decision. So it is all down to relative valuation.Comparative Valuation metrics between Fiserv and FISI have chosen the two larger FinTech vendors, FIS and FISV, to compare. That isn't because Jack Henry doesn't have its group of partisans in terms of its future share price performance, but because it is easier to specifically compare specifics regarding two very similar companies. For those readers specifically interested in Jack Henry, I recently wrote an article detailing its positioning and outlook.Size/Revenue analysis: Fiserv is forecast to achieve $5.6 billion in revenues during the current fiscal year; FIS is forecast to achieve $9.41 billion in revenues. Both companies have a very high proportion of revenues coming from recurring sources. FIS has 48% of its revenues coming from outsourcing. Fiserv probably has a comparable level, although not specifically disclosed on the latest conference call or in the 10k. Fiserv actually has a manufacturing operation that manufactures credit cards for its clients. Nowadays, that is a growth business as banks are moving their customer base to chip cards and will soon be moving customers to contactless cards. Overall, Fiserv software is 96% sold on multi-year contracts which can be typical on-premise deals or can be outsourced deals which is better for vendors and may be better for users as well, depending on their priorities. Outsourcing, mobile, payments and some SaaS growth are priorities for both companies. These are the revenue segments growing the most rapidly.Profitability: Fiserv's Q1 adjusted operating margins were 32%. The only major adjustment from GAAP to non-GAAP was the gain on the disposal of a business called Stone River. After adjusting for tax impact, the StoneRiver transaction was actually a loss. The company has some costs, after tax, from the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets which were stable year on year. The non-GAAP tax rate was accrued at 33% although the full-year tax rate estimate is 35%. Fiserv's stock-based comp is small and it is not reported on a quarterly basis. In 2015, stock-based comp, net of taxes was $27 million, which was less than 4% of net income.FIS had non-GAAP operating margins of 22%. Stock-based comp added $30 million or $22 million net of the income tax impact. That is the equivalent of 8% of reported non-GAAP earnings.The major adjustment to non-GAAP earnings is the add back of purchase accounting amortization of $154 million as well as the adjustment for deferred revenue and the adjustment for acquisition-related integration and severance costs. Most observers, this writer included, believe that these are really one-time costs and are reasonably excluded from an earnings presentation. The company had a non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter of 35%.Fiserv had interest expense of $40 million, while FIS had interest expense of $93 million. The rather elevated level of interest expense for FIS relates to the debt that was assumed as part of the SunGuard transaction.FIS saw outstanding shares increase by 40 million shares, or about 14%, which was part of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of SunGuard.Overall, FIS' non-GAAP operating margins, excluding the impact of stock-based comp would have been 21%, significantly less than the operating margins for Fiserv.Pre-tax margins for FIS, were just shy of 19%. Pre-tax margins for Fiserv were about 28%. The relatively large difference in both operating margins and pre-tax margins between the two companies represents the current impact of SunGuard which has historically been far less profitable than FIS. Over time, as FIS realizes the benefits of cost synergies, operating margins are expected to increase by 300-400 bps. That will still leave it below Fiserv in terms of margins and reflects the relatively low revenue per employee of the company. There is lots of room for FIS to improve that metric. but FISV is also on a cost reduction program to trim about $200 million of expenses over the next 5 years.Fiserv recorded a significant gain of $146 from the sale of its StoneRiver joint venture. This gain, net of taxes was excluded both from non-GAAP earnings and from free cash flow.Overall, and even considering the impact of the margin impact of the SunGuard merger, it appears that Fiserv is a more profitable company and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Fiserv is expecting 5%-6% of organic growth, but is expecting growth in adjusted earnings of 12%-15%. FIS is looking to grow organic revenues by 3%-4%, with a 15%-18% increase in adjusted earnings. Much of that increase in adjusted earnings is coming from the anticipated cost synergies from SunGuard. Much of the difference in longer-term profitability relates to the recently troubled Capco consulting business that FIS acquired a few years past, although that business has started to stabilize at this point.Balance Sheet/Cash flowBoth of these companies are run more to maximize cash flow and the growth of cash flow. Overall, both companies have done a good job in growing cash flow margins while maintaining decent balance sheets.Last quarter, FIS generated $385 million of operating cash flow and $338 million of free cash flow. Both numbers grew substantially year on year. Operating cash flow was up by 67% and free cash flow grew by 59%. Most of the growth for FIS in terms of its cash flow came from a doubling of depreciation and amortization and from a trebling of the deferred revenue balance year on year. These sums were significantly influenced by the acquisition of SunGuard. The company is projecting operating cash flow for the current year of about $1.5 billion with free cash flow projected at $1.3 billion. The company recorded an $111 million increase in the balance of capitalized computer software which was part of reported operating cash flow. Of course, spending money on development, capitalized or not, is a real cash cost and while the convention suggests that it not be included in a free cash flow calculation, the cash spent on development is not free. Capitalizing that much R&D reduces the quality of the earnings reported by FIS and influences the comparisons I make in this analysis.FIS had net debt of $10.6 billion. Debt declined by about $200 million in Q1. FIS has $790 million of deferred revenues, a decent increase in Q1.Fiserv had net debt of about $4.2 billion and it has deferred revenues of $480 million. Net debt increased by $150 million during the quarter primarily because the company made some smaller acquisitions that cost $265 million.Fiserv had decent cash flow and balance sheet metrics as well in its March quarter. Operating cash flow reached $509 million, up 47% from year-earlier levels. Free cash flow actually increased by 70% to $437 million. Cash flow growth was essentially driven by the increase in GAAP net income and by balance sheet items.Fiserv is projecting that free cash flow will exceed earnings. Overall, Fiserv is expecting free cash flow of $1050 million.FIS has 68% more revenues projected than does Fiserv, but the difference in terms of free cash flow projection is 24%. That will change to some degree as the cost synergies from SunGuard take hold, but overall, Fiserv basically has slightly higher organic growth and significantly better margins.In terms of valuation, Fiserv has an EV/S of 5.1X, it has a P/E based on the 2016 earnings consensus from 20 analysts of 24.7X, and a free cash flow yield of 3.7%.The comparable numbers for FIS are an EV/S of 3.7X, a P/E of 20X based on the consensus estimates of 21 analysts, and a free cash flow yield of 3.7%.Summing up the ComparisonFiserv is growing a bit faster overall and it is both more profitable and generates more cash than FIS does. Fiserv's free cash flow margin is substantially greater than that of FIS.FIS shares are up more than 26% YTD while Fiserv shares have appreciated by 18%. Fiserv doesn't pay dividends at this point although it certainly could; it has been more focused on share repurchase which has given the company the opportunity to enjoy greater long-term EPS growth than FIS.FIS has a current yield of 1.43% with a 52% payout ratio. Given that management's goal at FIS is to rapidly de-lever the balance sheet, no near-term dividend increase should be anticipated.After all of this, I still do not think that the investment merits of one of these vendors as compared to the other is particularly clear. If I were buying either of these names today, it would most likely be FISV. It has a higher organic growth rate that is likely to persist. Its free cash flow margin is much higher than that of FIS. Overall, bookings for Fiserv were only 70% of plan last quarter and yet the company still met or exceeded its earnings and cash flow targets. FIS had a great Q1 that was probably as good as it gets in terms of beating expectations. Fiserv believes that its bookings will significantly accelerate in the quarter that closed the other day. In addition, it will have the revenues from some recently acquired properties for a full quarter. Usually, in handicapping stocks, I like to look for ones with snap-back potential rather than those that are already at the top of their game. Fiserv certainly can have better bookings relative to quota than was the case in the March quarter.I do not think that there is all that much daylight between the two companies in terms of their investment merits. The fact that FISV doesn't pay a dividend may be an issue for some investors. The balance sheet leverage of FIS may be an issue for other investors. Fiserv appears to have a bit of an edge in payments and mobile software which is most likely why it is estimating organic growth a bit higher than FIS. It offers its clients a service called Popmoney which is essentially comparable to the Venmo service that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) offers. Popmoney is tiny at this point, but it might become big as banks scurry to compete in making personal, instantaneous money transfers.Fiserv gets most of its earnings from the US banking industry. While it does not break out foreign revenues specifically, it reported that 97% of its tax payments went to US and state governments and the 10K states that substantially all of the company's pre-tax earnings are derived from domestic operations. The company has some high profile international customers, including Allied Irish Banks (OTCPK:AIBSF), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Kuwait Finance House, Lloyds TSB and ING (NYSE:ING) to name a few of many.FIS currently gets about 25% of its revenues from off-shore sources. It has a significant operation in the UK. It has operations of some significance in both Argentina and Brazil.Interestingly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently recommended both FIS and FISV because they already paid high tax rates and had relatively low international exposure. Basically, the recommendation is based on election concerns and the populist statements of the candidates.Does it make sense to buy FISV shares now?Simple Answer - I don't think this is the optimal time to buy the shares. Fiserv shares made an all-time high last Friday. Technical analysis would rate the outlook positively I believe. Kudos to current holders. And Fiserv's absence from international markets is considered by many as a blessing.Since 2009 at the depth of the financial crisis, Fiserv's revenues, buoyed by acquisitions, have grown from $4.1 billion to $5.3 billion last year. That is a CAGR of just over 4%. More important, the EPS CAGR over that same period has been 13%. EPS has increased for this company for the last 30 quarters. Operating cash flow growth was just above 10% for the period. Capital spending has ramped significantly over the years, constraining the growth in free cash flow to a degree. But none of these metrics comes close to comparing with the 6.5X in share price over the same period. Valuation metrics have stretched significantly over the years. That alone is a troublesome background for a positive recommendation.But at the end of the day, Fiserv's customers are banks (and credit unions). To them, most FinTech solutions are capital expenditures. While, for the most part, Fiserv doesn't sell to the absolute largest banks, it certainly has customers whose operations will be affected by any banking crisis that may come or by a decline in overall economic activity. Many of this company's contracts are usage based - usually a good thing but not in a recession. Some large US customers include JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of New York (NYSE:BK), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), PNC Bank, National City Bk and Wachovia. These are customers in just the vertical of financial crime and risk management.The Italian banking crisis is smoldering without any likely resolution short of recapitalizing Italian banks. Almost all of the large customers Fiserv serves, have some relationships with some Italian financial institutions. In addition, the impact of Italian bank restructuring on the rest of the European banking system is not likely to be inconsequential. CEO Yabuki said that ""even as banks prognosticate (about macro trends) we are seeing an important bias to action in driving online and mobile solutions. Customer expectation are ratcheting up, and that translates to opportunities to further differentiate our broad catalog of solution…"" That may have been so in May. I have to wonder if Mr. Yabuki will be so sanguine with regards to his customers not paying attention to macro factors in their acquisition of banking software. It is, I believe, simply a risk not worth taking in front of the company's earnings release and conference call.For the record, I imagine that bookings did bounce back last quarter and that overall, the company showed a faster rate of revenue growth compared to Q1 and that its EPS was probably a beat. None of that will mean anything for the stock if guidance is not reaffirmed, and reaffirming guidance probably will not be enough to keep the shares on their current price trajectory. I would draw similar conclusions in analyzing the shorter-term outlook for FIS shares.Summing Up"
4013186,102176,2016-10-19T14:10:24-04:00,Market's concerns are valid but overblown.First Data holds valuable asset but is under appreciated.Both comp analysis and cash flow analysis suggest at least 50% upside on conservative valuation.,"IntroFirst Data (FDC) is a company with high-margin businesses in very attractive industries but currently trades at around a half of its peers' valuation. In this article, I will list Mr. Market's reasons for such low valuation and elaborate on why I believe that despite some valid concerns about the company, the market has been overly bearish and the valuation gap should narrow.Comparison against its peersAlthough there are some competitors listed from First Data's annual report including Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and etc, they are ill suited for comp analysis because these companies own other businesses that First Data lack. The companies listed below, also competitors listed from First Data's annual report, are the best comparison candidates because they almost exclusively operate in the same segments as First Data. Among the comp peers, Vantiv resembles First Data the most because it competes on all fronts with First Data. Worldpay and Global Payments focus exclusively on merchant acquiring which is First Data in First Data's biggest segment (I will explain all the segments later). Total System Services only competes with First Data in the smaller card processing division.Note: Market cap, net debt, adjusted TTM EBITDA in millions. Market prices are from Oct 18 th 2016. Worldpay's market cap and debt are in British Pound. Analysts' forward earnings estimates for Vantiv, Global Payments, Total System Services, and First Data are from Nasdaq.com and Worldpay is from FT.com. Net debt and adjusted TTM EBITDA figures are based on these companies' earnings releases and annual reports from their respective investor relations websites and further adjusted by subtracting stock compensation.Why does the valuation gap exist?Heavy debt burden. This is definitely the biggest concern. When KKR took First Data private before the financial crisis, the private equity firm loaded First Data with debt and the deal was one of the biggest LBOs (leveraged buyout) in history. As we can see from the previous comp analysis, First Data's peers have a much lower debt/EBITDA ratio. The market worries about First Data's default risk.Market share loss/stale growth. Because of high interest expenses, the company could not put enough resources into important functions such as R&D and sales and struggled to maintain its competitive advantage. Innovation stopped and growth became stale while First Data's peers enjoyed very healthy growth.High churn in small business segment. The company focused on signing up small merchants but offered very poor support and customer service. As a result, the company has been losing many customers who do not renew their contracts.Leon Cooperman insider trading case. This is very recent news. Mr. Cooperman holds shares of First Data and the stock has been suffering since the insider-trading charge against Mr. Cooperman emerged. The market is worried that Insider trading charge leads to possible liquidation and forced selling of the stock from Mr. Cooperman's fund.At a glance, the market does seem to have some very solid reasons to discount First Data. Many potential investors probably would turn away right because of the high debt burden. However, it is time to be a contrarian and find out if the situation is indeed as grim as the market fears. First, let us find out what kind of businesses First Data own.GBS, GFS and NSS -- What does First Data do?Per its 2015 10-K, First Data is""the largest merchant acquirer, issuer processor, and independent network services provider in the world."" It has the following three segments:Global Business Solutions (GBS): This largest segment mainly includes its merchant acquiring business and its cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) system Clover. For anyone needs a brief explanation on the term merchant acquiring -- when customers check out either at a physical store or online with an electronic payment option (credit card/debit card/gift card/PayPal), merchant acquirer acts as the messenger that handles all the communication among the POS, the card issuing bank, and the merchant's bank. POS takes customer's payment information and pass this to the merchant acquirer. Then the acquirer figures out which network to use(Visa/Master/Debt/etc.) and routes the processing request to card issuer for approval. Once the issuer reaches a decision, it informs the acquirer and the acquirer relays back the message to the POS. At the end of the day, the acquirer routes many messages in the batched settlement process in which the merchant settles all the daily transactions with various payment issuers. CreditCards.com has a more thorough explanation here. Besides the merchant acquiring business, the Clover business according to management is not yet material to earnings so I will not go into mcuh details. I only will say that this online POS business is in crowded competition against many start-ups and established players.Global Financial Solutions (GFS): In this segment, First Data enables credit card issuers to offer financial products to their customers. First Data's clients include some of the world's biggest financial institutions and big-box merchants and the available services include card issuing/processing services and account support services such as generating monthly statements and posting cardholder payments. First Data charges fees under contracts and the amount of the service fee is dependent on the size of the cardholder accounts under the contract. In other words, the more cardholders are under the contract, the higher contract fee is.Network & Security Solutions (NSS): This segment offers services that deal with payment security and fraud preventions. First Data owns STAR, one of the nation's biggest pin-debit network. While big banks might be able to afford its own secure network, other card issuers might not want to. Instead, they turn to First Data or Vantiv who own secure networks and pay for the network usage. First Data collects revenue on transactions routed on the STAR network. Also in this segment, First Data offers services in gift card issuing and processing to merchants.In terms of geographical breakdown, U.S. is First Data's biggest market, contributing 5.5 billion of the company's total 7 billion revenue in 2015. EU is a distant second with a 1 billion revenue. Asia and Latin America each contributed around 260 million.After getting some ideas of First Data's businesses, I want to touch on why I think First Data is a great company to own.Secular TailwindContinued shift to a cash-less based society. According to this Federal Reserve survey published in 2015, between 2003 and 2012, credit card, debit card, prepaid card and ACH usage experienced very healthy growth at the expense of checks. The report summarizes the finding as such:Moreover, this trend is not just limited to the United States but rather it is a global phenomenon. A separate article shows that globally the number of transactions grew from 269 billion times in 2009 to 390 billion times in 2014 and cites that the Federal Reserve estimates that there will be $616.9 billion dollars of cashless transactions in 2016, up from around $60 billion in 2010. Yet despite the explosive ten-fold increase in cashless transactions, there is still vast room for further rapid growth. This same article points out in the U.S cashless transactions are only around 45% of total transactions, much lower compared to countries such as Singapore, the Netherlands, or Sweden, where about 60% of total transactions are cashless. Germany is even lower at 33% and China, Japan, and Brazil are only in the teens. Cash still accounts for a dominating 85% on global average. These data and forecasts bode very well for the electronic payment processing industry and First Data.Highly Capable CEOPast achievements demonstrate high capacity. Many people probably read about First Data's CEO joined as co-COO from JP Morgan. But who exactly is this guy? Wikipedia has detailed business achievements of Frank Bisignano, First Data's CEO. In brief, he has over 20 years of experience working in different roles in various big banks including First Fidelity, Citigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan. At Citigroup, he increased the revenue for his division from an annual $4 billion to $6 billion and turned a net income loss of $400 million to profit of over $1 billion. At JPMorgan, Dimon trusted him with integrating Bear Sterns and Washington Mutual during the financial crisis. Then he became head of the Mortgage Banking unit and again turned the division's previous year loss of 2.1 billion into income of 3.3 billion in 2012. Past successes show he is a true turn-around expert, a perfect fit for the CEO role of First Data. Right after he joined First Data, he dissuaded owner KKR from selling the GFS decision, telling KKR that he believed ""I could fix it."" After 3 years, the NSS and GFS divisions have experienced healthy growth. In addition, management successfully pushed First Data's entire debt obligation to the next decade, solving a major overhang of the company.Attractive businesses to ownBiggest merchant acquirer in the U.S. Even after the no growth period, First Data's acquiring business remains as the biggest in the States. But why does size matter? Because the domestic industry has increasingly become consolidated and scale helps to battle other big merchant acquirers. Vantiv, the second biggest merchant acquirer in the U.S. right behind First Data, claims to have processed 6.18 billion dollars of transactions in 2016 Q2 and around 23 billion dollars for the whole year of 2015. By comparison, First Data in the most recent quarter reports that it processed 22.5 billion dollars for the first half of 2016, a half year figure that's almost as big as the full year figure of the industry's NO.2 player. This shows that what stockholders own is not a company that has fallen completely behind the competition but rather a valuable company that is still very ahead in the game, albeit with a shrinking lead and anemic growth. The main problem in growth, according to management's earning calls, is isolated in the SMB (Small-Medium Business) space and caused by a high SMB client attrition rate. However, on the hand, the large national clients are actually very happy with the company's service and First Data bagged quite a few national account wins including Chick-fil-A, Cabela's (NYSE:CAB), PetSmart (NASDAQ:PETM), and Toys ""R"" Us.High margin businesses. First Data's Global Business Solutions segment has consistently generated around 40% EBITDA margin over the years. The new management also dramatically reduced the cost basis of the other two segments so that in the most recent quarterly report the Global Financial Solutions and Network & Security Solutions divisions enjoyed 40.5% and 45.4% EBITDA margin respectively.Fast growing and sticky GFS business: the Global Financial Solution segment, the business that supports card issuers with processing and account maintenance, in the last two quarters grew revenue 12% and 14% in constant currency year over year. A contract with customers last for years and customers are generally reluctant to switch solution providers once they become accustomed to a particular provider's offering, making this business very sticky. I think growth in this segment could be attributed to CEO Bisignano's leadership. Customers in this segment are mainly small and mid-size banks. And where is Bisignano from? Bank. Bisignano understands very well these customers' need and speaks their language.One of the biggest debit network operators. According to the aforementioned Fed Survey, debit card usage witnessed the biggest jump in terms of transaction number, increasing three fold from 15.6 billion times in 2003 to 47 billion times in 2012. First Data's STAR network is one of the biggest pin-debit network in the nation and naturally a big beneficiary of the on-going debit card boom.Good International exposure. First Data's Latin America business has been on fire. Revenue from that region grew 44% in constant currency in the latest quarter and quickly becoming a meaningful contribution to earnings. Although inflation is part of the reason to the growth, the company has been adding customers rapidly in Brazil. It also recently entered the Argentina and Columbia markets, two markets with big potential that are still in infancy stage of electronic payments.Addressing Market ConcernsIn this section, I will address the concerns listed in the beginning and explain why I believe they are overblown.Heavy debt burden and high default risk. None of the debt matures until 2020 at the earliest and the debt maturities span over five years with the latest debt due in 2024, a situation that should be quite manageable. Management has stated that they will use majority of the company's free cash flow to pay down debt and according to my estimate (detailed walkthrough discussed later), the company should be able to generate over 1.3 billion free cash per year. That means from now until 2024, the company can generate about 8-9 billion free cash and nearly half the current 19 billion debt, making First Data's Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA around 4 times which is quite manageable and very close to its peers.Slow growth caused by high SMB attrition. Management had to deal with myriad of problems and could not solely focus on this issue. However, with many other priorities solved, management should have enough resources to concentrate on this problem. Management stated that this is a very persistent problem and attrition rate remains high as of the last quarter. The team continues to tackle the issue with a multi-pronged approach and things might get better in the future. Based on what Bisignano has achieved in his past positions and what he has accomplished so far in First Data, I believe he has a decent chance of solving the problem. But even if it turns out that management could not fix the issue, it still would not be the end of world for First Data. Because after all, the SMB segment is only part of the acquiring business. The company still has a very healthy acquiring business with large merchants, a fast growing GFS segment and a NSS segment growing at moderate pace.Cooperman insider trading case. I actually think this is good news. Regardless of the outcome from the insider trading charge, the entry cost for First Data stock decreased, which is great news for potential investors. In addition, this news in no way changes the fundamentals of the company. Is the stock currently cheap enough? I think so. However, I am also cognizant of the fact that based on how the insider charge goes the stock might turn even lower. To prepare for such possibility, or blessing in disguise should I say, investors should maintain some liquidity so that they can buy more on the dip and lower their cost basis.Future cash flow analysis and stock valuationAssumptionsIn the past twelve months, First Data's three divisions GBS, GFS, and NSS have adjusted EBITDA (excluding stock compensation and one-time costs) of 1691 million, 622 million, and 668 million respectively. Revenues and EBITDA picked up in GFS and NSS this year while GBS's growth is a mere 1%. Based on the sticky nature of the businesses, for the forward 12 months, I assign an 8% increase in forward EBITDA for the GFS division(much lower than the recent 30% jump), a 3% increase for the NSS division(again much lower than the 16% and 6% quarterly increase), and no growth in EBITDA for the GBS division, an assumption that seems achievable and conservative.Recent segment revenue/EBITDA growth trend and forward EBITDA assumptionSource: 16 Q1 and Q2 figures based on First Data's 2016 Q1 and Q2 earning releasesNext, corporate cost has been stable at -140 million EBITDA per year, the same figure I use for next year's cash flow estimate. Depreciation is around 1 billion based on last year's figure. Interest expense based on the list of debt obligations from latest 10-Q filing and the most recent interest reduction news is estimated at 1,050 million. I use a theoretical 30% tax rate because First Data has sizeable oversea business with lower tax rate than the States. The effective tax rate, however, should be much lower because the company has 3.8 billion deferred tax assets (First Data's 2015 10-K lists 1.1-billion deferred tax asset and a further 2.7 billion valuation allowance that is likely to reverse in the future). 2017 capital expenditure of 450 million approximates the lowered spending in the first two quarters of this year because management in earning calls has said many growth initiatives have already been put in place and capex will moderate in the future.Forward 12-month cash flow calculation (in millions)Figures based on First Data's past four quarter earnings releases. Normalized FCF is calculated based on income + D&A - capex and near-term cash flow is based on income with tax benefits + D&A - capex + stock compensation.From the above calculation we can see, investors are paying about 10.5 times the next year normalized free cash flow for First Data, a multiple that is quite low based on the quality of the business, the management, and the prospect of the e-payment industry.CatalystsRevenue increase. There are multiple ways for the company to increase its revenue. The most certain revenue increase comes from First Data's large clients. The company has already won quite a few big contracts from large enterprise and these wins take typically 9 months or more to realize revenue from new clients. In addition, the company showed itself capable of expanding its relationship with large clients and cross-sell more services. However, less certain is the development on the SMB segment and the improvement might not materialize in the near future. I think the chance of a success SMB turnaround is about 50%. Moreover, there are a couple long shots such like the Clover POS business and the Gyft gift card business.Highly leveraged capital structure will boost earnings. The biggest market concern actually is, at the same time, a blessing in disguise. First, as the company pays down interest, it creates an earning boost on the bottom line. Every billion dollars of debt paid down will give the company between 50-70 million savings on interest expenses, which translates into 35-50 million net income and a 350-500 million in market cap assuming a 10X P/E. And we have shown First Data should be able to pay down billions of debt in the future. The next point is that high debt load will actually make the net income increase look more pronounced compared to a company that is less leveraged. This is a very important yet subtle point and for those who are not familiar with this very concept there is a more detailed explanation in the appendix.Easy net GAAP income comp in the next three quarters. First Data'sGAAP income in the last 4 quarters was all in the red except the most recent quarter. There were a lot of one time charges, such as IPO cost and restructuring cost, taken in the earlier quarters and the interest expense was much higher than the current level. Going forward, with the much lower interest expense and cost reduction initiatives taking effect, even without a higher revenue, GAAP income comp quarter over quarter should be very easy until second quarter of 2017.SummaryI know this is a quite long article and I appreciated if you have come this far. Much ink has been spilled so let us tie up all the points. First Data is trading at around half of its peers' multiples based on forward earnings. We also run through a cash flow analysis and finds the stock trades around 10 times 2017 cash flow. Although its peers do deserve a premium over First Data because of lower debt level and faster growth, the market looks overly bearish on First Data's prospect. First, First Data's debt will not start maturing until the next decade and our cash flow analysis shows that the company will be able to pay down a lot of debt before debt maturities. Second, there is a decent chance that growth will pick up in the future. In the past, management had to spend a lot of effort on the survival of the company and, after the debt became manageable, the management can now finally concentrate on the growth phase. We already see the growth initiatives bearing fruits on the GFS and NSS segment and there is a good chance for the biggest segment GBS to grow again. Third, despite the market gain of First Data's peers, First Data still holds many valuable assets. It is still the biggest merchant acquirer in the U.S. by a wide margin and owns one of the nation's biggest debit network. Under the rein of Bisignano, First Data deepened and expanded many important relationships with its big financial institution and large merchant clients, an initiative that lead to new contract wins and more cross-selling. Fourth, CEO Bisignano has a very impressive background in turning around businesses in different companies and so far, he has done a fabulous job at First Data, a sign that a full turnaround of First Data is quite possible. Lastly, the industry benefits from inevitable shift to a cashless society, a trend that will also help First Data in earning growth.Because of the above reasons, the stock deserves a better valuation. A 15-16 times forward P/E or a 15 times normalized free cash flow should be fair, implying 40% - 50% potential increase above current stock level. Even at that level, First Data will be at about 2/3 of its peers' valuation, taking consideration of the higher debt ratio and current slower business growth compared to its competitors. But the current 10-11X forward P/E and cash flow simply feels like there is more than justifiable amount of pessimism on this stock.Although I suggest purchasing a sizable position at current level, as the 3rd quarter earnings release approaches on Nov 7th and the Cooperman insider charge case still hangs in the air, I also suggest investors keep some dry powder in case of a further stock price drop in the near term.Appendix:Capital structure effect on earningsAssume there are two companies with the same revenue, cost, and tax rate. The only difference is that company A does not have any debt at all but company B does.Then revenue and cost increase the same amount for both companies.We can see although both companies' earnings increased 7, the leveraged company B's earning increases 50% while company A's earning only increases 20%."

4013073,86776,2016-10-19T08:37:06-04:00,The ups and downs of the IPO.Focusing on what matters.Lessons learned – and still being learned.,"Last Saturday - October 15, 2016 - was the one-year anniversary of the First Data IPO.Now, admittedly, calling 2016 a ""first year"" for First Data is something of a stretch. First Data was first incorporated in 1971, so it is actually 45 years young. And it wasn't even technically First Data's first year as a publicly traded company either. From 1992 to 2007, it traded on the NYSE before being taken private by KKR.That, First Data CEO Frank Bisignano told me in a wide-ranging chat about the first year of its most recent IPO, is but one of the things that makes First Data a very unusual initial public offering.And, in fact, ""it's just different"" could probably be the 2016 mantra for what Bisignano referred to as First Data's ""rebirth year."" Because, at quick glance, First Data is a very different company than it was just one year ago.Different culturally. Different financially. And different in the way that First Data talks to its clients about what it does.My interest in wanting to speak with Frank on the eve of First Data's one-year IPO anniversary was to better understand how that ""different First Data"" came to be over the course of this last year, how he knew that First Data was ready to march back into the public market spotlight a year and a couple of days ago and his reflections on the first year as a publicly traded company - for the second time.Here's what he told me.THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE IPONo one reading this will be surprised to learn that Frank Bisignano likes a challenge and likes winning in the face of big ones. What drew him to First Data in the first place, he told me, was the challenge of turning around a company with great clients and a great market position but with lots of areas for improvement. One of the things that he's especially proud of is the fact that First Data, to this day, holds the title of biggest tech IPO so far - raising about $2.56 billion in the public markets. We even joked that his record will likely stay unbroken despite Snap, Inc.'s plans. (It's rumored that they are looking to raise $1.8 billion).Bisignano is even more proud of the fact that First Data's IPO went forward at a time that so many others pulled their plans to do so. Market volatilities made going to the public markets risky. But Bisignano stuck with the original plan for one simple reason: His customers and his team said they were ready. That was all, he told me, he needed to decide that he was ready, too.Ready - but still not easy.Moving from private company to the public markets meant being ready to face the $22.6 billion headwind that fueled investor skepticism over First Data's chances of pulling off a successful IPO. First Data's legacy at that time was as much about being saddled with that massive debt burden as it was being the world's largest merchant services company processing nearly half of the world's payment volume.""When I first came [to First Data], our interest expense was eating up a lot of our money, and we had very, very little cash,"" Bisignano reflected.That reality stuck with investors. First Data opened trading on its first day a little more than 2 percent above its $16 a share threshold, hoping to raise $3.7 billion. At the end of the first day of trading, First Data closed about 1.5 points lower than that, adding $2.56 billion to its bank account - and not the $3.7 billion it had hoped for.The stock price fluctuated a lot over its first several months of trading, but it was First Data's Q4 2015 results that saw the stock plummet 8 percent to a low of roughly $10 in February. First Data's lofty debt service burden, coupled with disappointing earnings, was the big culprit.But, Bisignano said, that was then, and this is now - and he pointed to the last six months of First Data's performance as proof that First Data has turned an important corner.Through refinancing and organically paying down debt, First Data seems to have quelled the concerns of investors, for now. The stock is back up to a little more than $13. Investors seem buoyed by the fact that First Data has a few more options and a lot of breathing room to recalibrate the company's capital structure and prove that it's capable of both servicing its debt and generating free cash flow.During last quarter's earnings call, Bisignano reported that First Data put $500 million in cash to the bottom line in the first six months of the year.And, from Bisignano's perch, First Data's future.FOCUSING ON WHAT MATTERSBisignano made it clear to me that, although he's happy how First Data's deleveraging story has improved Wall Street's view of First Data over the last six months, he doesn't put much stock in First Data's share price (no pun intended). What means more to him is First Data's clients and the company's ability to create solutions that go beyond simply processing a payment. If First Data can do that, the rest - meaning the stock price - he said, will take care of itself.""We were the world's largest [payments processing company] when we rang the NYSE bell, and we still are. But this business today requires companies like ours to be a solutions provider,"" Bisignano reflected. He also acknowledged that, at the time of the IPO, many remained publicly skeptical that First Data could deliver on that requirement, saying that it was too big a leap for First Data to make - or if it could, it wouldn't happen in a time frame that its clients would find acceptable. The unspoken words: Its clients would go elsewhere to get those services.That, Bisignano said, meant pushing First Data's pedal hard on mobile, global and digital. He believed that, for its clients to remain competitive in a dynamic payments and commerce environment, First Data had to deliver solutions that would deliver a competitive edge for those clients. Delivering that required two things: a team that was invested in and capable of creating innovative solutions and taking them to market and a client partnership mindset better aligned with what clients wanted and needed to transform their business with what First Data was offering.That, Bisignano told me, in the first instance, meant getting the culture right, something that became a big focus in his first year. The goal was to get everyone in the company to think of First Data ""as a meritocracy,"" which included issuing equity in 2014 that gave everyone in the company a stake in its future. Then, as one big team, sharing the same goals and with the same incentives to achieve them, Bisignano said that he could focus the company on what he believes has become the game-changer for First Data - investing in the innovation that its clients were asking for and that investors would later find compelling.""We love to partner with our clients; we love to build solutions with them that help them drive mobile and digital. And once we do, we iterate with them on those solutions so that we can continue to deliver the kind of value that helps them grow their business,"" Bisignano emphasized.Nowhere, he said, is this more visible than with Clover.Clover is First Data's answer to serving the small business market that is most often associated with players like Square or the many tablet providers who today bundle payments processing with software and hardware solutions.It also happens to be one of the hardest markets to serve.Not only is every merchant services player now focused on small business - making the competitive environment fierce - but as a segment, small businesses are anything but easy to reach and serve. They're among the most heterogeneous, price-sensitive, thinly resourced and fragile segments of business.But that's where Bisignano told me Clover shines.First Data created Clover as a ""business in a box"" solution that does more than process payments. Clover is a platform that helps small businesses run their businesses through a variety of apps and capabilities that come bundled with its sleek hardware. Clover can, for example, help small businesses set up a website to sell online. As a result, he said, there's more of a reason for small businesses to sign on, stay on and remain a viable business.""We have clear information that small businesses who use Clover do better and are less fragile with Clover than without it,"" Bisignano told me.LESSONS LEARNED - AND STILL BEING LEARNEDFirst Data's first year as a public company has seen the company smooth over a few bumps in the road and turn a few important corners. Yet, Bisignano said, there is a lot more work to be done.Mobile and global remain at the top of his list of innovations to continue to invest in and develop. Bisignano said that there's clearly a lot of runway to continue to gain share in the small business segment that's a key firm priority. Data - First Data's middle name, we joked - is getting a new lease on life as the firm has introduced a number of new data products aimed at helping retailers of all sizes get their hands on curated and relevant data to help them make better business decisions.I wondered, though, what advice he might offer firms like Snap, Inc. contemplating the move to becoming a publicly traded company. Not unsurprisingly, Bisignano advised really sweating the small stuff.""The journey to raise capital in the equity market is an important journey, and the roadshows are critically important. Companies must be ready, be prepared and be thoughtful,"" he offered.In other words, make sure your house is in order, make sure you do your homework and make sure that you have a plan that investors will buy for how you'll make money.Finally, I asked, how has being a public company changed First Data?And, surprisingly, Bisignano told me that it really hasn't, telling me that running First Data - the public company - is pretty similar to running First Data - the private company - under his command.Except for one important thing.But, he quickly emphasized, being ""pleased"" is something of a relative term that doesn't mean obsessing over the First Data stock price day-to-day. Doing that, he reminded me, would cause him to ignore his most important job: serving clients.An obsession that any client, investor, partner or team member would find more than acceptable from a CEO who's clearly in it to win it."
4145593,101837,2018-02-12T09:02:10-05:00,"Fiserv posted another strong quarter of earnings, surpassing analysts' expectations.Revenue and margins have grown via acquisitions and operational savings programs.Management continues to execute strategy with 32 years of consecutive double-digit EPS growth.Share repurchases and favorable economic conditions will aid in future stock growth.","Another year has gone by and another year of Fiserv (FISV) executing their strategy exactly like they said they would. Fiserv, a world leader in financial services technology, posted a strong fourth quarter, surpassing analysts’ expectations with 7% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.52 billion and 22% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth to $1.44. More importantly, this closes out another spectacular fiscal year where top line growth was met with margin expansion.Management performed up to expectations in 2017 posting full-year EPS of $5.12 after forecasting $5.03 to $5.17 during their 2016 Q4 Earnings Call. Obviously, Fiserv isn’t the only company to meet their own EPS projections, but they have done it for the past 3 years on the high end of their initial forecast range. In 2015, management forecasted 2016 EPS of $4.32 to $4.44 and earnings came in at $4.43. Likewise, in 2014, forecasts were $3.73 to $3.83 for fiscal year 2015 and earnings came in at $3.87. This is even more impressive when you consider they have grown their earnings by double digits for 32 consecutive years. Fiserv’s ability to grow EPS and accurately forecast it should give investors more confidence in management.How has Fiserv been able to grow their top and bottom lines so consistently over the years? Over the past few years, the answer has been through acquisitions. For example, Fiserv acquired the real-time open technology account processing platform DNA from Open Solutions Inc. in 2013 to help grow their Financial business segment. Just recently, Fiserv announced the huge signing of Sallie Mae to DNA Digital Payment Bundle which includes Architect. This new client addition helped increase 2017 Architect Sales by 300% from last year.In 2017 alone, Fiserv acquired the following four companies for a combined $385 million: PCLender, Dovetail, Monitise and Online Banking Solutions. Already, Fiserv has announced signing four times the number of customers and seven times the total contract value from last year to Commercial Center, the leading product of the Online Banking Solutions acquisition. It’s still a little too early to see any material impact from some of the other acquisitions on the financials now, but Fiserv has proven their ability to unlock new value for their clients and shareholders through acquisitions. Investors should expect to see future growth driven by acquisitions.Fiserv’s growth should also stand to benefit from favorable economic conditions like rising interest rates and excess capital due to lower corporate tax rates. Rising interest rates should help financial institutions, the majority of Fiserv’s clients, earn more money and increase IT infrastructure spend. Additionally, the recent corporate tax cuts will give financial institutions even more money to invest in their IT infrastructure. Of course, not every single dollar earned or saved from rising rates and lower taxes will be spent on Fiserv’s products, but it certainly does help Fiserv’s growth prospects.A major contribution to 32 consecutive years of double-digit EPS growth is consistent margin growth. Fiserv has grown their gross, operating and profit margin in each of the last 3 years. Most of their margin expansion comes from gross margin, but profit margin did increase by 5% in 2017 due to a lower income tax provision. Additionally, I would expect profit margin to be further aided in 2018 with the recent corporate tax cuts.Fiserv has also undertaken key cost savings initiatives to achieve greater operational efficiency. They are currently in year 3 of a 5-year $250 million operational savings plan. In 2017, they saved $82 million from data center consolidation and workforce optimization and procurement programs. Overall, they have achieved 60% of the $250 million savings objective. Even if they don’t hit the $250 million savings objective after 5 years, long-term investors should still be satisfied that there is great progress and focus on cost-control even for a growing technology company.Another contribution to consistent EPS growth is participating in shareholder friendly activities such as share repurchases to lower their overall share count. The board authorized in November 2016 an additional 15 million share repurchase program. This was one year after the board had already authorized an initial 15 million shares to be repurchased. Through three quarters of 2017, management was effective at purchasing over 2 million shares between $123-125 a share, representing a more than 8% discount to the current share price. They still have over 12 million shares authorized to repurchase under the current program. The share repurchase program signals to investors that management thinks the stock is a good long-term investment and should give investors even more confidence.(Source: Fiserv 10-Q)This reliability in management’s EPS forecast makes it easier to predict Fiserv’s future stock price. Looking at historical P/E ratios, Fiserv has traded between 21 and 26 times trailing 12 months adjusted EPS. Furthermore, the P/E has been trending up over the last few years so there’s reason to believe the 2018 year-end P/E could be trading at more than 26 times EPS. Management has forecasted 2018 full-year EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.30 a share. Again, management has shown over the past few years to be reliable and somewhat conservative in their EPS forecast. Given these estimates, Fiserv has a 1-year target price range of $127 to $161 with a target price of $155. Fiserv is currently trading around $136 a share so the target price would represent over 13% upside from the current price. 13% return isn’t abnormally large or spectacular, but it’s much better to buy a good company at a bad price, than a bad company at a good price.(Source: Author’s Calculation)Fiserv is a great long-term growth stock investment with a competent management team that has a proven track record of producing results. Even with the post earnings jump, the current price is still a good entry point for long-term investors. Additionally, with the given market turbulence recently, investors should keep an eye on Fiserv and look at aggressively adding a position if the stock drops with the market."
3958510,101421,2016-03-15T09:40:37-04:00,"Retail investors have the opportunity to acquire recent IPO stocks below their IPO price.Consider these pre-screened quality technology companies for future growth upside.First Data is the best choice, with Mimecast also worth a close look.","Did you miss out on the hottest technology company Initial Public Offerings in the second half of 2015?Most individual retail investors don't qualify for an ""allocation"" of IPO stock, so it's worth a look to see where these companies are today and what their prospects are for the future.For this latest batch of tech IPO graduates, the recent market gyrations resulted in major downward revaluations of newly-public tech startups who were once thought to be the next huge thing.While there are probably good reasons to avoid some of these upstarts until the wider stock market dust settles, I looked at the 30 tech IPOs in the second half of 2015 to see if there were any top performers still trading at a discount to their IPO price yet are growing revenues and cash from operations.The ContendersOf the 30 U.S. technology IPOs in the second half of 2015, I applied a few initial filters:The following six companies made the initial cut:So what separates the six initial screen candidates?Each of the first four companies - Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), Ooma (NYSE:OOMA), Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and Dimension Therapeutics (NASDAQ:DMTX) - have negative cash flow from operations.But the finalists (shaded green in the image) meet the initial screen criteria AND are positive cash flow:The FinalistsFirst Data represented by far the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2015, raising $2.56 billion in gross proceeds. In the general market sell-off, the stock fell to below $9 per share in February, but has since bounced back to $13.22, while currently trading at a 17% discount to its IPO price of $16.The company generated $6.6 billion in 2015 revenues, $71 million in cash and cash equivalents during 2015 and ended the year with a cash balance of $368 million.Mimecast, based in London, UK, raised $78 million in gross IPO proceeds in November, 2015 at a price of $10 per share. In late January, the stock fell below $6.50 per share before rebounding to its current $8.91.The stock is now trading at an 11% discount to its IPO price while the company generated $11.95 million in cash from operating activities for the six months ended 9/30/2015. Annual revenues are running at the rate of $138 million.Who's the overall winner?First Data wins the numbers prize for two reasons:What's the bullish case for First Data?Since CEO Frank Bisignano took the helm of First Data in 2013, his stated aim has been to focus on the small and medium business market, which typically provides higher margins than large enterprises.Since the economic downturn, small businesses have taken the greatest hit, but now have the greatest future upside, so First Data is clearly positioning itself for improvement in small business activity.Second, Bisignano has also focused on improving the company's technological chops, such as an early alliance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Apple Pay. This was touted as a ""milestone in First Data's transformation from a payments processor to a solutions provider."" (Press Release.)While Apple Pay hasn't set the world on fire with high adoption rates, First Data was quick to get into the still-early game of digital wallet technology.Third, the company continues to make strategic acquisitions to further diversify its revenue streams. Most notably, it acquired Spree Commerce in September, 2015 to bolster its open-source payment solutions initiatives and online Ecommerce presence.Fourth, while First Data is still exposed to the gas station market, the bad news of the great oil bust and concomitant drop in revenue base is now largely baked into the stock. The company's diversification away from indirect commodity exposure toward online and technology-driven initiatives continues unabated.Fifth, on the financial side, reduced debt service expenses will free up operating cash to invest in new initiatives. On March 9, 2016, the company announced the pricing of $900 million debt at 5% interest rate. The proceeds will be used to pay down existing debt.So, in summary, CEO Bisignano isn't afraid to shake up this industry junior to behemoths MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V). He continues to execute on his vision of increased revenue diversity, technological advancement and improving the company's operating cost structure.Note: While the company's six-month lockup period doesn't expire until mid-April, the current consensus rating of 23 stock analysts is a BUY."
3961248,77775,2016-03-29T05:00:00-04:00,"First Data Corporation is an easy-to-sell stock. You can put industry leader, recurring revenue, +40% adjusted EBITDA margins, deleveraging story and growth initiatives in the same PowerPoint presentation.A closer look into the payment processing industry, the company's business model, its reported financials and management's adjusted numbers reveals serious problems for shareholders.Investors should avoid First Data Corporation at the current share price.","At a first glance, First Data Corporation (NYSE:FDC) looks interesting, considering that the company:However, a closer look reveals problems for shareholders, including:a) At the benefit of merchants, the industry has been shifting to a more transparent pricing strategy, with a focus on integrated POS solutions.b) Mainly as a result of a), the company has been losing market share in the merchant acquiring space despite decreasing its Revenue per Transaction (RPT) year over year.c) The abnormal yoy increase of accounts receivable relative to sales illustrates that the quality of the company's revenues is deteriorating.d) Management's 4Q15 adjusted EBITDA is misleading. Re-adjusting it accordingly reveals that adjusted EBITDA was (at best) flat yoy.e) Even if the ignore c) and d), there are other issues that should give investors some pause.Before addressing each point in detail, it is worth recalling some industry basics.The Payments Processing IndustryThe following diagram from the Visa (NYSE:V) annual report shows the main players involved in a traditional payment transaction:Merchant acquirers sign merchants to accept credit/debit card transactions, and they are the primary point of contact with merchants. After the customer's card is swiped in the Point of Sale (POS) device, merchant acquirers or their processors receive the customer's card details, identify the appropriate payment network (Visa, MasterCard (NYSE:MA), etc.) and send the request. After receiving the request, the payment network identifies the appropriate card issuer bank and routes the transaction to the bank (or to its issuer processor). Lastly, the card issuer bank approves or denies the transaction, and the information travels back to the POS device. This sub-process is often called capture and authorization. The clearing and settlement is the other sub-process that takes place in an electronic payment transaction, but since it mainly involves the same players, we'll skip it.One of the complexities of the payments processing industry is that in most cases, all or some of these distinct functions are performed by the same entity. For example, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is an issuing bank, a merchant acquirer through Chase Paymentech and processes its own transactions. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also an issuing bank and a merchant acquirer, but outsources transaction processing. Vantiv (NYSE:VNTV), Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) and Heartland Payment Systems (NYSE:HPY) (recently acquired by Global Payments) are non-bank merchant acquirers/processors, yet Vantiv also provides processing solutions for issuing banks.Getting into the underlying business economics, Heartland Payment Systems discloses the allocation of funds from a $100 transaction:Interchange fees and the network's revenues are set up by the networks. The merchant acquirer takes that price and charges a discount fee to the merchant (2.3%) after adding a markup (0.50%), which is entirely discretional. Depending on the acquirer's pricing policy, the discount fee can vary across merchants, geographies, size and type of transaction, etc. As you can expect, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) gets better prices that mom-and-pop stores. As a result, JPMorgan analysts estimate that while small and medium-sized merchants make up 30-35% of bank purchase volume, they generate 65-75% of domestic acquiring spread revenue. Additionally, a merchant acquirer can outsource transaction processing. In the case of Heartland Payment, the company is a merchant acquirer and processes its acquired transactions.First Data Corporation is involved in the whole payment processing chain, and operates domestically (around 65% of sales) and internationally (around 35% of sales). The company provides merchant acquiring services, processes transactions for other merchant acquirers and financial institutions, and operates an independent network called STAR. However, +60% of the company's EBITDA derive from the merchant space; and as we previously said, small- and medium-sized merchants generate the vast majority of acquiring revenue. Therefore, to understand FDC, it is necessary to understand how this environment has evolved over the past years.Merchant Acquiring Space - 2006Go back 10 years in time. Suppose you have a restaurant and you want to accept electronic payments from your customers. What do you do? Although you have some alternatives, the story usually follows this way:FDC would then split its profits with your bank under a previously designed profit sharing agreement and repeat the process. In this environment, customers have little choices and there is no price transparency, while merchant acquirers with vast distribution networks and entrenched joint venture partnerships have more chances to sign customers. In 2007, the private equity firm, KKR, saw a growing business with a highly recurring revenue stream, high margins and strong free cash generation in an industry levered to secular tailwinds, and proceeded with a $30 billion leveraged buyout.Merchant Acquiring Space - 2016Suppose you open a restaurant and you want to accept electronic payments. Maybe you still go to your bank to ask for advice, and maybe your bank will get you in contact with FDC. But before signing up anything, you'll probably Google the company. On the website CardPaymentOptions, you find out that First Data Corporation has a C- overall rating and a D on Complaints & Service, with ""hidden fees"" being the most common complaint. At the same website, there is an option to select the best merchant accounts by your line of business, so you select ""Restaurant"". Four companies with A+ ratings pop up. A common theme among them is transparency. For example, Dharma Merchant Services discloses its costs and pricing at the company's website. Host Merchant Services also emphasizes its transparent pricing policy:Sales Vu posts tutorial videos showing how the company's integrated, restaurant-oriented POS systems works. In short, you have plenty of interesting options to choose from. First Data Corporation is not among them.Industry Transformation and the Impact on FDCDuring the past ten years, a number of industry trends have played against FDC's core business model, including, among others: 1) decreasing transaction processing costs, which basically broke the industry's barrier to entry; 2) increasing customer empowerment and sophistication; 3) increasing demand for more payment options and industry-specific software; and 4) a shift to price transparency. Instead of leveraging its strong industry position to lead these changes, FDC stays on the sidelines. That is understandable considering that:a) When you have a pile of debt on your balance sheet that is eating your entire free cash flow on interest expenses, your strategic options are fairly limited.b) It is probably hard to turn off the customer milking machine and choose an uncertain path, especially when you have the certainty of a 4-year contractually guaranteed revenue stream in your hands.The combination of a) and b) resulted in the company choosing status quo. Yet, as Mark Zuckerberg would point out, taking no risks is a strategy that was guaranteed to fail. Since 2007, FDC has barely grown its top line (2.2% CAGR), while decreasing its revenue per transaction year over year:Note: Transactions from ""Global Business Solutions"" and ""Network Transactions"" add 69.147 billion in the 2015 10-K, yet in the February IR Presentation, the company states that it processed 79 billion global transactions in 2015. I'm using the numbers from the 10-K. Reimbursable items includes PIN debit fees, postage and other.Translating the above, FDC has been losing market share despite decreasing its prices and/or shifting to a less profitable sales/customer mix. As we previously said, this industry is tricky: maybe FDC loses a merchant to Dharma Merchant Services, but recovers part of the acquiring revenue lost by providing processing services to Dharma. Yet, the sweet money is gone. This tendency is further illustrated in the following table, where we can see that ""processing fees and other revenue from alliance partners"" has grown at more than 3 times the rate of acquiring revenue growth:Source: Company 10-KsBy the way, management re-organized the company's segments in 2015. With some effort, somewhere in the middle of the text describing Global Business Solutions' results, we can read that ""North American acquired revenue remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014"". In other words, the trend is not encouraging.What about switching costs? It seems that switching payment processing vendors has many disadvantages, such as transition costs, business disruption, etc. Well, in 2014, Wal-Mart shifted from using First Data as its sole North American processor to a dual processing strategy with Vantiv. If the biggest, yet very conservative retailer, made that choice is either because: a) switching costs are not that high, or b) the benefits outweighed the costs nonetheless. Whether it is a) or b), the lesson from this is that there is nothing preventing $2.5 billion of acquiring revenue from starting to going down.Management's Response and Competitive LandscapeIn the company's prospectus, CEO Frank Bisignano writes a letter stating that while he acknowledges that the company had many challenges when he joined (first half of 2013), First Data now offers investors ""the opportunity to join one of the most significant transformations in our industry"". First of all, we don't have data points pointing toward this ""significant transformation"". We don't know (at least from publicly disclosed information) important numbers such as customer attrition rates, % of customers that renew their contracts, % of revenues from old versus new customers, etc. If these numbers were high or improving, we would expect the management team to reveal them.Secondly, the numbers and examples that the management does put on the table as proof of this ""significant transformation"" are not very encouraging. Consider the following statements by CEO Frank Bisignano:Congratulations on STAR. Now, let's talk about the other 94% of your business:Clover is an open architecture, integrated POS software that the company acquired in December 2012 to ""help enhance client retention rates"" (10-K, 2015). The above statement by the CEO leaves many unknown questions, such as the number of units that were deployed in 2013 versus 2014 and 2015 (Bisignano was very explicit on STAR's year-over-year trends), but let's focus on the 150k. Even if those units were solicited by existing customers (which is big, if by the way), it is hard to feel ""very strong"" with that kind of outcome. Think about it for a second: after probably receiving dozens of emails about how Clover would change their lives, only 2.5% of the company's 6 million customers have ordered the product during the past three years.So the company is losing 200,000 (?) merchants in the US every year, yet the management team is proud about adding 40,000 merchants in Brazil, a country that is experiencing its worst economic recession during the past 80 years.When these are the ""good news"" that a management team puts on the table results, you're only left wondering what are the bad news they are hiding behind it.Last but not least, First Data is too indebted to succeed. Despite successfully refinancing its balance sheet, the company's 19.5 billion debt hole represents more net debt outstanding than the combined net debt of its non-bank, publicly traded peers across all its business lines. Financial flexibility translates into strategic flexibility as well. Vantiv, for example, can spend $1.6 billion to acquire Mercury Payments, a company that provides POS software applications. Ambitious companies such as Square or Intuit can grow their revenues at high-double digit rates. Big, well-capitalized banks can become more aggressive with their pricing strategy:As you can see above, JPMorgan's Paymentech is basically subsidizing part of a merchant's termination fee. So, assuming that a merchant has to pay $400 to terminate a contract with FDC and he/she changes to Paymentech, the effective termination fee becomes almost 40% lower. Good luck retaining that customer.Revenue Quality is DeterioratingJust as the quality of the business is deteriorating, so is the quality of FDC's reported revenues. In 2015, accounts receivable increased faster than sales. That alone doesn't mean much, but there are two reasons to look at this more deeply. First, this business has always been run with low incremental working capital needs. In fact, there is no other single year since 2009 when receivables increased faster than sales before:Source: Company 10-KsSecond, none of FDC's closest competitors (publicly traded non-bank merchant acquirers/processors) increased receivables faster than sales in 2015:Source: Company 10-KsTherefore, there has to be a reasonable explanation for this. The company's explanation is that the increase in accounts receivable was ""driven partly by shift in product / customer mix"" (4Q2015 IR Presentation, page 11). Yet, considering that the entire yoy increase took place in Q42015, this explanation is poor. On the contrary, these customer reviews offer more color (emphasis added):In case you're wondering whether these comments constitute the norm or the exception, according to the site Merchant Maverick, BBB compiled 1100 negative reviews of First Data, 321 of which have come in the past year alone. Clearly, there are many moving parts here, but maybe there is a positive correlation between the amount of negative reviews and the ratio of accounts receivables growth to sales growth. Besides that, when the company books $400 in cancellation fees from a customer, sales associated with that customer can increase 10x in that month (assuming the monthly charges were $40), and the company's EBITDA probably increases even more (since those $400 probably drop faster to the bottom line). Therefore, EBITDA can experience a short-term boost if attrition rates accelerate. Taking that into account, it would be interesting to know the amount of cancellation fees as a % of EBITDA, as well as the trend during the past years.Readjusting ""Adjusted EBITDA""In the 4Q15 IR presentation, there is a nice graph showing how FDC's ""adjusted EBITDA"" grew 7% yoy:Even if we ignore the abnormal yoy growth of the company's accounts receivable relative to sales, those $762 million are misleading for (at least) two reasons:a) Management's 4Q15 ""adjusted EBITDA"" includes $11 million from ""gains on the revaluation of U.S. dollar-denominated net assets in Argentina"". In December of 2015, the newly elected Argentinean government devalued the official exchange rate by 40% overnight, after ""unifying"" the multiple exchange rates that were present in the country. Since FDC uses the official exchange rate as its functional currency, the company experienced a one-time accounting gain resulting from the translation of U.S. dollar-denominated assets in Argentina. While the CFO acknowledges this is an unusual item in the last conference call, those $11 million are still included in management's ""adjusted EBITDA"" calculation.b) Management excludes stock-based compensation from ""adjusted EBITDA"". Stock-based compensation should be significant for a company that has decided that ""all employees would become owner-associates and have an equity stake in the future"", as the CEO states in the prospectus. And, in fact, it is significant. In Q415, the company recorded $298 million in stock-based compensation. According to the 10-K, $254 million of 2015's stock-based compensation expense is directly associated with the IPO. Therefore, the company incurred $44 million in recurring stock-based comp in Q415 versus $5 million in Q414.When taking a) and b) into account, re-adjusted EBITDA remained flat yoy.ValuationFDC is currently trading at a 7% unlevered FCF or at a 9.6% levered FCF yield on a 2015 pro forma basis:Note: The company had $429 million in cash and equivalents as of December 31 2015. $136 million was held by subsidiaries, and it is not available for corporate purposes, while the rest is used to fund ""short-term liquidity needs"" (2015 10-K). Therefore, I'm not including those $429 million in the EV calculation.Covenant EBITDA includes additions such as $100 million in KKR-related expenses, $50 million in restructuring expenses and $118 million in ""projected near-term cost savings and revenue enhancement"". It is worth recalling that FDC has been managed by a private equity firm during the past 8 years, so it is surprising that the company can still cut costs without impacting the sustainability of the business. Even so, a 9.6% levered FCF yield seems expensive for a company that is losing market share, decreasing its RPT and competing against more financially (and therefore, more strategically) flexible peers; while at the same time, the quality of reported revenues is deteriorating and management's adjusted numbers are dubious. Besides, there are other issues to consider as well:As you can see above, non-auto retail sales penetration was 65% when KKR acquired the company. Now, it should be close to 90%. Whenever the industry's growth rate converges to GDP growth, not only will transactions acquired/processed growth slow down, but we can reasonably expect that competition among industry participants will intensify as well. The ""double-whammy"" effect on the top line is especially problematic for a company whose revenues has barely grown during the industry's booming years.Considering the issues previously discussed, and that management did not provide guidance in the last conference call (by the way, that is not a good signal when your business is supposed to have a ""recurring revenue"" stream), in my opinion, the most down-to-earth approach to valuing the equity is putting a multiple to 2015 numbers. If the company were to trade at a generous 15% levered FCF yield on a 2015 pro forma basis, the stock has 34% downside to the current share price. That yield is generous because: a) it is far from being a melting ice cube type of yield; and b) we are taking the company's adjustments (KKR one-timers, restructuring initiatives, cost savings, etc.) at face value.RisksInvestors interested in shorting the equity should consider the following risks:Mitigant: Although customers are leaving First Data for multiple reasons, the most common theme that you read on online reviews is the company's high and hidden fees. Until the management team addresses that, it would be hard for FDC to effectively compete in today's marketplace, even if it had the best software in town (which is not the case).Mitigant: Although the bottom line will experience a short-term boost, competition will surely intensify. With big banks less willing to lend, you can certainty expect that they'll continue investing more money into other venues, such as merchant acquiring. Yet, this is the biggest risk of shorting the equity.Mitigant: Some industry analysts think that the high-single digits growth rates can come from further penetration in the small and micro ticket space, or from those +20 million merchants (depending who you ask) that so far don't accept card-based payments, but could be converting a mobile phone into a card-based reader. Square, Intuit and PayPal are dominating this space, so it is hard to think how FDC could take advantage of this trend.RemarksThe payments processing industry has been experiencing a paradigm shift across all its verticals, especially the merchant acquiring space. As with many shifts of this nature, winners and losers emerge. Although the outcome of this ongoing change is uncertain, FDC is emerging as a clear loser: its business model is too outdated to retain customers, and the company is too indebted to fight back. At the same time, while the management team states that the company is embarking in a ""significant transformation"", there is no evidence sustaining that. Furthermore, the fact that revenue quality is deteriorating and that management has to make misleading adjustments to show positive numbers could indicate that the company's problems are only getting worse. When combined with an increasingly competitive industry whose growth is steadily converting towards GDP growth, this is a stock that investors should avoid at the current price."

And I believe that they can manage to do this.","Back in January I wrote an article about the financial service provider Fiserv (NASDAQ: FISV) and its involvement in the FinTech sector. Since that time, the stock grew from $91/share to slightly above $100/share and continues to show strength:Source: BloombergLast Thursday, the company announced its earnings results for the first quarter of 2016, and I believe it's a great time to update my views about Fiserv and its involvement in growing sectors such as FinTech.A-Level PerformanceThe results for Q1 were successful for Fiserv and its internal revenue grew by 4% over the period to $1.33 billion and adjusted EPS increased by 19% to $1.06 year-over-year. Areas like card services, lending, e-payment and output solutions were among the best performers during the quarter and management expects to see an accelerated growth of these businesses throughout the rest of the year.Another important aspect, that makes Fiserv an even more attractive investment, is its ecosystem that has a diversified amount of products that suit different businesses from a wide variety of industries. This helps the company to build strategic relationships and enhance its services.It also heavily invests in innovation and is considered to be one of the leading players of the FinTech sector. Besides launching its own FinTech accelerator in partnership with Bank Innovation, Fiserv also acquired multi-channel payment and billing solution company Biller Solutions and finally completed its transaction of ACI Worldwide's (NASDAQ: ACIW) Financial Services unit. The management believes that those deals will contribute $75 million to $85 million of adjusted revenue in 2016, and that the real growth will begin in 2017.As for the existing businesses, Mobiliti ASP, which provides clients with Fiserv services via phone or tablet, increased a number of its subscribers by 40% Y/Y and 9% sequentially to more than 4.5 million users. And with the rise of mobile technology, the company is confident that the growth will continue in the coming quarters.Also, Fiserv's leading platform DNA slowly continues to grow and increases the number of its customers. As of March 30, the platform has more than 20 new clients, including 8 institutions with more than $1 billion in assets. And as the pipeline of services continues to increase and larger banks and credit unions are joining Fiserv ecosystem, the more competitive the company becomes and it makes it an even more attractive investment.As for the outlook, the company has quite conservative forecast for the 2016. It expects to remain its current revenue growth rate at 5-6% and believes that it can achieve 12-15% of adjusted EPS by the end of the period. And considering the great results for the first period, the goals are quite realistic. It's a ""Buy"" for me."

At the time, it was a data processing company which focused on providing data services for large financial institutions. To increase its presence in the field and crush its competition, Fiserv decided to develop a corporate acquisition strategy that will help it to strengthen its position in the data and banking industry.Over the last three decades, Fiserv acquired businesses and enterprises that were focused on developing services for processing data, electronic commerce, online banking, online bill payment, electronic bill payment, mobile banking, check clearance etc. These purchases helped the company to become one of the largest providers of financial services for large institutional accounts.But as the online technology evolves and FinTech sector is gaining traction, Fiserv plans to continue to increase its presence in this field and dominate the industry for the years to come.Fintech OverviewFinTech is a shortcut for financial technology. It's a business that is based on using software to provide financial services to different institutional and/or retail clients. The main advantage of the business is that it's easy to use, it offers a wide variety of products that you can purchase using the service and you don't need to carry cash every time you want to buy something. Here are the reasons why consumers are using FinTech:(Source: EY FinTech Adoption Index)According to Accenture (NYSE:ACN), global investment in financial technology tripled in 2014, with a 201% increase between 2013 and 2014, with approximately $12B invested through more than 730 deals. And besides the traditional financial giants like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), a lot of investments were being made by venture capital firms:(Source: Pitch Book)And it seems that the trend will continue and a lot of traditional financial services are at risk of being displaced by the new entrants.Disrupting through Acquisitions and PartnershipsFiserv survived a number of bubbles and recessions thanks to its corporate acquisition strategy that I described at the beginning of this article. The same thing the company does now to increase its presence in the FinTech sector. It buys small enterprises or startups that are disrupting the traditional financial industry by releasing their own financial technology services that are better than that of a competition. It also partners with big-name institutional investors that are interested in using these services in their business routines.First major acquisitions in FinTech sector for Fiserv occurred in 2011. At the time, the company purchased M-Com, a provider of mobile banking applications and bought CashEdge, a provider of online funds transfer services. Then in 2013, it acquired Open Solutions, their main asset of which was a DNA account processing platform which Fiserv integrated into its portfolio.However, the real expansion started this month. First Fiserv was chosen to deploy its technology for Suffolk Country National Bank to improve customer experience, then it partnered up with Alpha Payments Cloud to help the Australian banks to faster their way to process payments, and was selected by big British Columbian banks for deploying its DNA processing platform for their business.And then last week, Fiserv bought the Community Financial Services (CFS) arm of e-banking and payment solutions provider ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ: ACIW) and partnered with Bank Innovation to launch its own FinTech accelerator.The accelerator will play a huge part of Fiserv's future success in the FinTech sector. Thanks to the resources and partnerships that the company has, it can serve as a connection point between financial services startups and thousands of bank and credit union clients all around the world.Over the last few years, the stock price of Fiserv was rising at a moderate pace:(Source: Bloomberg)Also, the company quickly recovered after the recent market selloff and showed that it can be a safe bet for investors in a troubling time. And the reason why I believe that it will continue to grow is because it has decades of experience in the industry and willingness and ability to dig deep to understand what its clients want.Recent partnerships and a strong start to the year are indicating that Fiserv is strongly devoted to its mission of improving customer service and increasing its own shareholders value for the long-term."
3733916,24276,2015-12-04T11:43:55-05:00,"Payment processors like Visa are banks without the risk.Despite rich valuations, many are rising right now.Even First Data will do very well next year.","There are plenty of stocks dreading the prospect of a Fed rate hike, now widely expected. But there is one hot sector that is quite looking forward to it, payment processors. Most of the processors have been on fire this year. Vantiv (VNTV) is up 28%. Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) is up a whopping 48%. Visa (NYSE:V) is up nearly 17%.What has been driving the processors forward are the moves of consumers to using plastic in lieu of cash, even on small purchases, and the dominance of the ""big brands"" in the space, Visa and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). This has greatly benefited third-party processors like Heartland and Vantiv, whose business is to represent merchants in the transaction process.But there is now a new catalyst many investors don't properly appreciate at work, the interest rate rise. That is because processors, while charging banks discounts and per-transaction charges for their services, also handle the money in transactions between processing and settlement. They are, in effect, banks.This has not been a very big deal while interest rates were at zero, but it becomes a bigger deal as interest rates return to normal. Competition may keep consumer lenders like Capital One (NYSE:COF) from a wholesale rise in rates in the wake of the hike, but processors, investing millions of dollars at a daily rate that was just fractions of a fractions of a penny, now may be able to get more of that penny. And pennies add up, as anyone with a jar of old ones on the shelf will tell you.That's why both MasterCard and Visa are up 1.62% in early Friday trade, well ahead of the market, even though their valuations right now seem exceedingly high, with Visa trading at 31% last year's earnings and MasterCard at 30. As interest rates normalize further, you can expect further gains, not only from these two leaders, but also from other companies that do business directly with them.Take First Data (FDC) for instance. I called its IPO in October a flop, as it failed to hold its IPO price of $16 on the first day of trading, mainly because parent KKR (NYSE:KKR) had loaded it up with debt and sought the maximum price for the asset.But, as I also noted, this is a very good business to be in. First Data is the largest third-party processor out there, and by a wide margin. The stock is now over $17, an 8% premium over that IPO price, and headed higher as this was written. It has no net income yet, but it does have operating income, amounting to 10% of every dollar that came in the door during the most recent quarter. Get KKR off its back and this is a stock that will do well, and those margins will actually pick up next year after the Fed rate hike kicks in.Just remember this. Payment processing is banking. Only without the risks."
3609416,52712,2015-10-27T15:20:09-04:00,"First Data is a high growth, global electronic payments company.Company faces substantial competition in financial services, payments, and technology industry.Business is still not profitable and may not be profitable in next few years.Company is highly leveraged, with approximately $21 billion in debt.Investors in this stock are assuming major risks, which they are not being adequately compensated for.","Regardless of the size of the electronic payments industry and in spite of First Data Corporation's (FDC) ability to obtain market share within the sector, we are cautious on this stock given its high debt load, lack of profitability, and the intense competition within the sector.Source: Company Prospectus Business OverviewFirst Data operates in three core segments with each subject to intense competition. Their Global Business Solutions segment which provides POS services and eCommerce services faces competition from Paypal, Braintree, CyberSource, Ayden, Stripe, and Square to name a few. Businesses within this space compete primarily on brand, price, servicing capability, and strength of financial institution partnerships. There seems little reason to believe First Data can create any sustainable competitive advantage to stop competitors from pitching their existing business and will likely have to lower price and add additional services to continue to retain contracts with their customers. Additionally numerous of their competitors are securing large financing rounds to build scale, recently Stripe cemented a $5 billion dollar valuation.Within the Global Financial Solutions and Network Security businesses First Data provides additional value added services to clients. These businesses primarily competes on price, servicing capability, and data security. Ultimately none of these criteria seem to be competitive moats around the business, as they can relatively easily be copied by competitors. For instance Square in its IPO prospectus discusses all the state of the art security which it employs in its payment processing.Additionally, this company has a very high debt load, $21 billion as of recent quarter. This puts a lot of strain on the business, with the company having to spend a substantial amount of its cash flows to repay the principal and interest on their debt(see below). This high debt ratio increases the businesses susceptibility to adverse economic and industry developments. High debt may also affect the company's competitive position as it may be unable to pursue relevant acquisitions and/or capital expenditures given its cash flow may be consumed by interest. This high interest expense is also contributing to the company's continued losses.Finally we examined the valuation multiples for First Data versus its online payment processing peer group. Peers were chosen within the online payments space with similar growth profiles and business models. First Data trades relatively in line with its peer set in terms of its trading multiples and thus there does not appear to be an impetus to purchase the stock as an undervalued business.Source: CapitalIQ/Author AnalysisSource: Company ProspectusSource: Author AnalysisOverall given the intense competition within the online payment processing industry, First Data's high debt load, and a valuation in line with its peers, investors should be cautious when considering First Data. With limited competitive moats, First Data will likely fall into pricing and advertising/marketing battles going forward with its competitors. Although there is obviously a lot of growth going forward in the online payments sector, we see this as a stock to avoid purchasing until some of these issues are better addressed through strong execution as a public company or a pullback where the valuation thereby compensates investors for these risks."
3822456,66213,2016-01-20T17:25:20-05:00,"First Data released Clover Go which will compete with the Square chip card reader.They also have teamed up with SAP SE to improve B2B payment processing through AribaPay.Although they are sitting on a pile of debt, their sound operating fundamentals and future opportunities make this stock a good long-term buy.","First Data (NYSE:FDC) is and has a solid history of functioning as a quality company. Operationally, they are one of the best around with an operating margin of 13.1%. And as the leader in payment processing with a reach to more than 6 million merchants, why was the IPO a failure, and why is investor interest so weak?To start, First Data's IPO had unfortunate timing. 2015 was weak for IPOs compared to 2014 with 106 less deals happening. IPO proceeds raised in 2015 were the lowest in over six years. So right out of the gate First Data faced a cold and uninviting market, having to price their IPO at $16 per share, which was less than their projected $18-$20 estimates. And since then the stock has tumbled with the rest of the market.DebtThere is only one word that can sum up investor fear and disinterest in First Data - debt. Ever since KKR (NYSE:KKR) took First Data private via a heavily leveraged buyout back in 2007 their balance sheet has never been the same. They currently have nearly $21 billion of long-term debt sitting on their books, cutting into their net margins, and destroying stockholder equity. With the heavy interest expense cutting their 13.1% operating margin into a -2.2% net margin, investors have a right to wonder if the company will ever be able to pay off their debt and create value.GrowthEveryone knows that when you're the biggest in your industry it is much harder to stimulate significant growth compared to your smaller competitors. That is the dilemma that First Data faces. With nearly $11.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, First Data is facing a significantly slower growth rate compared to their smaller competitors. And if they grow their top line by only 3% YOY, it's going to take quite a while to turn a positive bottom line. So where can they gain some growth?Clover GoFirst Data recently announced the availability of Clover Go to add to their Clover platform which they acquired in December 2012. The Clover Go will compete more directly with Square (NYSE:SQ), as it is designed for businesses on the go. The card reader plugs into an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Android tablet and can then process payments with WiFi or cellular connection after they have downloaded the app. First Data has already competed against Square with their Clover Station against the Square Stand with success. The Clover Go gives First Data the ability to tap a newer market for them and open the door to some growth within their hardware sales.Source: Firstdata.comAribaPaySAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and First Data just announced that they've joined forces to create simplicity and improve the efficiency of business-to-business payments through AribaPay. The service will help companies across Europe and Latin America make and receive B2B payments quicker, with reduced fraud risk and lower costs. First Data was the obvious partner for this and is the obvious choice to lead the changes in the payment processing industry because of their size and $1.9 trillion of processing per year. So, as the industry evolves I believe more doors will open for First Data to make partners with the leaders in technology who want to play a role in the evolving industry.ConclusionFirst Data is a long way away from cleaning up their balance sheet, however the company has very sound operating fundamentals. And while their growth rate is slow, being the dominant company in payment processing makes them a target partner for tech companies who are trying to make a footprint in the payment processing industry. Not only is First Data growing their cloud-based hardware payment processing line through Clover, they are teaming up to try and capitalize on the changes on the software and security sides as well. Nevertheless, $21 billion is a lot of debt to swallow and it won't go away any time soon. But with First Data's sound fundamentals and large footprint in an evolving industry, they will eventually get there."
3577666,24276,2015-10-16T09:39:05-04:00,KKR brought First Data to market loaded with debt.It asked too much for too little in equity.This should be a great business.,"The failure of First Data (FDC) to hold its IPO price (it closed at $15.75) comes down to one word.Debt.On the surface, this one should have flown off the shelves. Other third-party credit card processors have been on fire this year. Heartland Payment (HPY) is up 24%. Vantiv (VNTV) is up 35%. Total Systems Services (NYSE:TSS) is up 42%.This is a hot area because electronic payments are taking over from cash in every sphere. An electronic processor makes money with every transaction and gets to hold the merchant's money until the transaction clears. Whether a buyer presents a credit card, a set of numbers on their PC, or uses something like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, merchant processors usually get a piece of the action.But First Data, while the largest such processor, is different from the others. Thanks to KKR (NYSE:KKR), it's coming to the market crippled by debt. The S-1 showed $20.6 billion in ""long-term borrowings,"" on $34 billion in assets, nearly twice the debt-to-assets ratio of companies like Total, Heartland and Vantiv.KKR took First Data private in 2007 and figured that processing was just like any other stable consumer-oriented business, like Budweiser (NYSE:BUD) or Tim Horton's (NYSE:QSR). The idea was that you could load the balance sheet with debt, buy the company with its own money, then squeeze out costs to pay down that debt, maximizing the equity value, and sell it back to the public at a huge profit.But the business is not that stable. While processing is done with computers and networks, the technology landscape is constantly changing. You can't just move customers from a mainframe to a cloud. The freeway has to run, while you're making the transition - the move has to be transparent.The nature of the business for decades has been that banks would lead customers to independent agencies that set them up with processors and equipment. This meant every deal was a banking deal. Each deal was different, with different terms, different technology, and different details on the back end.The rise of companies like Square, which offer the same deal to all customers, has brought more volume to the business, but it has also threatened those long-standing sales relationships. It's not a business that stands still, in other words, not where it's sold and not where it's transacted.First Data has, by all reports, been a solid competitor, and has bought advanced technology like Gyft, which allows gift cards to be managed through smartphones. Like many rivals it has expanded globally, and it has worked to strengthen its basic platform.But all this has cost money, and it hasn't always gone smoothly. Current CEO Frank Bisignano, once a top lieutenant to JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, is a wheeler and dealer, not a technologist, and it showed during the roadshow and in interviews, where he basically read a script from public relations and couldn't discuss the opaque inner workings of his business.The IPO valued First Data at $14 billion, which is almost twice what its smaller rivals are worth and seems reasonable. But even after putting the proceeds of the IPO in the bank, the company will still have $18.4 billion in borrowings, some of it at rates as high as 12%. Most of the other processors fell slightly going into the IPO, but recovered during the day. Their shareholders are breathing a sigh of relief today.This should have been a great deal, but KKR loaded it with debt and charged shareholders too much for too little equity. They got greedy and paid the price.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

Proceeds from the IPO were to be used to repay debt, but with shares priced lower, less debt will be repaid.A disappointing IPO is bad news for KKR which retains an 82.3% stake in the payments processing company. With high debt and competition, FDC could continue to hurt KKR's performance.","The highly anticipated IPO of First Data Corp. (FDC) is turning into a major disappointment for investors as the stock fails to hold its initial offering price. Not only is the performance of this stock disappointing for investors who received shares of FDC from the IPO offering, the botched deal also bodes ill for shareholders of KKR (NYSE:KKR), the private equity company which owns the majority of First Data.A Challenged IPO TransactionKKR has had a tough time pitching First Data to prospective investors. While the giant payment processing company cleared an astounding $1.7 trillion in payments in 2014, First Data still generated a loss due to the company's huge debt load.Investors have been told to expect significant growth from First Data, as the company's debt load is expected to be reduced to ""only"" $18.4 billion following the IPO transaction.KKR and First Data expect to use proceeds from the IPO transaction to pay down about $2.5 billion in debt. This debt repayment was estimated by the company based on an expected IPO price of $19. It remains to be seen how much of the debt will be repaid since First Data was priced at a discount price of $16.First Data was taken private by KKR in 2007 with a price tag of $30 billion. At today's IPO price of $16, the company is being valued near $14 billion. This valuation plus the $18 billion in debt may allow KKR to turn a profit on the deal, but with the stock failing to hold the $16 price point, KKR is still very much at risk. After the IPO, KKR will still be the majority owner of FDC, and if the stock continues to trade lower, KKR's remaining position will decline in value.Based on the lackluster reception to this deal, and the company's challenged business position, we're worried that First Data could have farther to fall before finding support.The Symbolic Importance of FDC's IPOThe success of this week's First Data IPO is very important to KKR and its investors. The sale of 160 million shares at a price of $16 represents a $2.6 billion dollar transaction, the biggest IPO of the year.But the deal is actually much bigger than the transaction size when it comes to KKR's unrealized profits. This is because following the IPO transaction, there will be roughly 902 million ""fully diluted"" shares of FDC in float, with about 82.3% of the company still held by KKR.Shares of FDC were sold to the public at $16 per share, which represents a discount to the original expected range of $18 to $20 per share. So even at the IPO price, the deal was already a disappointment to KKR stakeholders watching the deal.Now that the stock is actively trading, the value of KKR's remaining investment in the company will fluctuate based on the market price for FDC. If shares of FDC continue to trade below the IPO price of $16, KKR will be required to report a declining unrealized value for its remaining shares of FDC.This is why we previously stated that the First Data IPO was a significant indicator for private equity companies. The fact that FDC had to be priced at the low end of its range shows us that investor demand for newly issued stocks may not be as strong as private equity companies had hoped. And with this current ""soft demand"" environment, it will be more difficult for private equity companies to sell other positions through IPO transactions.The good news is that weak market prices will allow private equity companies like The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) to buy companies at distressed prices, setting themselves up for attractive gains in the future. This week's earnings report from Blackstone indicated that private equity companies are currently able to successfully raise capital for new investment opportunities.But the First Data IPO shows us that it is currently a buyer's market rather than a seller's market when it comes to acquiring new investments or capitalizing on positions through IPO transactions.Where Could FDC Trade From Here?Over the next few weeks, shares of FDC will likely fall under pressure. This is largely because of the mechanics for how IPO transactions take place.In the case of First Data's IPO, there were more than a dozen underwriting brokerages tasked with distributing shares to their clients. As a general rule, these brokerages help to support the IPO price by purchasing shares in the open market. That is likely why FDC has not moved more than about 20 cents below the $16 IPO price.When the underwriters stop supporting the shares, however, the stock price is left to fluctuate according to supply and demand dynamics. And since investors who bought at the IPO price of $16 are now sitting on losses, we expect selling pressure to pick up. This will likely happen over the next few weeks.Looking farther down the road, FDC investors will buy and sell shares based on the fundamental outlook for the company. It's difficult to predict a reliable earnings per share forecast for FDC because the company's capital structure is in flux. (Shares are being sold and capital raised will be used to pay down debt.)The few analysts that cover FDC currently project 2016 earnings near $1.00 per share. This will likely be adjusted as more analysts begin to cover the stock. But at its current level, shares of FDC are trading just below 16 times forward estimates.This valuation will likely contract as the company carries significant risk. This risk comes both from the high level of debt the company carries as well as the significant competition First Data faces. Large payment processors Total Systems (NYSE:TSS) and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) have seen steadily increasing revenues, and smaller upstart payment processors such as Square may cut into First Data's growth prospects.In short, we're not optimistic for First Data investors. And the disappointing IPO has us re-evaluating our opinion on KKR. For now, we would avoid shares of FDC, avoid KKR (which still holds a majority stake in FDC) and we would lean toward investing in The Blackstone Group."
3636906,21798,2015-11-03T08:34:32-05:00,"Fiserv continues to benefit from industry trends.
        The stock looks close to fairly valued on a DCF basis.
        I expect the stock to trend higher from here as the company continues its strong growth.","Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. The company has benefited from multiple trends, which are likely to continue heading into the future. Although the stock's valuation is above average, it is justified by Fiserv's above average growth. I think that Fiserv will continue to perform well due to the value that it brings to its customers.Trends to Catalyze Fiserv's GrowthIncreased regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will continue to impact the financial industry. Slow economic growth is another factor that impacts the industry. Financial-based companies are seeking new ways to retain and gain customers and to increase revenue in the face of these trends. These companies look to Fiserv for solutions to these challenges. Fiserv's electronic payments solutions are a way for financial companies to retain and increase customers.Fiserv helps companies manage customer relationships and to market to new customers by using the latest technology. For example, Fiserv enables financial companies to manage its customers via branches, online and mobile channels. Some of the company's solutions include:1. Teller applications that optimize efficiency at branches2. Account aggregation services, which enables customers to get a comprehensive portfolio view of all of their financial accounts3. Secure electronic billing and payment solutions to meet the demands of customers who prefer online transactions4. Lending solutions - Fiserv enables its customers to efficiently originate and service loans, thus reducing costs and boosting revenue for those financial institutions.5. Marketing - Fiserv offers full-service marketing solutions which includes strategizing & designing a campaign, implementation, measurement, reporting and targeting using a variety of advertising types (direct mail, email, mobile, social media, etc.)Fiserv's solutions help financial companies to maximize revenue and minimize costs in the current regulated environment and in the face of sluggish economic growth. The company also provides tools so that its customers can analyze data to maximize the effectiveness of customer communication. This leads to better customer retention, allows customers to lower expenses, gives customers the ability to budget accurately, and create the ability to make better decisions. So, Fiserv is likely to gain new customers as its reputation expands in the industry as a business partner that can help improve the top and bottom lines of its clients.Another challenge facing the financial industry is lower lending volumes along with rising costs. I think that Fiserv does an effective job of offering its clients outsourcing services to help lower costs. For example, routine, back-office processes such as credit/debit card servicing, account processing, lending, and treasury management can be outsourced with Fiserv's outsourcing services. Through outsourcing, Fiserv enables its clients to lower costs and reap the benefits of having more predictable operational expenses. I think that this is likely to attract additional clients.I think that Fiserv will continue to thrive in this environment as financial companies turn to the company to help solve the challenges of growing in a highly regulated environment and a sluggish economy. Fiserv has increased earnings at nearly 14% annually over the past five years. Consensus estimates are calling for Fiserv to grow earnings at 13% annually for the next five years. That above average growth is likely to drive the stock price higher over the next five years.ValuationThe stock is currently trading at 22X next year's expected earnings per share [EPS] of $4.32. Although that is higher than the S&P 500's forward PE of 17, Fiserv's consistent above average earnings growth justifies a higher valuation. The PEG ratio of 1.9 is still below two, where I like it. However, I would prefer to see the PEG below 1.5.Fiserv is a consistent grower of operating and free cash flow. Therefore, it would be appropriate to do a discounted cash flow [DCF] analysis to determine the company's intrinsic value. I used the market's historical annual rate return of 10% as the discount rate since that is the rate that we aim to beat.The assumptions are that Fiserv will grow free cash flow at 13% annually for the next five years. The free cash flow growth assumptions are approximately in-line with expected earnings growth. Fiserv has a tendency to grow free cash flow at a rate that is equal to or even greater than its earnings growth over multiple years.Then, we assumed that free cash flow would grow at 10% annually for years 6 - 10 and 3% annually thereafter. The 10% annual growth assumption takes the maturation of the business into consideration along with increased competition over time. The DCF calculations show that Fiserv has an intrinsic value of about $106. So, the stock is trading slightly below fair valuation as the current price is $96.77.The RisksThe largest challenge for the company is growing in the face of competition. Some of Fiserv's competitors include: Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ:ACIW), Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), Total Systems Services (NYSE:TSS), and NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR). Fiserv has done a great job of remaining competitive, but the company will need to continue to understand and adapt to the needs of its customers to continue its growth. Given the large amount of financial companies available to serve, Fiserv is likely to continue to get its piece of the pie in this space. Fiserv's competitive advantage is its strong long-term client relationships. These strong relationships will help the company generate repeat business as well as lead to new business from additional financial companies who strive to reap the benefits of operational efficiencies.The stock is facing an overbought condition, so a correction is due. However, any corrections are likely to be short-term. Therefore, I would rather focus on the long-term which looks positive for the company.ConclusionThe benefits for Fiserv are likely to outweigh its challenges. The company has navigated well in the current environment and I think it will continue to do so, given its solid track record. The company's solutions for growing and maintaining customers in the financial industry have proven to be effective. Fiserv has a good track record of meeting/exceeding its earnings estimates. Given the company's near fair valuation on a DCF basis, I think that the stock can increase approximately in-line with earnings growth going forward. This will allow the stock to increase approximately 13% annually over the next five years."

The company is the largest merchant acquirer, issuer processor, and independent network services provider in the world, enabling businesses to accept electronic payments, helping financial institutions issue credit, debit and prepaid cards, and routing secure transactions between them.In 2014, FDC processed 74 billion transactions globally, or over 2,300 per second, and processed 28% of the world's eCommerce volume. In its largest market, the United States, FDC acquired $1.7 trillion of payment volume, accounting for nearly 10% of U.S. GDP last year.Three primary lines of businessThe company is organized around three primary lines of business:Global Business Solutions (GBS) - This segment provides retail point-of-sale merchant acquiring and eCommerce services as well as next-generation offerings such as mobile payment services, webstore-in-a-box solutions, and the company's cloud-based Clover point-of-sale operating system, which includes a marketplace for proprietary and third-party business apps.Global Financial Solutions (GFS) - This segment provides credit solutions for bank and non-bank issuers. These include credit and retail private-label card processing within the United States and international markets, as well as licensed financial software systems, such as its VisionPLUS bank processing application, and lending solutions. GFS also provides financial institutions with a suite of related services including card personalization and embossing, statement printing, client service, and remittance processing.Network & Security Solutions (NSS) - This segment provides a wide range of value-added solutions that FDC sells to clients in its GBS and GFS segments, smaller financial institutions, and other enterprise clients. These solutions include the company's EFT network solutions, such as its STAR Network, its debit card processing solutions, its stored value network solutions, such as Money Network, ValueLink, Gyft, and Transaction Wireless, and its security and fraud solutions, such as TransArmor and TeleCheck. This segment also supports the company's other digital strategies, including online and mobile banking, and its business supporting mobile wallets.Intellectual propertyFDC owns a global portfolio of many trademarks, trade names, patents, and other intellectual property that are important to its future success. The only intellectual property rights that are individually material to the company are the First Data trademark and trade name, and the STAR trademark and trade name. The STAR trademark and trade name are used in the Network & Security Solutions segment. The First Data trademark and trade name are associated with quality and reliable electronic commerce and payments solutions. Financial institutions and merchants associate the STAR trademark and trade name with quality and reliable debit network services and processing services.Loss of the proprietary use of the First Data or STAR trademarks and trade names or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with these names could harm the growth of FDC's businesses.CompetitionFDC's Global Business Solutions segment competes with merchant acquirers that include Vantiv (VNTV), Worldpay, Global Payments (NYSE:GPN), and Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), in addition to financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services to businesses on their own, such as Chase Paymentech Solutions, Elavon (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), and Barclaycard.In many cases, FDC's alliance and commercial partners compete against each other.Additionally, payment networks such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are increasingly offering products and services that compete with FDC's suite of solutions.Competitors of FDC's next-generation services include PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Braintree (a subsidiary of PayPal), CyberSource (a subsidiary of Visa Inc.), Adyen, and Stripe, along with integrated point of sale providers such as Micros, NCR, Square, ShopKeep, Revel, and others.FDC's Global Financial Solutions segment competes with card issuer processors, such as Total System Services, Vantiv, Fidelity National Information Services, Fiserv, Worldline, Equens, and SIX Payment Services, as well as the card issuer processing businesses of the global payment networks such as UnionPay Data.In addition, FDC competes with various software or custom-designed solutions that some financial institutions use to perform services in-house.FDC's Network & Security Solutions segment competes with networks such as Visa, MasterCard, and Discover (NYSE:DFS) for debit network services, and with Fidelity National Information Services for debit network and check verification and guarantee services.FDC also faces competition from regional operators of debit networks. The company's portfolio of analytics, information, security and risk management solutions competes with a wide range of providers across multiple disciplines, including Visa, MasterCard, Voltage, Verisk, Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, and Fair Isaac.5% shareholders pre-IPONew Omaha Holdings L.P. 75%DividendsNo dividends are initially planned.Use of proceedsFDC expects to receive $2.9 billion from its IPO and use it for the following:to redeem all $510 million aggregate principal amount of its 11.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021, approximately $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 12.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021, and to pay applicable premiums and related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.Disclaimer: This FDC IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of FDC's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

3807506,91045,2016-01-13T09:29:01-05:00,Post-IPO performance is disappointing.High debt levels threaten the company.Increased tech M&A could boost up First Data stock.,"Payment processing company First Data (NYSE: FDC) released the biggest IPO of 2015 after eight years and a nearly $30 billion investment by KKR (NYSE:KKR). Such an investment was a large bet made by the private equity giant, with much seasoned experience in leveraged buyouts. After an additional cash injection of $1.2 billion in 2014, KKR finally saw a return on its hefty investment with the release of First Data's IPO.Shares of First Data has had a disappointing post-IPO performance, however.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Shares continued to struggle in the given market environment and is trading well below its IPO price of $16/share. The company, though, was able to post its first quarterly profit in Q4 2014 after nearly seven years, showing signs of a turnaround finally:(Source: First Data)First Data, however, continues to be burdened by a heavy debt level, with a major debt maturity in 2017. Inconsistent revenue and EBITDA puts significant pressure on First Data to meet these debt payments.(Source: First Data)Q4 results will ultimately show how profitable First Data is in its first months since IPO. Promising results are not overly expected, as the company continues to struggle with a real breakthrough in profitability. Additionally, their debt overwhelmingly outweighs their total assets at 60.91.First Data has another major challenge as well. The growing number of payment startups and First Data's struggle with profitability continue to negatively affect the stock and drive it down. Bankruptcy will continue to be on the horizon for this company as these debt payments weigh both the stock and the company down.Could M&A Activity Revive First Data?One hopeful factor that could revive First Data stock and put it on a bullish streak is the increase of M&A activity in the tech sector. Currently, as shown below, 38% of pending deals occurs in the tech & communications industry.(Source: Bloomberg)This increase in deal activity could boost up the tech industry and restore stability in a market where a multitude of factors have created a generous amount of volatility. Increased M&A would provide more liquidity to the tech market and help companies, including First Data, to remain profitable and avoid bankruptcy. Should First Data grow further and acquire smaller payment startups, they would be able to increase their market share and thus help KKR realize an actual decent return on their investment, as KKR still owns approximately 60% of the company.However, this all depends on First Data being able to accomplish two things. First, the company needs to be able to successfully report a profitable fourth quarter and ride out the current sell-off in the market. Secondly, they need to be able to meet their debt obligations as their current free cash flow is not overly-impressive.Overall, a long position in First Data could be decent, but the company needs to address a few factors for investors to achieve short-term profitability. The stock is trading well below its initial IPO price and its overall profitability and heavy debt payments is hurting shares of FDC."
3509386,61281,2015-09-14T15:57:03-04:00,"Payment giant First Data is about to go public to raise money to repay some of its senior 2021 notes.With a single-digit growth rate, no dividends and uncertainty about capital restructuring, investors should avoid this IPO.Square expected IPO and PayPal may serve as reasonable alternatives for a First Data investment.","Payment processing giant First Data (Pending:FDATA) is reportedly on its way back to the public market after an eight-year absence since private equity fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (NYSE:KKR) took it private in 2007. First Data is responsible for most of the action behind the scenes of the payment processing market as it transacts cash between payment processors, credit cards and banks in a process that is totally seamless for the merchant or consumer.First Data generates revenues from three business lines:As shown in Chart 1 below, most of the company's revenues are generated by the GBS segment, which also contributes the most to the company's EBITDA as reflected in the 2014 figures.First Data was one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in history when KKR acquired the company for almost $30B, which was financed with $24B of debt. The company still carries $21B of debt on its books, which has cost it almost $2B in interest expenses and other fees each year. This debt-related spending drove First Data's net loss of $265M in 2014 and served as a stop sign for many investors concerned about the company's ability to become profitable. IPO proceeds will be used to repay senior notes that are due in 2021 and have interest rates above 11% as part of a broad plan to restructure First Data's capital and improve its profitability and FCF.The restructuring process started in 2014 when the company used the proceeds of private placement of its parent company, First Data Holdings, and refinanced some of the company's debt, reducing interest expenses by $200M. According to its prospectus, First Data will continue executing this throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016.As shown in Chart 2 below, First Data's revenues and operating profits are stable while the company struggles to narrow its net loss.Enormous debt, small single-digit growth rates of its top line, EBITDA figures and lack of dividend policy all make the First Data IPO one to avoid for most investors. Those looking for deep-value stocks may claim First Data's stock will soar in a few years once the capital restructuring plan is over, and e-commerce rises. Even though these claims might be correct, I would prefer to see the end result or at least a sign of the end result of the process that indicates whether the company succeeded in reducing its debt-related payments and breaking even. I believe that the checkpoint for investors to decide whether First Data is on track will come up at the beginning of 2016.Investors interested in the growth of payment processing might find it in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or the expected Square IPO. Even though PayPal's stock didn't quite take off after its spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the company presents a 23% year-over-year valuation, impressive transaction volume increases, and a number of very appealing growth drivers that became available after the separation from eBay. I believe that PayPal is currently undervalued and is being traded at a significant discount from its true value, and this is why I'm currently holding the stock.Square is another growth story with an impressive 50% revenue growth year-over-year according to previously published research. Unlike PayPal, Square dominates electronics payments for brick-and-mortar stores and has replaced traditional payment processing services in these locations. Moreover, Square provides additional insight and business services to create a comprehensive commerce management platform for merchants. According to my calculations as described in the Square research, the company's P/S ratio is 18.9 and PayPal's P/S ratio is currently 4.8. Both are attractive investments that are expected to yield significant growth and don't have a $20B debt weight around their necks the way First Data does.ConclusionPayment processing company First Data is about to go public soon. It's seeking to raise $2.5B to repay a couple of senior notes that are due in 2021 and carry interest rates above 11%. The IPO is a step toward restructuring the company's capital and reducing its debt-related expenses created by the LBO that occurred eight years ago. Together with a very low top line growth rate and a lack of dividend policy, the capital restructuring process is expected to continue until mid-2016. Investors have no incentive to buy into this IPO when the growth potential is low. Investors should reassess First Data at the beginning of 2016 as its restructuring plan is nearing its end and they should consider Square or PayPal in the meantime."
3548646,94046,2015-10-02T15:40:03-04:00,"The payment processing sector is a hot area and is likely to bring the biggest IPO of the year if market volatility remains subdued.A rather conservative valuation may signal that KKR is betting on a takeover offer for First Data at a later stage as it needs to cut debt now.First Data IPO will test the market appetite for Square, which is the next candidate in the payment processing arena.","The fourth quarter has just started yet the payment processing sector has already caught the attention of tech investors following the announcement of the launch of an IPO for First Data (PENDING: FDATA) (FDC).The deal, which values its equity at up to $17.5bn based on the indicative IPO price range of $18-$20 a share, could end up being the largest IPO of 2015 - unless Square steals its thunder.The Silicon Valley payments firm founded by Jack Dorsey is the next big candidate in a sector where all the major tech firms in the US and elsewhere - Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Samsung (OTC: OTC:OTC:SSNLF) - are playing hard ball, committing billions to grow market share in a flash.BuyoutFirst Data was bought out by private equity firm KKR (NYSE: KKR) for $29bn in April 2007. That LBO took place only a couple of months before the jumbo debt package backing the LBO of Alliance Boots was pulled from the loan market. The first symptoms of the credit crunch that led to the demise of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 had already started to show in those days - the collapse of hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns and led by Ralph Cioffi and Mathew Tannin should ring a bell, followed by funds of France's BNP Paribas.KKR's timing was particularly poor. It will take a few more years now to exit its investment in First Data, which will likely remain one of the largest LBOs in history for a long time. Its IPO, however, testifies to a rather conservative pricing and to the need of its owner to realign the capital structure of the firm - which should arguably carry less debt and more equity - before trimming its holding.KKR will retain a majority stake but will use proceeds of up to $3.2bn to cut First Data's heavy debt load - this valuation is based on 160m shares outstanding at IPO and excludes an overallotment option of 24m shares.One side element that also is pretty important for investors is that the valuation of First Data could render it a more palatable takeover target. There could be a lesson here for Square management, too.MetricsFirst Data carries $19.7bn of net debt on its books, which implies net leverage of 7.4 times pre-money, based on its trailing 2014 EBITDA of $2.66bn. Unsurprisingly, the group plans to bring down net leverage to a more reasonable level - proceeds will be used to redeem $510m of 11.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021 as well as $2bn of 12.625% senior unsecured notes due 2021. If its IPO is successful, net leverage will drop to 6.4x on a pro-forma basis, according to my calculations.The deal would give First Data an enterprise value (EV) of between $35.5bn and $37.2bn for an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of between 13.6x and 14.3x, which drops to between 12.2x and 12.9x in 2015 assuming annual adjusted EBITDA grows in line with last year (it could be lower, though, based on 1H15 results).Its price-to-adjusted net earnings (adjusted P/E) for 2014 is almost 36x, but $1.6bn of interest costs weigh on its bottom line annually, while net losses are narrowing and their run-rate for 2015 comes in at $60m (versus $265m one year earlier).Consider that if interest costs fall at a faster pace or if First Data grows beating expectations over the next few quarters, its relative valuation based on adjusted P/E multiples could become much more enticing. The business reported a solid 23.8% adjusted EBITDA margin - up 110 basis points in 2014 over 2013 - and has recorded a two-year compound annual growth rate for revenues of 2.1%.KKR might have decided to play it safe to draw the attention of would-be suitors with the aim to boost its internal rate of return at a later stage, which would make sense over the medium term - we will find out how it plays out after the first round of book-building.ValuationFirst Data could open the door to one of the most debated IPO candidates in the sector in the US - namely, Square. Financials are sketchy, and Square is a hard nut to crack, but an announcement could be due any day now. Only three years ago, Square raised $200m from investors, which reportedly gave the firm a valuation of $3.25bn. We are almost blind on financials, but let's take a calculated guess on how its valuation could look like.It reportedly generated $170m in 2012, which could mean that Square sold a 6.1% equity stake back then, valuing its equity at almost 20 times revenue (I assume the reported valuation is based on zero net debt, although the company is thought to have some undrawn credit facilities on its books).In 2011, several reports suggested that Square had raised $100m, which implied the sale of a 6% stake and a valuation of $1.6bn for the firm, but also a stunning revenue multiple of 37.7 times based on revenues of $42.5m for that year.Square has already privately filed under the Jobs Act, so its revenue must be lower than $1bn. Based on press reports that indicate a valuation of up to $6bn, Square's equity would command a 12 times revenue multiple based on certain assumptions for the amount of cash that it processed this year (say $40bn), associated net margins (just over 1%) and a steady 45% growth rate for revenues to over $500m between 2013 and the end of this year. Remember: we are in best-guess territory.The higher the valuation of Square at IPO, the less likely a takeover of the firm will become, and that could be a problem for investors who decide to commit to it, particularly because uncertainty reportedly surrounds trends for its net income and underlying profitability. A strong response from the market for the IPO of First Data will certainly signal what kind of valuation Square should so go for - hoping that volatility stays low after a few rocky weeks and doesn't spoil its plan.A more mature business, First Data could be valued at up to 3.6 times revenue today, including net debt. Frankly, I would wait a couple of quarters to invest in its stock. But First Data could be a decent bet on consolidation in the industry, particularly if its net leverage drops to around 4 times."
3065746,63483,2015-04-13T09:21:53-04:00,"User base for P2P payments & mobile banking solutions continues to grow, supported by secular tailwinds. Bolt-on acquisition strategy continues.High customer switching costs, large customer base, limited customer concentration, and long-term contracts will allow for customer retention and stable recurring cash flows.Further margin expansion likely due to a highly scalable and relatively capital-light business model.Liquidity remains intact, rate hike should be a net positive, introduction of NOW, Swift-Fiserv Australian collaboration.DCF indicates that slight upside from current levels.","Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) provides financial institutions with technology solutions, primarily account and payment processing systems. The company's user base for P2P (person-to-person) payments network and mobile banking solutions continues to grow, supported by secular tailwinds. The fin-tech provider has continued its bolt-on acquisition strategy, most recently with the acquisition of Open Solutions. High customer switching costs, a large customer base, limited customer concentration, and long-term contracts will allow for customer retention and stable recurring cash flows going forward. Further margin expansion is possible due to the company's adoption of a highly scalable and capital-light business model. The firm's liquidity remains intact, and the Fed's upcoming rate hike should be a net positive for Fiserv. The company's introduction of its NOW network seems very promising, along with its collaboration with Swift in the overhaul of the Australian's payments infrastructure.User base for P2P payments & mobile banking solutions continue to grow, aided by secular tailwindsThe company's release of its P2P payments network, known as Popmoney, continues to be enticing for financial institutions and consumers alike. It provides consumers with the convenience of sending and receiving money, while allowing financial institutions to generate recurring transaction-based revenue as consumers continue to use the platform. In the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Jeff Yabuki announced that the company added over 300 financial institutions to its Popmoney network, with the total user base numbering almost 2400. The continued growth in the company's user base for P2P payments is also significant as it shows that users of its network continue to be loyal and perhaps have familiarized themselves with the network. If consumers were not using the network, financial institutions would abandon Popmoney for another competing solution. Therefore, the key thing to note for the company's P2P payments solution is whether its user base experiences declines. Considering Fiserv serves over 14,500 financial institutions globally, there is still massive room available to grow its Popmoney user base.The company's mobile banking solution, more commonly known as its Mobiliti product suite, has also performed decently for the most recent fiscal year, adding more than 400 clients, with the grand total numbering almost 2,100. Mobiliti provides mobile banking and payment services to consumers and financial institutions. It allows consumers to keep track of their finances, and enables financial institutions to provide a mobile banking solution to their customers without requiring to investing in developing an in-house solution, which would entail incurring additional costs in a period where banks are focused on downsizing and efficiency.These initiatives are also aided by secular tailwinds as detailed by Gartner, according to one of its research directors.As the wider market grows, Fiserv is very likely to benefit from this growth as it already has many relevant solutions on the market. Therefore, expect the company to be able to capitalize on this secular trend going forward.Bolt-on acquisition strategy continuesThose who are familiar with Fiserv's acquisition strategy would know that the company has historically adopted the bolt-on acquisition model. This strategy has continued, with the company acquiring OpenSolutions, a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, in 2013. Naturally, the business which OpenSolutions conducts, complements Fiserv's core business model. The acquisition not only provided Fiserv with an increased client base, thereby allowing cross-selling opportunities, but also provided Fiserv with the target's primary account processing product, DNA. DNA is a real-time platform which allows financial institutions to add and customize ancillary solutions to their core products, through the platform's open architecture. It goes without saying that this acquisition allowed Fiserv to further expand its product offerings. The acquisition has continued to bear fruit for Fiserv, as the company closed 26 DNA sales for its most recent fiscal year, with 57 new clients since the acquisition.High customer switching costs, large customer base, limited customer concentration, long-term contracts will allow for customer retention and stable recurring cash flowFiserv's customers experience high switching costs due to the fact that the technology solutions that the fin-tech giant provides (primarily account and payment processing) to financial institutions are mission-critical. In other words, financial institutions would not be able to operate without Fiserv's products. Switching to a competing product is unlikely too, as a competitor is likely to have an entirely different system, which would lead to operational disturbance. Hence, Fiserv's customers are essentially locked into the company's products.The company also has a large customer base, serving over 14,500 financial institutions. In addition, the company also has limited customer concentration, where its largest 50 clients represent less than a quarter of the company's top-line. Said another way, even if we ignore the high switching costs that Fiserv's clients experience, any customer desertion stemming from the company's clients switching to a competitor is unlikely to have a large adverse impact on the company's overall revenue base.Furthermore, the contracts that the company enters into, with its clients, are long-term in nature, lasting three to five years at a time. The long duration of the contract not only allows Fiserv's clients to get familiarized with its technology solutions and hence develop a certain degree of stickiness to the company, but also provides Fiserv with stable recurring cash flow.For the reasons above, I continue to believe that the company will continue to experience high levels of customer retention, thereby leading to continued stable recurring cash flow generation going forward.Further margin expansion possibleFiserv is likely to be able to achieve further margin expansion due to its highly scalable and capital-light business model. The company's business is highly scalable in that it costs incrementally less for the company to add another customer to its existing user base. This is supported by the fact that the company's cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues have been on the gradual decline for most of its operating history (cost of processing & services revenue, which is the company's largest operating segment, fell from 52.9% in 2012 to 51.3% in 2014). The company's business is relatively capital-light in that it does not require much capital reinvestment to prosper (capital expenditures has historically been around 5-6% of sales). Given the above reasons, I believe the company is able to continue achieving significant operating leverage and scale efficiencies, which will result in meaningful margin expansion going forward.Liquidity remains intactThe company's liquidity situation remains manageable. In the near-term (one to three years), contractual obligations, primarily long-term debt repayments, amount to $1.7b. Operating cash flow in its most recent financial year amounted to $1.3b. Although the company has other obligations that are not legally enforceable (share repurchases) which may augment pressure on its cash situation, the company can easily rollover its long-term debt in order to satisfy its cash needs as they come due, given that it continues to generate a large amount of cash flow every year. Ergo, near-term liquidity is not a concern.Rate hike should be a net positiveThe Fed has recently announced that a rate hike is likely in late-2015. I believe that this will be an overall boon for Fiserv as it derives a majority (over 80%) of its revenues from account and transaction processing fees, courtesy of its financial institution clients who tend to prosper in an increasing-rate environment. Furthermore, the company interest burden is unlikely to be so great as to offset the positives from a rate hike situation. Management has revealed that a 1% increase in the company's borrowing costs would result in a mere increase of millions in interest expense. Thus, the upcoming rate hike should be a net positive for Fiserv.Introduction of NOWFiserv recently introduced its NOW network (Network for Our World) which addresses the need to make payments faster, quicker, and more efficient. The company cites that more than 55 billion payments each year do not involve payment for goods and services at the point of sale. These payments are processed on paper, which are inherently slow. The NOW network aims to change this, making payments frictionless. Like many of Fiserv's initiatives, this venture benefits both consumers and financial institutions as they increase the speed and ease of payment processing. The company recently formed a partnership with U.S. Bank based on this initiative. Overall, I find the introduction of NOW to be a great move for Fiserv, as the company can pitch its frictionless payment solution to sign new clients, and then cross-sell its other products after.Swift-Fiserv Australian collaborationFiserv has partnered with SWIFT to enhance Australia's payments infrastructure through the NPP initiative. Both parties will work together under a 12-year contract to overhaul the country's existing infrastructure, making payment processing in the country quicker and more efficient. This collaboration also allows Fiserv to expand its presence within Australia, which is a higher-growth market compared to the markets that the company currently serves (mainly U.S.).ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at growth rates of 5% to 4% throughout the 5-year projection period. This growth is supported by secular tailwinds, along with Fiserv's expanding product offerings (Mobiliti, Popmoney, NOW, etc) and historical growth rates. EBITDA margins are expected to gradually expand to 34% by the end of the projection period. This margin expansion is supported by the company's highly scalable and relatively capital-light business model, allowing the fin-tech giant to derive significant operating leverage and scale efficiencies. The company currently trades at 15x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 9% discount rate (due to the high customer switching costs, large customer base, limited customer concentration, and long-term contracts resulting in stable recurring cash flow, inter alia), the model produces a fair value of $94 for Fiserv. This indicates that there is slight upside (17%) to be realized at current trading levels. My outlook on the company is hence bullish - investors are advised to initiate a long position at current levels."
3249555,63483,2015-06-10T11:27:06-04:00,"Favorable tailwinds should allow strong performance to continue.Further margin expansion is likely to occur.Relatively new offerings (Popmoney, Mobiliti, DNA) are gaining traction and should help in augmenting customer stickiness further.Annuity-like cash flow generation will allow for continued share buybacks.I reiterate my bullish stance on Fiserv.","Earnings ReviewFiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) reported strong Q1 results. As a quick reminder, FISV is an extremely solid business, ideal for an investor with a long-term horizon. Mission-critical offerings, coupled with an extremely sticky customer base with high switching costs (most of FISV's offerings are deeply embedded in their customers' workflow), sets the company up as a strong candidate for a core holding within a diversified portfolio. Additionally, FISV is not merely sitting around - the company has been investing in new initiatives and capitalizing on recent trends (especially mobile), which I will discuss later.Q1 momentum is likely to continue going into the second quarter due to favorable macro tailwinds. Further margin expansion is likely to occur due to the scalability of FISV's business model. The company's relatively new offerings such as Popmoney, Mobiliti and DNA have received generally positive responses from its customer base, indicating that these initiatives are beginning to gain traction. Apart from adding yet more recurring revenue streams to the business, these new offerings also augment customer stickiness. The fin-tech provider's annuity-like cash flow generation persists, with FCF growing at double-digits. This fabled cash generation capacity should allow for continued share buybacks in the future.Favorable tailwinds should allow strong performance to continueFISV posted modest top-line growth, with revenue rising to $1.27b (+3.3% Y/Y), while diluted GAAP EPS jumped to $0.73 (+12.3% Y/Y), mainly due to the company's continued share repurchases. As for profitability, operating margins expanded to 24.6% (+270bps Y/Y). In terms of analyst estimates, the company edged out expectations slightly, posting diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 vs. projections of $0.86, surprising approximately 4% to the upside.I opine that this strong momentum is likely to continue going into the second quarter, aided by favorable macro tailwinds such as comforting job market and consumer metrics. US consumer borrowing remains resilient, while ADP reports job growth has been steadily increasing, and Nielsen recently announced an uptick in consumer confidence.These metrics all point toward increased payment processing activity, which is FISV's bread-and-butter. Additionally, although market interest rates have been on the rise lately, they remain at extremely depressed levels. This provides a healthy backdrop for FISV to capitalize on in the near-term. Therefore, I expect FISV's steady performance to continue going into the second quarter.Further margin expansion likely to occurDue to the highly-scalable feature of FISV's business model, I submit that further margin expansion is likely to occur. Although the company has been investing heavily into growth initiatives, which mainly consist of a transition to mobile payments/solutions, investment requirements have been relatively minimal. Furthermore, many of these new initiatives are very FISV-like in that they are highly scalable - although they require huge (in absolute terms) upfront costs, maintenance costs are effectively rounding errors to a company the size of FISV. As a result, I continue to expect further margin expansion from the fin-tech provider in the following quarters.Relatively new offerings are gaining traction nd should help in augmenting customer stickiness furtherIn a prior article, I alluded to the company's new offerings - Popmoney, Mobiliti and DNA. These offerings have been gaining traction since their launch. A top 40 bank recently selected FISV to supply solve their account processing needs. This deal included the addition of the bank into FISV's Popmoney network.With digital and mobile solutions being all the rage now, financial institutions are hurrying to keep up with one another, and FISV has been helping them do it. During the quarter, the company signed 36 new clients to its Mobiliti platform. Most notably, the company has only signed up 8% of its business banking customer base. In other words, the platform is rapidly gaining acceptance and still has a ton of room left to grow.As for DNA, which was an acquired product (FISV acquired OpenSolutions, which developed the DNA banking platform), the company prominently signed with Vibrant Credit Union, an institution with $500m in assets and 41,000 members. Management also reported four new DNA clients going live during the quarter, along with expectations that twice the number of institutions will go live this fiscal year compared to the previous year.In a nutshell, the company's new offerings are quickly gaining acceptance among existing and potential clients alike. Growth potential for these products remain monstrous as the company has only cross-sold these offerings to a fraction of its customer base. Apart from the improvement in operating results (top- and bottom-line) and additional recurring revenue streams that these new offerings are sure to bring, they also allow FISV to augment customer stickiness further. The more solutions and platforms a client uses, the greater their reliance on FISV. Considering that the fin-tech giant typically provides mission-critical products and services, its already-sustainable customer stickiness is enhanced further, thanks to the introduction of the aforementioned offerings.Annuity-like cash flow generation will allow for continued share buybacksIn my previous article on FISV, I emphasized the key features that form the basis of the company's competitive advantage. They are:Considering the above, it is obvious that a company like FISV would be able to consistently generate annuity-like cash flows over the long-term. And it has. Free cash flow (as defined by FISV), which has been steadily increasing for many years, grew to $268m (+15% Y/Y). Keeping in mind the durable competitive advantage that the company possesses, FISV is almost certainly assured to continue generating such high-quality cash flows over a long-term horizon.Obviously, an investor in FISV can thus expect substantial share buyback programs year after year. Although such practices (dubbed ""financial engineering"" by market pundits) have a negative connotation associated with them, I continue to believe that FISV is allocating capital masterfully. Reinvestments into a business like FISV is minimal due to the nature (high upfront costs, low subsequent costs) of the company's offerings. Investors should not expect the company to be able to reinvest the entirety of its earnings while still maintaining high returns on capital. Therefore, it is wise to return excess cash to investors as FISV continues to do so (FISV chooses to repurchase shares instead of declaring dividends). During the quarter, FISV bought back 3.8m shares with 16m remaining shares authorized for repurchase. When these shares are gobbled up by the company eventually, expect an announcement of an even larger share buyback program.Bullish stance reiterated, 20% upside potential from current levelsAs seen above, my assumptions regarding the company's future performance remain unchanged largely due to the fact that the company continues to perform more or less in-line with my expectations. Investors should expect this given that FISV is an extremely predictable and boring business. Given that my model continues to imply 20% upside potential ($95 price target) for FISV, I reiterate my bullish stance on the company."
3505416,86456,2015-09-12T13:25:12-04:00,"Private equity group KKR & Co. is selling shares of First Data in what will likely be the largest IPO of 2015.The IPO will give us a good opportunity to measure the level of opportunity available for PE groups to sell investments an lock in profits.If the First Data IPO is successful, it could relieve investor concerns and send shares of private equity companies higher. If not, it could be a long winter.","Private equity group KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR) recently announced that they will be selling shares of First Data Corp (FDATA) to investors in what is expected to be the biggest IPO of 2015. Shares of First Data could be listed and begin trading before the end of the month, so says a recent Bloomberg article.According to the article, KKR expects to sell $2.5 billion dollars worth of shares to the public. Given the fact that KKR paid $29.8 billion dollars to acquire First Data in 2007, it is assumed that the IPO will only represent a small portion of the total company.Private Equity investors will be reviewing the prospectus for First Data carefully to determine what portion of the company the $2.5 billion dollars of stock represents. This will help us know what type of incentive allocations KKR will likely generate through its sale of a portion of this company.(Private equity companies typically raise capital from institutional investors and invest this capital in opportunities like the buyout of First Data. When the private equity company sells such an investment for a gain, the company is typically entitled to a portion of the profits in what is known as an ""incentive allocation"" or ""performance fee"")First Data's Growing BusinessFirst Data is a payment processing company, managing 1.7 trillion dollars in payments, or 74 billion transactions (according to 2014 figures). Last year, First Data collected revenues of $11.2 billion and recorded operating profit of $1.4 billion.While First Data still recorded a net loss for 2014, the loss was primarily due to $1.74 billion in interest expense from KKR's leveraged buyout.KKR is selling a portion of its ownership of First Data to pay down part of the $22.2 billion in debt. This debt is a result of the leveraged buyout transaction from when KKR first purchased the company for $29.8 billion in 2007.To determine a valuation for this IPO (and thus how many shares to sell and what price to propose for the offering), KKR will likely look at its competitors. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) currently trades for 37.6 times earnings, and Total Systems (NYSE:TSS) currently has a 26.1 price/earnings ratio.Of course a P/E ratio isn't directly comparable to a valuation for First Data based on the company's operating profit, but we can safely assume that KKR will try to negotiate a multiple somewhere close to 25 times operating earnings for this company. That would value First data near $35 billion.If KKR is trying to raise $2.5 billion through this IPO, then we could deduct that the private equity company will likely sell somewhere around 7% of the company to public shareholders.Selling 7% of First Data at a makret valuation near $35 billion would likely result in a $360 million gain for KKR on this small portion of the company. If KKR receives 20% of that profit as an incentive allocation, the deal could represent $7.2 million in realized profit (and that's just on 7% of KKR's position)Bottom line, this transaction has the potential to add directly to KKR's bottom line for the third quarter, with much more potential for larger profits as KKR liquidates the remaining portion of its First Data position.Of course these figures are simply estimations. But walking through the potential valuation for First Data is helpful in determining what the deal could do for KKR's profits.The success or failure of the First Data IPO will be an important indicator of how much risk investors are willing to take on new offerings, and also how much opportunity private equity companies have for locking in profits by selling investments to the general public.A Concerning Environment for Private Equity InvestorsShares of private equity companies have traded lower in recent weeks, primarily due to investor concerns about lower market prices and heightened levels of risk.The concern is that if the broad stock market trades lower, private equity companies won't have as much opportunity to sell profitable investments. Without the ability to sell and lock in profits, these companies will not be able to generate the same level incentive allocations that they have enjoyed during the bull market.Below, you can see the stock price declines for KKR along with rivals The Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), The Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG), and Och-Ziff Capital Management (OZM)(Source: TradeStation)While private equity companies have three primary ways to generate profits (management fees, incentive allocations, and return on their own invested capital), the incentive allocations are typically the most lucrative profit opportunities for these firms.For example, last year The Blackstone Group received 71% of its $4.3 billion dollars in profit from incentive allocations.If KKR is successful with its $2.5 billion dollar First Data IPO transaction, the deal will go far in assuaging investor concerns.If the IPO turns out to be a flop, however, all bets are off. The deal could wind up being a bearish catalyst for private equity groups, confirming fears of lower incentive allocations and causing private equity groups to potentially cut distributions to shareholders over the next few quarters.Three Things to Watch With the First Data IPOOver the next few weeks, we will start to get more information about KKR's plans for the IPO.KKR will be conducting a ""road show,"" in which First Data executives will likely travel to meet with key institutional investors and advisors to pitch the deal. The goal of these meetings is to drum up demand for the IPO so that shares can be allocated to investors when the deal takes place.From that point, the underwriters (with Citigroup (NYSE:C), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) taking the lead) will collect indications of interest (or IOIs) from these investors. At the same time, a preliminary prospectus will be filed with the SEC stating all important information about the company along with the number of shares expected to price and the price range that the underwriters expect for the IPO.The first thing we will be watching with this deal is the pricing of the IPO. The price at which the underwriters sell stock to the public will be based on the indications of interest that they receive from potential investors.If demand for the deal is high, there is a good chance that the underwriters will raise the price range in the days leading up to the deal. More importantly, if the deal prices at the high end of the range (or even above the expected range for the IPO), it will signify that investor risk appetite is high.Incidentally, it will also leave KKR with larger profits on its First Data investment - leading to higher incentive allocations and larger distributions for KKR shareholders.The second data point (no pun intended) that we will be watching is the number of shares sold in the IPO. Before the transaction takes place, the First Data prospectus will indicate how many shares are expected to be sold to the public.If a deal is ""oversubscribed"" it means that there is plenty of demand for First Data shares and that there are actually more investors asking for shares than the number of shares being offered. In some cases, underwriters will actually expand the deal, offering more shares in the transaction to keep up with demand.On the other hand, the kiss of death is an ""undersubscribed"" deal in which the underwriters are not able to find enough investors to take all of the shares that are being offered in the deal. Obviously an oversubscribed IPO would be ideal for KKR, and would help investor sentiment for private equity groups in general.Our third point of interest will be how the stock trades immediately following the IPO. For many popular oversubscribed IPO transactions, the stock is sold to investors at one price, but then when it begins trading in the open market the stock price is sharply higher.This would be a great indication that demand for First Data is strong. Also, keep in mind that KKR is only selling a small portion of its position in First Data. So if the stock trades sharply higher from the IPO price, it will allow KKR to eventually sell more shares and collect even higher profits on its remaining ownership in First Data.Timing is Everything...KKR's decision to sell shares of First Data in today's market is a bit curious. Following the market's downturn in August, investors have less risk appetite and volatility levels are higher. This seems an odd time for KKR to begin selling its position in First Data.Skeptics could argue that KKR is hitting the panic button, trying to work its way out of this investment now, before the market trades even lower. But that doesn't really make sense, considering the fact that KKR will likely still be the majority owner well after th IPO is priced.More likely, KKR is confident that demand for First Data will be strong and that the transaction will help KKR generate some initial incentive allocations and also set a market price for its remaining shares. After all, the majority of profits will be made from follow-on offerings of First Data and not from the IPO itself.Up, down or sideways, we'll be watching the First Data IPO carefully. Not because of any particular interest in the spin off, but because of what the transaction means for private equity profits for the rest of the year."

With all the change and disruption now challenging the company's clients, Fiserv’s services have never been more valuable or needed.Fiserv has the financial strength, technology and experience to offer solution leadership to a rapidly evolving financial services landscape. The company generates more than $4 billion of mostly recurring revenue with strong and improving margins thanks to long-term contracts. Fiserv generates significant free cash flow and produces consistent double-digit EPS growth. Figure 1 depicts Fiserv’s long-term EPS growth (green line with white triangles) since 1991.Figure 1: Long-term EPS Growth:In figure 2, we overlay monthly closing stock prices (black line). Note the importance of valuation. When the price (black line) touches the earnings line (green line with white triangles), the stock is trading at fair value. When the price is above earnings, the company is overpriced. When the price is below earnings, the company is undervalued. Most importantly, note how the price moves back to value when it gets disconnected. Finally on a historical basis, figure 2 shows that FISV is currently undervalued.Figure 2: Long-term EPS Growth Correlated to Price:In figure 3, we calculate performance since Dec. 31, 1990. Long-term Fiserv shareholders enjoyed returns significantly above the S&P 500, correlating to the earnings growth Fiserv achieved.Figure 3: Long-term Price Performance History:Market LeadershipThanks to award-wining innovation, Fiserv is the U.S. market leader in account processing, ACH (automatic clearing house) processing, electronic bill payments and online banking. With numerous regulatory changes proposed by the Obama administration, Fiserv customers will be highly motivated to increase information technology spending. No competitor is better positioned than Fiserv to exploit this growing opportunity.Exponential growth in devices such as smartphones should lead to significant billed services opportunities for Fiserv. As more and more business is done online, customers big and small will rely more and more on Fiserv technology innovations. In 2007, Fiserv acquired the now fully integrated CheckFree and divested its trust business. In 2008, Fiserv divested its health business as it positioned and prepared for the burgeoning opportunity in financial services.Focused on FinancialToday, Fiserv services are utilized in more than 16,000 institutions with more than 114,000 branches and 700 million accounts. Thus far, Fiserv has exceeded targeted penetration rates and foresees a significant opportunity ahead. Now focused on financials, Fiserv operates in two important business segments:Payments: representing just under half its revenue - includes electronic banking, card services, risk management, investment services and output solutionsFinancial: composed of account processing, item processing, source capture, lending solutions and home equity processingPrudent Capital AllocationHistorically, Fiserv has a proven record of smart capital allocation policies. Since 2005, while its stock has been mostly undervalued, the company reduced shares outstanding by more than 25%. In 2007, Fiserv purchased CheckFree, which increased its long-term debt above typical levels. Since 2007, the company has allocated its prodigious free cash flow to mandatory debt repayment. Capital allocation priorities are R&D to drive growth, maintain differentiation and pay down debt. However, Fiserv is prepared to examine strategic acquisitions and continued share repurchases. Management is confident in maintaining capital strength and flexibility as it anticipates more than $2 billion of free cash flow during the next three years.Strong Foundation for GrowthWe believe that Fiserv possesses a strong foundation for growth. Its recent business transformation should deliver high quality earnings and cash flow growth. Financial strength and flexibility should enable it to build shareholder value.Figure 4 calculates the forecast 5-year growth rate of 15.3%, as presented by 15 analysts reporting to Zacks. Trading at around 12 times earnings represents attractive valuation in our view.Figure 4: EPS 5-year Forecast:ConclusionWe believe that Fiserv represents an attractive, high-quality opportunity for the prudent long-term investor seeking capital appreciation. To us, long term means at least one business cycle - 3-5 years. The idea is to buy $1 of earnings today that could grow into $2 of earnings in 3 to 5 years. Therefore, even if the market capitalized the company at a P/E ratio of only half of what you originally paid, you would still break even. The double in 3 to 5 years implies a growth rate of 15%-20%.We never try to forecast short-term price movement, since we believe that to be impossible other than by luck. Instead, we feel that forecasting business growth (i.e., earnings growth) is both easier and more reliable to accomplish. Get earnings right, and the stock price will take care of itself in time - assuming, of course, that you pay a reasonable price at time of purchase.Disclosure: Long FISV at time of writing.The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

2506805,24264,2014-09-19T07:00:42-04:00,"Fiserv introduced a new mobile payment system last week that will rival Apple Pay.The company is relying on innovation and traditional bill payments to drive revenues in the future.Increased investment has led to falling margins and a large price rise in the company's share price, leaving valuation multiples looking a little stretched.","Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), provider of financial services technology worldwide, hopes to ride the coattails of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) newly released mobile payment option to increase revenues. Apple released Apple Pay last week, making it available through the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch. Apple Pay is a service that essentially lets users pay through their phones --or watches-- rather than swiping a credit card.A day after Apple's announcement, Fiserv capitalized on the Apple Pay hype through a press release, also announcing it had a new mobile payments partnership of its own, with Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Fiserv hopes to provide ""tokenization"" capabilities. This means rather than swiping a credit card - which can be replicated or stolen - a unique ""token"" number is generated for each transaction. Fiserv will act as a go-between, translating those ""tokens"" to the original number and securely processing the payment.As the smartphone market has drastically grown the past few years, so has the demand for on-the-go payment options. Although tokenization isn't a new technology, it is a scalable service like Apple Pay, which creates a system that can legitimize and spread to many new users very quickly.The chart below shows both Fiserv's revenue and price since 2010. Adjusted revenue in the payment segment increased 5% to $591 million in the most recent quarter, and for the first six months of the year increased 7% to $1.2 billion. The growth was largely due to strength in the company's card services and bill payment segments, according to management.Fiserv signed 88 new bill payment clients in the quarter and 170 through the first six months, as well as seeing bill payments transaction volume grow 3% in the quarter and 5% in the first six months. The increase in transactions is partially due to improving consumer macro trends, as well as the company's expansion of member institutions in the Popmoney network during the quarter. Fiserv now has over 2,200 institutions contracted to offer these credit services.Fiserv is hoping traditional avenues of growth, such as facilitating bill payments and credit services, will be able to coincide with new technology such as mobile ""tokenization,"" to push both share price and revenues higher in the future.Although future growth looks optimistic, operating margins have been falling since 2011 as Fiserv has remained committed to investing in new projects. The company discussed falling margins in its most recent conference call. ""Margin performance was driven by operating leverage in our scale businesses, offset by continued investment in areas such as Mobiliti,"" said Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hirsch.Mobiliti ASP is a tablet banking solution, which enables financial institutions to provide a differentiated experience to the more than 60 million tablet banking users in the U.S today. Since its inception last year, 16% of the company's Mobiliti ASP clients have begun to offer the solution.Similarly, Mobiliti business goes live this year. This ASP solution allows financial institution clients to provide their business customer with the compelling suite of mobile capabilities such as remote deposit capture, entitlements, payment initiation and approval. Fiserv says interest is very strong across nearly 1200 institutions using its business online services today.Although revenue growth hasn't manifested just yet, Fiserv expects to see tangible results from this user based subscription offering over the next several years. There is hope that the investment will pay off, but for now, Mobiliti continues to weigh on margins.Another concern is the drastic rise of the company's forward price to sales multiple following increased growth projections and a strong share price rise over the past five years. The forward price to sales multiple is currently at 3.248, almost double what it was in 2012. This signals that although there is a lot of growth priced into the company's future earnings, the share price may be a little stretched at the moment.Fiserv's innovation and continued success in bill payments should be a catalyst for higher earnings, but it does not come without some risks. Operating margins have been declining as the company heavily invests in such innovation, and expected revenues have driven valuation multiples up to five year highs. Fiserv is an attractive long term play, but one must be willing to pay up for it at a slightly stretched valuation."

213144,23791,2010-07-05T08:33:31-04:00,,"Background  Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) is the leading provider of products and services required by financial institutions to run their banking operations. Fiserv has over 16,000 clients and in 2009, generated $4 billion in revenues, $850 million in cash flow from operations, $668 million in free cash flow. Since the management change in 2005, Fiserv has been in a state of flux. Management has focused on strengthening the core financial services business via strategic acquisitions, improving operational efficiency and divesting non-core assets such as the insurance and health segments. Today, the company is organized under two segments - 1. Financial Services - This segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with core banking services such as account processing, item processing, loan origination / servicing products and other services that support many different financial transactions. These services are billed on a per account (general deposit account servicing and maintainance) or per transaction basis (check clearing,  check imaging, etc). Many financial institutions choose to outsource their data processing operations in order to cut the costs needed to maintain in-house IT operations. Fiserv has a dominant  market share of 37% in this business segment. This segment generates 47% of revenue and 48% of operating income.  2. Payment - This segment provides electronic banking, electronic bill payment and settlement, credit/debit processing products and other related services to support the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry. In late 2007, Fiserv acquired Checkfree Corporation. This acquisition transformed it into a leader in electronic commerce services and products including electronic bill payment and internet banking. This segment contributes 53% of the company revenues and 52% of the operating income. This segment should also provide much of the future growth for Fiserv. Approximately 80% of Fiserv's revenues are generated from account and transaction based fees typically under contracts that are 3-5 years in length. Since Fiserv supports core banking functions that support day-to-day operations, its business is fairly robust and not very economically sensitive. In addition, high switching costs and risks such as potential outages due to system changes result in very low client attrition rate of < 3% and hence stable, predictable cash flows.  Is this a growth story? A common risk associated with Fiserv is the risk of consolidation within the financial industry. In the past 25 years, consolidation has resulted in -3% CAGR in the number of financial depository institutions. On the other hand, assets in the financial industry have grown by more than 5 fold over the same period. Also, in the last five years, deposit accounts in the US have grown at the annual rate of 7% and now total 718 million. Since Fiserv derives its revenues primarily from fees collected for deposit account servicing and transaction processing, the number of deposit accounts have a stronger influence on Fiserv's fortunes as compared to the number of depository institutions.    Fiserv is the leader in electronic bill pay processing and provides the largest network of places to pay them, both via the financial institution websites as well as billers' own website. An avenue of growth is the increase in adoption of electronic banking and electronic bill payment transactions. Electronic bill payments represent significant transactions volumes for financial institutions. This should further increase as mobile / handheld devices add to computers as a means to get online. Over time, the number of billable services that support our daily lives also continues to increase. Current electronic bill pay customer adoption among Fiserv's client base averages 10%. The company believes that this average adoption rate can be increased four to five fold. In today's tough economy, the company forecasts 1-3% growth in revenue for 2010 with 5-8% growth in free cash flow. Longer term, Fiserv expects to grow its revenues in the range of 6-9% with 10-14% growth in free cash flow.  Management The management continues to take steps to strengthen the recurring revenue or transaction based business model by strategic acquisitions (example - Checkfree) and new innovation (example - ZashPay - p2p e-pay). The goal is to make Fiserv a global leader in transaction based technology solutions. In addition, the following points are noteworthy - 1. Management continues to eye debt reduction as a use of free cash flow though long term debt is a very manageble 2.8 times EBITDA. This debt was acquired during the $4.4 billion acquisition of Checkfree in 2007.  2. In the last 5 years, the shares outstanding have been reduced by 20%. In May 2009, a 5 million shares buyback was authorized (2.2 million shares authorization remaining by Dec 2009) . In Feb 2010, additional 5 million shares buyback was authorized. With solid free cash flow and low capex requirements, these buybacks should continue. 3. Management continues to own shares and align themselves with shareholders. The chairman owns ~ 2.2 million shares. Total outstanding shares are ~ 152 million. 4. Since the new management took over in 2005, improving operational effectiveness has been a focus. In the past five years, operating margin has improved by about 5.8% to end at ~ 23%. Management has stated that further gains in operating margins should be achieved. More news on this front is expected at the investors meeting this Fall.Valuation Fiserv competes in a market dominated by few players such as Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS), and Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY). Few market players and high switching costs result in stable pricing and hence, predictable cash flows. In 2009, $668 million of free cash flow was generated. 2010 free cash flow is expected to be $720 million. With a market capitalization of $6.9 billion, the company trades at 9.5 times 2010 free cash flow. Also, note that stock buybacks and debt reductions will further highlight the company's under-valuation.  Disclosure: Long FISV"

Fiserv meets that description. Earnings per share rose each year from 1993 right through 2008 and 2009’s first half saw EPS up 9.3% year over year.Zacks and Value Line project EPS of about $3.65 for 2009 and $4.10-$4.15 for 2010. Value Line puts FISV’s ‘earnings predictability’ and ‘stock price stability’ rankings at the 100th and 90th percentiles (with 100th being best). They also rank Fiserv as ‘above average’ for safety. Morningstar assigns a 4-Star rating (out of 5) and figures ‘Fair Value’ at $61 /share.What makes Fiserv’s business so attractive is the ‘sticky’ nature of their services. Because it is so disruptive to change providers Fiserv has posted around a 99% retention rate with its multi-year contracts. They have about 37% nationwide market share overall.Fiserv got ahead of the curve in the trend towards online bill paying with their December 2007 acquisition of CheckFree. This is a fast growing business and CheckFree is the market leader.Here are Fiserv’s per share numbers as reported by Value Line:Despite the stellar results documented above, Fiserv shares are now offered at less than 13x this year’s and 11.6x next year’s estimates. That’s the lowest valuation on these shares ever (excepting last fall’s panic low).The 10-year median multiple was 25x and the past 5-year average P/E was 17.8x even including last year’s historic sell-off. A return to even 17 times this year’s $3.65 projection would bring FISV back to $62 or about 31% above today’s quote.Is that a rational target price? As noted earlier, Morningstar sees fair value as $61. Value Line is using a 19 multiple for their own 3-5 year ‘normalized P/E. History also confirms the possibility. Fiserv actually traded as high $59.80 in 2007 and $56.80 in 2008 when EPS came in at $2.66 and $3.27 – well below what they are presently.Here’s a nice medium-term play that can capture most of that expected move even if FISV doesn’t reach my goal price right away.If high-quality Fiserv rises by at least $2.75 or 5.9% to $50, by theMarch 19, 2010 expiration date:That’s a best-case scenario profit of $11,450 / $38,550 = 29.7% achieved in about 7.1 months on shares that only needed to rise by a minimal 5.9% from trade inception.What’s the risk?If Fiserv stays below $50 through March 19, 2010:What’s the break-even on the whole trade? On the original 1000 shares it’s their $47.25 /share purchase price less the $3.10 /share call premium = $44.15 /share.On the ‘put’ shares it’s the $50 strike price less the $5.60 /share put premium = $44.40 /share.Your overall break-even would be $44.28 /share.Fiserv could drop by as much as $2.97 /share or (-6.3%) without causing a loss on this trade.Summary: Fiserv is a good quality, growth stock at an attractive valuation.A target price of $60+ seems justifiable based on full year 2009 estimates.The trade detailed above can produce a 7.1 month total return of almost 30% on any rise in FISV shares to $50 or above.You are protected against loss as long as Fiserv remains above $44.28 through the March 19, 2010 expiration date.Disclosure: Author is long FISV shares and short FISV options."
3027876,66213,2015-03-25T12:41:27-04:00,First Data reported its first profitable quarter since 2007.The payment processing industry is evolving with First Data leading the way.I've outlined an early look into what will most likely be the biggest IPO of 2015.,"Handling 45% of US credit and debit transactions and with a reach of 6 million merchants globally, First Data (FDATA) is the largest player in the payments industry. In 2007, just prior to the financial crisis, First Data was taken private by the private equity firm KKR (NYSE:KKR) in an extremely leveraged buyout consisting of $24 billion in debt financing. The privatization of First Data would soon be recognized as one of KKR's biggest debacles. However, under the leadership of their new CEO, Frank Bisignano, First Data shows signs of new light and strong future growth.Combine their dominance as a leader in payment technology with their massive network consisting of millions of merchant renewals, and First Data is going to be at the forefront of the evolving payment processing industry. Being one of the new innovators involved with some of the technology behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay makes this opportunity massive for First Data as they will be a leader in helping to roll out the new payment processing to merchants globally.Although it's not ""official,"" it is inevitable, close, and the top discussion amongst bankers on Wall Street, who are fighting for the projected $40 million in fees from the IPO. KKR has been injecting cash into the company to improve its balance sheet to suit up for what is likely to be the biggest IPO of 2015.Recent financial developmentsBelow are a few recent developments that investors should know:· In July 2014, First Data completed a private placement of $3.5 billion of its common equity. The capital was used to pay down debt, strengthening the balance sheet.· In the same month, they repriced $5.7 billion of 2018 term loans, which will yield a savings of over $25 million in annual interest.· Combining the investment and refinancing will result in an annual interest savings of about $440 million.· First Data reported net income of $12 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, the first quarter of profit since 2007.Where's the revenue growth?The big problem investors will face when deciding to invest is the slow revenue growth of the company. The sluggish 3% growth year-over-year might actually seem reasonable for the largest payment processing company. However, when considering the $21 billion of debt still on the books, it's not enough for an investor to get excited about. So the only way for First Data to pay down their debt and stimulate the investment community is by driving revenue to all time highs.And if the lack of revenue growth doesn't scare off investors, then the failure to turn a profit might. However, keep in mind that First Data showed a $12 million profit last quarter, their first profit of the last 29 quarters.(N. Durante, 2015)All numbers were derived from First Data's financials, which can be found in their investor relations section here.Technology to drive revenueApple PayIn September 2014, First Data announced it would bring Apple Pay to its network. First Data will be providing the security technology which allows consumers to pay via mobile phone. A key piece to their security package, TransArmor, is tokenization, which secures cardholders' information by adding another layer of security, therefore reducing risk of a breach. With First Data being the leader in payment technology, and having such a huge global reach, this opportunity can be a large piece of First Data's growth.It is still too early to tell how much of an impact Apple Pay will have since so few vendors support it. However, we have seen mobile payments surge where they are accepted, such as at Whole Foods Market (WFM) and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA).CloverIn December 2012, First Data acquired Clover, a cloud based POS platform. Their hardware system, Clover Station, began shipping in 2014, selling 17,000 units in the first six months, beating its competitor Square Stand. Clover has announced it will implement Apple Pay functionality into its POS platform as well as their next hardware product, Clover Mobile. Clover is another example of how First Data plans to push themselves to the forefront of newer innovative payment processing technology.(FirstData.com)Threats· Economy - When the economy turns sour, so does payment processing. A downturn in the economy will reduce payments processed and have a big impact on First Data. We saw how the financial crisis impacted the company in 2008 and made it incredibly difficult to cut down any of its debt due to the incredibly high interest rates they were paying.· Competition - Although First Data is the dominant player, technology is having a profound impact on payment processing, which leaves more room for small companies to grow faster and eat up market share.· Failure of Apple Pay - Apple Pay is functioning on a very small level. If there are any issues in the roll out process to more vendors it will impair future revenue and the investments First Data has already made into the platform.Will this be an undervalued IPO?Unlike the many massive IPOs of 2014, First Data will likely go under the radar. Many investors are not intrigued by the ""behind the scenes"" technology that First Data offers to the changes within its industry. Let's not forget that a lot of people do not even know what First Data is and those who do might be left with a little sour taste from their string of unsuccessful acquisitions followed by their troubling LBO just prior to the financial crisis.Yes, 2015 won't be the same as 2014 was. FIrst Data's IPO won't have the glitz and glam like Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) $25 billion sale, but that's good for the investor. I believe this IPO might fly under the radar, placing it at a price that's more than fair.So what's the fair valuation?The industry price-to-sales average ratio for a business services company is around 2.2. If we look at Vantiv (VNTV), a payment processing company that went public only a few years ago, they are trading at a market cap of around $7 billion, with current annual sales of $2.6 billion, therefore trading at about a 30% higher P/S than the industry average. The major differentiating factor between Vantiv and First Data of course is that Vantiv is smaller and has shown profitability. And although profitable, Vantiv is still trading at a price-to-earnings ratio twice as high as the business services industry, which could indicate that investors are actually interested and optimistic about the future of payment processing.The chart below shows the price-to-sales ratios of four different payment transaction companies; Vantiv, Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS), Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) and Wex (NYSE:WEX).(ycharts)As you can see from the charts, the current average P/S ratio of the four companies is 3.36, significantly higher than the business services industry average, a good sign for First Data. Coming out of the gate First Data is going to be the biggest of the bunch considering their revenue is equal to all fours companies combined. Between their size, debt load and inability to remain profitable, we can suspect that First Data will trade below the P/S average of 3.36 over the next five years. My projection is that First Data could come to the market trading as low as 2.4x revenue.(N. Durante, 2015)As you can see from the chart, First Data's EBITDA growth has been the slowest of the bunch. But considering their massive size, they have still increased their EBITDA by over 30% in the last five years, with a 9% increase from 2013 to 2014. As we can see from the other four companies, they are trading at about 11.5 times their current EBITDA. Using that multiple for First Data would put them just over $30 billion. Considering their new products and growth strategies it's very plausible to see another increase of 9% in 2015 and then 13% year after, bringing EBITDA to $3.28 billion for 2016. Applying that same multiple would bring it to a $38 billion valuation. Deduct an approximate $20 billion of debt and you're left with an $18 billion equity value.First Data has $34.269 billion in total assets and $31.551 billion in total liabilities, leaving their book value at only $2.718 billion (up 54% from 2013). Using the 11.5x EBITDA $30 billion valuation would mean that First Data would trade at about 11x its price-to-book ratio. A healthier ratio would be around 5.8, which is the business services average. However considering the sizable amount of debt on First Data's books, it is a fair ratio given the company's large sales and future outlook. The $30 billion value would also imply a P/S ratio of 2.7, significantly lower than their competitors. If investors overlook this stock and you have the opportunity to get in below a $27 billion valuation, then I would jump in. The future growth prospects are just too promising to not want to get in on the action at that price. First Data has been spending time and money figuring out how to cut down their debt and strengthen their balance sheet. I think they're on the right track, and I believe the market will value them around the $29 billion mark.ConclusionFirst Data's revenue might only see minute increases over the next few quarters. However, once Apple Pay is rolled out among more merchants and newer POS hardware systems arrive from the Clover platform, First Data may see a surge in sales like it has never before. First Data has their future riding on their technology developments and it is what places them at the forefront of the evolving payment processing industry. If we see successful sales in their new hardware technology systems and successful rollout of Apple Pay amongst more merchants, with First Data leading the way, I would not be surprised if the market values them at around $35-40 billion by the start of 2017. Keep your eyes open for this IPO."

72086,20127,2008-04-14T05:14:38-04:00,,"This post was written by my colleague and friend, John Moran.
In our last post, we discussed the notion of recurring revenues as it pertains to companies in the industrial sector. The genesis of this idea was a reaction to the prevailing wisdom of many investment strategists to find recurring revenue streams in consumer staple or health care stocks. It is my contention that there are recurring revenue themes across many sectors that remain unrecognized in the marketplace.
As a brief aside, I will mention that our posture on MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE:MSM) has received some nice support from Mr. Market since our post. Today's earnings release and conference call continue to support our thesis.
Though financial services revenues from a 30,000 foot perspective seem to be one of the last sectors one would consider to have recurring revenues, particularly in light of recent experience, there are some companies whose competitive advantages provide some assurance that business remains relatively stable despite the vagaries of the economy. Switching costs are a major advantage for many companies in this sector. Even small community banks can have a reasonably sacrosanct deposit base and provided that their lending operations remain conservative and sound, they can fit a recurring revenue theme. We think some insurance companies also fit this theme especially when their business is specialized or niche in nature.
Here are John's thoughts regarding Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which in our opinion, is a strong moat company in financial services.
Introduction
Fiserv trades at 12.5x 2009 cash earnings and 8x EV/2009 EBITDA. This is a small price to pay for a business that should grow earnings in excess of 15% per year with several sustainable competitive advantages leading to a highly recurring revenue stream. Down nearly 15% since credit issues began to take a toll on its core customers in the financial industry, market price reflects a discount of 30% to the value of the business.
Business Description
Fiserv Inc. (FISV) is a leading provider of IT services to U.S. banks, thrifts, and credit unions. The company also provides administrative support services and processing to the insurance industry. The business was repositioned late last year through the sale of selected non-banking businesses and the $4.4 billion acquisition of CheckFree, the market leader in electronic billing and payment [EBP] market. Just over 80% of Fiserv’s 2008 sales will come from its main business of core processing and related products for financial institutions and CheckFree. The balance will be derived from the company’s insurance service segment, which provides policy, rating, and claims administration as well as billing and reinsurance services.
Core Processing
Core processing is the nuts-and-bolts infrastructure that allows checks to be posted, payments to be tracked and processed, and accounts to be managed. The company’s products and services form the backbone of its client’s back-office systems and are critical to conducting business – they are not discretionary in nature. Moreover, changing core processing systems is costly and time consuming in implementation and employee training for customers. 
System changes also increase the risk of potential interruptions and service issues. Clients are therefore unlikely to leave due to a modestly cheaper or slightly superior product – once a contract has been added, the client relationship tends to be fairly sticky and pricing is reasonably inelastic. Longer-term contracts with early termination fees are the norm and renewal rates consistently run 90+%, leading to a revenue stream that is highly recurring and reasonably predictable.
The high switching costs for core processing, arguably the company’s best sustainable competitive advantage, is a double edged sword since the company’s competitors also benefit from installed bases. As such, Fiserv’s biggest challenge in this segment is generating organic sales growth. The company controls 34% of the core processing market, more than 2.5x its nearest competitor. Cost advantages from this scale position combined with a diverse and tightly integrated product set positions Fiserv better than many of its competitors to win new business. This is evidenced from the company’s 40% win rate on new core processing deals – exactly 2.5x greater than its nearest competitor according to the 2007 Automation in Banking report. Organic revenue growth has averaged just over 5% over the last five years and the business has generated operating margins near or above 20% on a consistent basis.
Consolidation among core processing companies has led to a concentration of larger players and several smaller competitors that are increasingly disadvantaged due to limited product sets and scale. The market is dominated by six major competitors with a combined 75% share down from 24 major companies in 1987 and 55% of the market is now controlled by the top three companies. While there are few compelling or willing acquisition candidates remaining, there are still some 15 independent processing companies with a little less than 25% market share – some are owned by their customers and some are small segments of larger companies. 
As industry dynamics continue to shift toward an oligopolistic structure, it seems highly likely that smaller competitors will either exit the business or lose clients to larger competitors due to service, product capabilities/breadth, pricing, or some combination thereof. Moreover, consolidating competition has intensified barriers to entry and should lead to higher marginal returns on incremental business for the companies that remain.
Electronic Billing and Payment [EBP]
Fiserv repositioned its business late last year and early this year by selling certain non-banking businesses, and acquiring CheckFree for $4.4 billion. The strategic rationale for moving away from businesses where the company lacks scale in nonbanking businesses (Fiserv Health, Investment Support, and two mortgage/lending services related businesses) and moving more aggressively into higher growth businesses where it does is compelling. The acquisition also reinforces Fiserv’s position as the leading provider of technology solutions for financial institutions and proceeds from the sales of other segments will be used to pay down debt.
CheckFree is the market leading electronic bill payment and Internet banking service provider and one of only three scale providers in a growing industry. The company was an early mover in the EBP market and has a 27% market share – more than 3.5x the share of its nearest competitor. Like the company’s competitive advantages in processing, CheckFree benefits from high switching costs and has a marked cost advantage due to scale economies of the EBP business. Also like FISV’s core processing business, more than 90% of revenues are recurring in nature.
Historically, Fiserv’s clients tended to be small and mid sized institutions that had limited internal technology groups and contracted for a fairly wide range of its services. While it maintained client relationships with larger institutions, the top 25 banks tended to buy only a handful of Fiserv’s services. With CheckFree, the company has increased exposure to larger bank clients and, as the CheckFree products are fully integrated with its existing offerings, FISV might have the opportunity to sell a broader range of existing services to larger institutions.
These upstream sales opportunities are likely somewhat limited – besides which, incremental sales to top 25 banks would likely come with pricing concessions and increased customer concentration risk (pro forma for CheckFree, we estimate that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the largest customer at somewhat under 5.5% of combined revenues). However, the company appears to have a tremendous opportunity to increase penetration of CheckFree’s bill payment and internet banking solutions within Fiserv’s core client base, where 52% of customers have yet to install an EBP solution and 25% use a competitive product.
Also, CheckFree has a reasonably long runway in the bill payment and internet banking space. Consider the following:
Insurance
The company’s insurance segment focuses on transaction processing and administrations services for the life, property and casualty, and workers’ compensation segments of the insurance industry. It is the largest third party administrator of flood insurance policies and claims in the U.S. and a leader in workers’ comp processing. Outside the flood insurance platform, the company’s competitive advantage in these businesses is somewhat limited as compared to the core processing and CheckFree businesses and competition is more intense. 
Organic revenue growth in the insurance segments had averaged well more than 5% with operating margins low teen operating margins until the last few years, when internal growth was 0% to slightly negative and operating margins for the business collapsed to a bit under 8%. The segment has faced headwinds as higher margin flood claims processing revenue decreased and lower margin workers’ compensation businesses increased. The 2007/2006 decline in flood claims processing revenues created comparability issues that should not be a factor this year.
Financials
Full-year 2008 internal revenue growth is expected to be 5% to 7%, with the financial segment at the upper end of the range and the insurance segment at the lower end of the range. This is possibly conservative given that 25% of the financial segment will now be comprised of revenue from the faster growing CheckFree business. Moreover, downstream revenue synergies that could begin materializing in the back half of this year could increase the revenue growth rate.
Fiserv has completed nearly 150 transactions since its inception in the mid-1980s, with acquired companies historically operating their businesses more or less independently. CEO Jeff Yabuki, now entering his third year at the company, has focused more on centralization, cross selling, and operational efficiency. Last year that focus yielded $50 million in incremental operating income or about 130 bps of operating margin ($30 million from integrated sales and $20 million in operational efficiencies). 
The company has more opportunities in this area and potential cost saves from the CheckFree acquisition should accelerate operating margin improvement – management guides to savings of $100 million, about 24% of CheckFree’s existing cost structure, which strikes us as achievable by the middle of 2009. Moreover, the company will not be up against difficult comparisons in the insurance segment this year. All things considered, the 75-basis points in operating margin improvement that management is currently guiding to for this year appears reasonably easy to achieve and the company should be generating operating margins of about 20% by 2009.
Over the next two years, the company will generate in excess of $1.1b in free cash flow, with the majority being used to pay down debt. By the end of 2008, EBITDA should be at a run rate of $1.5+ billion and the earnings run rate should be in excess of $4/share. Returns on invested capital will be depressed for the next few years due to the increased debt taken on in conjunction with the CheckFree acquisition, but should ultimately revert back to historic low/mid teen levels, well in excess of the company’s cost of capital. 
Financial technology and outsourced processing businesses with sustainable competitive advantages have traded for between 9.5x-12x EBITDA (on an enterprise value basis) and between 15x-20x earnings – seemingly reasonable for FISV given the competitive landscape. On either basis, the current market price looks like it provides a comfortable discount to underlying value of a high quality business.

Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) helps small, medium and large financial intuitions operate more profitably and provide superior customer service -- even better than they can do it in-house. The stress and scrutiny that the Financial Services Industry faces today represents an excellent growth opportunity for Fiserv.Fiserv is the world’s largest service and technology processing provider to banks, credit unions and lending institutions. We especially like the company’s long-term prospects because it holds an attractive niche, by providing a wide scope of services geared toward large, small and medium sized banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurance companies. Fiserv’s revenue is broadly diversified across their client base. Bank of America is their largest client, generating approximately 5% of total revenue and their next 49 clients generate 17%. The remaining 78% is spread over all other clients.Fiserv’s strong financial position allows it to continue to gain market share through a well executed plan of acquisitions that allows the company to provide an ever-increasing menu of services. Fiserv has progressed from processing core bank needs such as account maintenance to becoming a processor of payments as its customers have pursued this sector.One of Fiserv’s most notable acquisitions was Check Free acquired in December of 2007. This purchase of the world leader in online bill payment leveraged Fiserv’s already strong technology platform that sets them apart from their competition.Financial StrengthFiserv generates $4 billion dollars in revenue with 80%-85% of those revenues recurring. They are also an extraordinary generator of free cash flow. In 2008 alone, in the throes of the recession they generated over $600 million dollars of free cash flow. They skillfully invest this significant free cash flow through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.Fiserv has a very resilient business model with attractive revenue drivers, high customer retention rates of almost 99% and high recurring revenues. Fiserv gets paid based on the number of accounts and transaction fees and processing fees. Fiserv’s account processing business is one of their many moats. There are significant barriers to switching since this involves the very central nervous system of their clients’ business and it’s therefore difficult for them to switch.Since 2006, Fiserv’s consistent recurring revenue has produced strong earnings growth and they have increased their operating margin by over 450 basis points. We feel this is extraordinary financial performance given the recession and the financial industry crisis. Fiserv in recent years has generated more free cash per share than earnings per share, a further testament to the quality of their financial performance.Fiserv serves more than 16,000 clients roughly split between banks and thrifts and the other half to credit unions. Even though there has been both an industry consolidation and regulatory closures reducing the total number of institutions, Fiserv has seen U.S. account growth of 6% since 2003. Since account processing is how they get paid, the shrinking institution base has not hurt their top or bottom line.Fiserv’s two primary businesses each represent about $2 billion of revenue. First are financial services where 65% of their customers’ recurring revenue is generated. Fiserv provides banks, thrifts and credit unions account processing services on 3-5 year stable contractual relationships. Check processing and loan processing make up the remainder of their financial services business. Second, in their payments and industry products segments they are the market-leader in online banking, electronic bill payment and debit card processing. Thanks to their Check Free acquisition in 2007 they serve 21 of the top 25 institutions in bill payment processing, and are making strong advances with smaller and mid-term institutions as well. They are also a top five debit card processing provider. Additional products in this segment are risk management, output solutions and investment services.Exceptional Operating HistoryIt’s said that a picture is worth a thousand words; therefore seeing Fiserv through the perspective of our Great Companies, Inc. Fundamental Research Tool speaks volumes. As Figure 1 depicts, Fiserv has produced a remarkably consistent string of earnings growth at a compounded rate of 18.6% (green line with white triangles) earnings have risen from $.14/share in 1990 to an estimate of $3.64 in 2009.FIGURE 1: FISERV 20 Year Earning-Price Correlation (see short video)In Figure 2 we plot free cash flow (orange area with F) which incredibly has been higher than earnings per share. In addition to the obvious quality of earnings generation, we are confident that Fiserv can easily handle the 60% debt on their balance sheet.FIGURE 2: FISERV 20 Year Free Cash Flow (see short video)Looking back to Figure 1, Fiserv’s stock performance has closely correlated to its earnings growth. Even though both earnings and free cash flow (Figure 2) were exceptional in 2008 the bear market still took their stock price down to its lowest valuation in the past two decades. Clearly overdone Fiserv’s stock price is quickly moving back to value thus far in 2009. However, it still remains at a significant discount to its True Worth™. Figure 3 below shows that even at its discounted valuation Fiserv shareholders were richly rewarded far in excess of the S&P 500.FIGURE 3: FISERV 20 Year Performance(see short video)The New FiservThe financial services industry is experiencing rapid change and turmoil that we believe provides extraordinary opportunity and new avenues of growth for Fiserv. They have prepared to exploit these opportunities in many ways. Recent divestures of less synergistic businesses such as the sale of their Investment Support Services Business, Insurance Business and their Health-related Business, focuses their resources towards serving and supporting their core customers and strengths.In February of 2009 Fiserv marked their 25th anniversary by launching an enhanced market approach and a new brand identity. Their new logo  (FISERV-period) accentuates their commitment to providing superior one-stop shopping geared to helping their clients grow and increase profitability. We believe that Fiserv possesses the scale, resources and technological expertise to help their customers successfully navigate the enormous transformation occurring within the financial services industry.The “new” Fiserv is committed to innovative solutions to their clients’ changing business requirements. Six of their most noteworthy innovations illustrate this commitment: 1. Businesses Analytics for Premier – Offering customers better business intelligence. 2. Bank Intelligent Solutions - Diagnostic solutions to help customers focus where focus is needed most. 3. Carillion Online - Where users can conduct 90% of all daily financial management tasks from a single page. 4. Mobile Money – The first attempt to deliver text banking, micro-browser banking and downloadable applications to all mobile devices (I-Phone, Smart Phone, etc.) and channels. 5. MyMoney – An innovative banking application built on the Facebook® platform. 6. Source Capture Solutions – Enabling financial institutions to electronically check deposits from all points; branch, teller, ATM and more.Attractive OutlookWe believe Fiserv sits atop the cutting-edge of service and technology offerings to the troubled financial services industry. Today’s turmoil and rapidly changing landscape creates many challenges for Fiserv's clients and potentially pressures their capital requirements. Fiserv helps their clients free up capital and provides elegant and cost-effective solutions and services to help their clients grow and prosper during these challenging times. But best of all, Fiserv can be purchased at its most attractive valuation in two decades (See Figure 1).Full Disclosure: Long FISV at time of writing."
87866,20073,2008-07-30T02:06:50-04:00,,"Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) just came out with a solid earnings report (Call Transcript). For Q2, the company earned 83 cents a share from continuing ops. That beat the Street's consensus by four cents a share. Revenue rose 38% to $1.30 billion. The company projects full-year EPS at $3.28 to $3.40.Here's a look at Fiserv's stock (blue line, left scale) and earnings-per-share (gold line, right scale).The red indicates the company's EPS projection. I've scaled the graph at a ratio of 16-to-1, which is pretty conservative. That means that when the lines cross, the P/E ratio is 16.You can see how far the company's valuation has fallen even though earnings growth seems to be holding up well. That's as good a definition as any for a good buying opportunity.Disclosure: None"
1173251,24169,2013-02-11T17:38:57-05:00,,"The financial industry is recovering. Balance sheets of banks and insurers are improving and this is slowly getting reflected in their stock price. I see this as a multi-year trend. Financial companies like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and AIG (NYSE:AIG) are still trading below book value. There is a long way to go before they come even close to valuations seen in the past (1.5 to 3 times book value). My portfolio has a significant exposure (around 60% of my portfolio) to Bank of America , Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and AIG. Recently I have been looking at companies that would allow me to make a financial sector investment without directly adding to my holdings in the major banks or insurers.One of the companies that attracted my interest is Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV), a leading global provider of financial services technology serving approximately 16,000 clients worldwide. The company provides account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. More than one in three U.S. financial institutions relies on Fiserv for account processing solutions. It has the leading share in the top 100 U.S. financial institutions for online banking, bill payment and P2P payments. Its services moves more than $1 trillion in payments and handles more than 20 billion digital transactions annually. FISV generates around $4.5 billion in revenue with a net profit of $575 million.Graph 1: 10-year diluted EPS trendThe EPS share trend shows that this is a very predictable company. Even the 2008/2009 financial crisis didn't impact EPS significantly. Earnings per share have a CAGR of 10% in the last 10 years while going through one of the worst financial crisis in the last decades. Predictability is one of the critical factors to consider when making a longer-term investment in a company. The 10-K documents filed on the company's website show that the revenue in the same period has only increased with 75% to around $4.5 billion. Fiserv was able to grow EPS significantly compared to revenue by increasing margins and aggressively buying back stock. Return on equity has been above 15%, while at the same time the company has reduced financial leverage (total assets / equity) from 4.8 to 2.6.The balance sheet makes me slightly cautious. The net debt of $3.1 billion is just below equity ($3.2 billion). Net tangible equity is negative with the total amount of goodwill and intangible assets being more than $5 billion. The company can handle this as its business model requires a very low working capital level (almost 0). Minimal capital requirements are necessary to run and maintain the business. The average annual capital expenditure over the last five years has been $191 million. Average operating cash flow over the same period is $870 million. The company is a free cash flow generator, generating more than $5 in free cash flow per share.Fiserv has a 'sticky' business model. The core processing systems and services provided to banks are used to maintain deposits and accounts. Banks subscribe for these services for a three- to five-year period. The majority of these services is necessary to operate and is non-discretionary in nature. Switching cost are high (think about retraining employees and integrating the outsourced services into the organization). More than 82% of revenue is generated through these repeatable services with gross margins of 45%. The financial institution revenue base is diverse with the 50 largest clients representing less than 25% of the annual revenue.I am impressed with the way management has allocated capital. The acquisition and divesture strategy focused on growing the core processing business and acquiring products it can cross-sell. It sold all of its non-banking businesses like its former insurance business. Over the last years the company made three strategic purchases. The recent acquisition of Open Solutions will further strengthen its industry leading position in core processing. The CheckFree acquisition in 2007 gave the company first mover advantage in the electronic bill payments and the CashEdge acquisition in 2011 opened the market for person-to-person payments. Sensible prices were paid for the acquisitions, for example Open Solutions was purchased for slightly more than 8 times EBITDA.There is no policy of returning capital to shareholders though dividends, neither expects the company to start paying a dividend anytime soon. Capital is moved towards an aggressive stock buy-back program. More than $2 billion has been spent in the last five years on buying back stock and reducing the share counts with 15%. Another 6.2 million shares (~4%) are authorized for re-purchasing under the current program.Fiserv is the dominant market player for core processing services. The biggest competitors are Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) and Jack Henry (NASDAQ:JKHY). Fidelity's recent merger with Metavante gives it the same scale as Fiserv. It is not operating at the same level yet. Margins are significantly lower than Fiserv's (gross margin of 32% versus 42% and operating margin of 19% versus 23%). Jack Henry margins reach the same level as Fiserv's. It doesn't have the same scale as Fiserv, with revenue only being 25% of Fiserv's. In an industry with high switching cost and limited players, scale is an advantage. Fiserv has both scale and the highest margins. This is a great competitive position.The Outlook for 2013 is promising. Following is the outline presented together with the Q4 2012 and full year results:The company is trading with a P/E of 18 and EV/EBITDA of 10. I try to be disciplined in my investment decisions and not initiate positions for more than 8 times EV/EBITDA. If the stock price would come down then I see this as a great investment to benefit from the financial industry recovery. I have added Fiserv to my watch list.Disclosure: I am long BAC, AIG, WFC.

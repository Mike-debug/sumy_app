The traditional on-premise call centers which are largely nothing but telephony is undergoing a significant change. Cloud contact center software is focused on helping customers improve customer service as well as profits by providing a seamless suite of applications for omni-channel (telephone, email, video calls, etc) and automated engagement (virtual customer assistant, chatbox, etc), as well as the data analytics and AI that helps businesses improve decision-making by analyzing aggregate and individual call data. According to Five9 (FIVN), one of the leaders in the cloud contact center industry, only 15% of North American call centers are cloud-based and the global penetration rate should be even lower given North America is usually the leader in cloud adoption. They estimate (as shown below) that the growth runway should be huge, with the market worth $24 billion. Source: Five9 2020 Q1 Investor DayWhile Nice (NICE) have slightly different numbers for their TAM, the image below also demonstrates the high growth that the cloud contact center industry should enjoy in the near future. Source: Nice's 2019 Investor DayAccording to Twilio, the following are some benefits of having a cloud contact center as opposed to the traditional on-premise call center. Not included in the below list, but I feel the most important reason, is that cloud contact centers provide seamless omni-channel capabilities that are increasingly important for customer satisfaction. For all the following reasons, there is a current and rapid transition from on-premise to cloud, with Fonolo declaring in early 2020 that ""we're expecting to see a mass exodus, with as many as 70% of contact centers moving to the cloud in the next 12-24 months.""Cloud is clearly the growth driver for the call/contact center industry with Five9 reporting a 28% YoY increase in revenue for Q1 2020. NICE reported cloud revenue growing 27% YoY while overall revenue only grew 9%, demonstrating its cloud business as the main growth driver. According to both the Gartner Magic Quadrant as well the The Forrester Wave, there are three leaders in the space: Five9, NICE InContact and Genesys, as seen in the below diagram. Source: Five9 Investor DayThis article will be focused on both NICE and Five9 since they're the only public cloud contact center companies. The obvious difference between the two is the latter is a pure cloud contact center provider company, while the former has its legacy contact center business as well as its business in financial crime and compliance. Taking a look at Five9's margins, there's been an improvement from 2017 to 2018 but things became slightly worse in 2019. Slightly worrying is that the decline in margins resulted in only a 27% increase in revenue, which is similar to its 2018 revenue growth of 28.7%. Furthermore, this is with a relatively small revenue base, full year 2019 revenue was around $328 million. This brings up the question of whether Five9 can continue to sustain revenue growth in the 20% region for the next few years while improving margins. The path to profitability has also been far slower than what analysts have predicted. A look at the estimates provided by Mirador Capital in 2018 shows that worsening margins for 2019 was not exactly planned since analysts expected continued improvement in Five9's net income margin. Source: MiradorNICE is transitioning from its legacy contact center business with its cloud business growing at a similar rate to Five9 (28% in 2019) but at a decidedly higher base of $599 million in 2019. More impressively, it has been been able to maintain and even improve its positive operating margins (27.5% in 2019 as compared to 26.4% in 2020) while growing its cloud business. As seen below, its cloud business is becoming an increasingly bigger part of its business which should bode well for future margin improvements. Source: NICE investor relationsFurthermore, given that NICE inContact actually placed higher than Five9 in the list of companies in the cloud contact center industry according to Gartner and Forrester, I am confident that its cloud offering is at least on par with Five9's. Hence, given NICE's stronger margins on similar growth rates for its cloud business, I believe that NICE is a stronger company, especially at current valuations (discussed below). A summary of notable activity in the contact center space (as seen below) is provided by Mirador in their 2018 report on Five9. Of note is the acquisition of Interactive Intelligence by Genesys and InContact by NICE in 2016 since they are both cloud contact center provider companies, which makes Five9 the last standalone pure cloud contact center provider. Interactive Intelligence which was acquired in 2016 reported a 14.5% YoY revenue growth in 2015, but cloud revenue should be higher since it also has some legacy business and was sold at a 2.9x EV/Revenue multiple. InContact which was also acquired in 2016 reported a 34% cloud revenue growth in 2015 with overall revenue growing 24% and was sold for a 3.4x EV/Revenue multiple. On the other hand, Five9 at its current price of $115.35, currently trades at a PE ratio of 155 and a TTM P/S ratio of 20.11. Its current EV/Revenue multiple is also around 20 as it only has $100 million in net cash. Hence the multiple that Five9 trades at is significantly higher than the multiples assigned to InContact and Interactive Intelligence when they were bought in 2016 despite very similar growth rates. Furthermore, the 2.9x multiple paid by Genesys was a 38% premium to Interactive Intelligence's stock price and the 3.4x multiple paid by NICE was a 50% premium to In Contact's stock price!Even NICE itself is currently priced at a premium, with a P/S ratio of around 7.3 despite consolidated revenue growing at a meagre 9%, albeit from a much larger base. NICE is also profitable and generates large amounts of positive cash flow, however the significantly slower revenue growth due to its legacy business laggards should not equate to double the multiple assigned to it. I believe that the expectations due to COVID-19, which according to Five9's CEO in their Q1 2020 earnings call has seen many companies switch to Five9's cloud offerings, have been significantly elevated. It has provided Q2 guidance of around $91 million which is only 18% revenue growth from Q2 2019 revenue of $77 million. While I am interested in both companies and the industry in general, there is clearly a widening gap between reality and expectations which makes the current risk-reward ratio a little too skewed for my liking."
4367740,23468,2020-08-11T18:38:45-04:00,"I respect and value other SA Contributors' extensive reporting of stock fundamentals, and so should you.My contribution is in providing comparison forecasts of likely next few month coming price ranges of such stocks, with evidences of how their prices changed after prior similar forecasts.FIVN is now priced where only 29% of its expected next 3-month price range is to the downside, while MSFT's downside exposure is -40%, which itself is a larger range.Other considerations put the odds-weighted likely outcomes for FIVN at 2½ times as favorable as those for MSFT.Here's the comparison of our daily ranking of Tech Infrastructure stocks' likely near cap-gains, from the forecast population of over 2900 stocks and ETFs, given just one day's changes.","Adequate interest and reporting often produce market-price adjustments providing near-term gain opportunities which swamp returns from ""conventional 'conservative' long-term passive investing"" strategies.Adroit anticipation of such opportunities often has better chances of capture and retention when investor attention and available liquid capital to be directed are employed. This is illustrated in comparisons of Five9, Inc. (FIVN), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Adobe, Inc. (ADBE)Source: AuthorThis map locates securities at the intersection of prospective price gains (green horizontal scale) based on market-maker hedging behavior and potential price drawdowns (red vertical scale) based on actual subsequent market prices. The hedging behavior is necessary to protect their endangerment of firm capital as they enable volume trades. Desirable condition map locations are down and to the right.The ""frontier"" of stocks of best advantage yesterday (8/7/2020) is from the 'market-average"" notion, SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) at [10] to ADBE at [13] to SWI at [17]. Our interest is in FIVN at [15], a bit above ADBE.For slightly less than the same return as ADBE, is undertaking the additional risk exposure in FIVN warranted?Other conditions contributing to reward and risk are spelled out in Figure 2. Principal questions for all alternative investments are ""how likely are these outcomes to happen"", and ""can their impact be improved?""Figure 2 presents the MMs' price range forecasts for the best-ranked alternative investment candidates in Figure 1, along with the histories of outcomes from their prior forecasts of the same proportions of today's up-to-down prospects as occurred at times in the past 5 years of daily forecasts.Figure 2Contributing to that evaluation are the demonstrated odds for a profit-successful forecast in column [H], (by deduction its complement of 100 - H, or loss frequency), size of net gain attained [ I ] and size of worst loss experience [F]. When [ I ] and [F] are appropriately weighted in [O] and [P] they produce the Net of [Q].Respecting the power of compounding, [Q] converted into capital commitment of basis points per day [J] at [R] presents a highly comparable figure of merit (fom) for investing preferences.Figure 2 is row-ranked on [R]'s fom and distinguishes FIVN's odds-weighted capital gain prospects from all of the other stocks.FIVN history following prior Range Indexes of 29 better-than captured today's upside forecast [E] of 14.1% with price gains averaging +14.9%. MSFT's history of prior Range Indexes of 41 only captured +7.3% gains, compared to its today forecast of +15%.In addition, FIVN's Win Odds of profitable outcomes from those forecasts were 7 out of 8, compared to only 6 out of 7 for MSFT. Then an 11% longer position holding period for MSFT (45 market days, 9 weeks) compared to FIVN's 40, or 8 weeks, limited its CAGR [K] to +48%, only about 1/3rd of FIVN's +138%.Putting the comparisons into odds-weighted payoffs of RATE of returns per day in [R] allows us to see that ADBE and other infrastructure stocks can offer meaningful advantage over current buys of MSFT in pursuit of near-term capital gains. For reference, in a 252-day market year, a 27 basis-point per day rate of gain when sustained for a year (regardless of specific source) doubles the capital involved.The strong argument here for an active investing strategy (over a passive one) is supported by the power of multiple compounding of gain opportunities where odds of gain are high. The weakness of passive investing strategies is that ""regression to the mean"" of return ensures low odds of profitable periods of gain to be compounded to offset the high odds of loss for the regression periods. Result: Probability of low passive RATES of return over long periods, compared to high rates of active investment rewards shorter periods persisting during the same long periods.Those reversals are made even more apparent when compared as pictures of FIVN and MSFT price range forecast changes weekly during the past two years in Figure 3.Figure 3used with permissionFIVN in the left picture demonstrates how its price activity provides opportunities to capture and compound on the oft-asserted ""long-term advantage"" of regression to the mean of market actions. With the aid of MM's price range forecasts, calibrating the day's market price into Range Index values, and with TERMD portfolio risk-management discipline capturing and compounding the opportunities, the rationale for the fading of 20th century passive strategies should become clearer.The small lower ""thumbnail"" pictures of the past 5 years daily Range Index frequency distributions add to the odds understanding between securities. The potential for higher RIs (and higher prices) is greater at this point for FIVN than for the more market-disciplined MSFT.In the right-hand picture of MSFT's trend of prices and weekly forecasts of likely coming prices, the market reactions were also near-instantaneous. If you weren't part of the 7/24 trading day, you missed the opportunity for instant gain or possible prevention of instant loss.But with the MMs' hedging actions in response to their client's reactions you now have intelligence inputs as to possible reactions to these developments for many securities. They should lead to far more profitable Active-Investing-Strategy portfolio experiences.Five9, Inc. at current price and profit prospects appears to be an attractive buy for near-term gain, along with future re-evaluations in longer-term repeated experiences."
4351542,104952,2020-06-02T13:51:52-04:00,"The ~18x P/S valuation is reflective of Five9's strong focus and leadership in the contact center software market. It remains the only pure-play CCaaS today.It is a profitable growth story with a deep moat in the enterprise market, driven by its strong channel partner go-to-market.Despite the COVID-19 outbreak in Q1, the company maintained a +27% growth and signed a major deal with AT&T.","We are bullish on Five9 (FIVN), one of the leading players in the CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) space. Since its IPO in 2014, the share price has appreciated by ~17x to ~$104 per share, to reflect the business' strong moat, fundamentals, and execution. Furthermore, it also operates in a highly attractive $24 billion market with strong positioning. We expect to see more upsides in the business as it continues to maintain its strong focus and execution in the enterprise CCaaS market.Five9 is riding the wave of the major digital transformation in the contact center software market. Many enterprises from all sizes are shifting away from the legacy on-premise offering provided by companies like Avaya (OTC:AVYA) and Cisco (CSCO), to a more scalable cloud-based solution/CCaaS. There are a few players with CCaaS offerings, such as RingCentral (RNG), 8x8 (EGHT), and NICE inContact.While some of these players are also offering other business and consumer-oriented UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service) solutions, we think that Five9 is differentiated due to its strong focus on CCaaS. This strong focus will allow the company to maintain its innovation capability and strong go-to-market execution in the enterprise segment and others.(Source: company's Q1 2020 earnings call slide)At present, Five9 is a disruptive enterprise software company with a profitable growth story. In addition to the 33% CAGR since 2009, revenue growth in the last five years has also accelerated by ~500 bps, all while maintaining a consistent margin expansion. Despite the COVID-19 situation in Q1 recently, the company also still posted a solid ~28% revenue growth.(Source: five9.com)The key driver for this profitable growth has been the continuing adoption of its disruptive offering by the enterprise customers across many industries. The number of enterprise customers with >$1 million ARR was 59 in 2019, while there were only 3 in 2014. In addition to Expedia (EXPE) and DHL, Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), and more recently, AT&T (T), are using Five9's offerings.(Source: company's Q1 2020 earnings call slide)Going forward, we see many more upsides as the company seems to be hitting all the right notes when it comes to enterprise sales execution. Five9 has one of the strongest and most effective channel partner lineups we have seen. Based on the management's comments in the Q1 earnings call, the level of master agents and resellers' contributions to overall business has doubled over the last two years, while SIs (System Integrators) like Deloitte have also brought in significantly more deals in Q1 than the whole 2019 combined. Overall, channel partners had contributed to at least 60% of the deals in the pipeline in Q1.In the enterprise setting, we believe that Five9's strong relationship with channel partners will continue to be critical, given their specialized expertise in implementation and delivery that will shorten the traditionally long sales cycle. One of Five9's go-to-market team members with previous experience working for one of them indeed played a key role in closing the AT&T deal in Q1. When asked about the reason why AT&T went with Five9 in Q1, the CEO Trollope attributed this to his team members' experience in channel partners:There is a minor risk factor due to the fragmented, competitive, and broad nature of the contact center market, which also has some overlaps with the customer service and CRM markets. This is why, aside from the direct competition coming from both the legacy, UCaaS, and other CCaaS players, any CRM player can be a future competitor. Zendesk (ZEN), for instance, is one of the channel partners that can also be a competitor. Zendesk even has already had a call center offering, though its long-term focus will still be in the CRM market. As it stands, Five9's strong focus in enterprise CCaaS will ensure that it stays ahead.As we have discussed, the contact center market is a broad and competitive market, where we see various indirect and direct competitors to Five9 with double-digit growth. In one way or another, some of these players are disrupting Avaya, whose P/S is the lowest due to its declining legacy business. RingCentral and 8x8 remain the closest competitors to Five9, considering they also provide CCaaS solutions despite their core focus on UCaaS.(RNG vs. ZEN vs. FIVN vs. VG vs. EGHT vs. AVYA vs. TWLO. source: stockrow)8x8 has been investing a lot in its UCaaS transition in recent times, and as such, it commands a very low multiple of 3.2x P/S. On the other hand, the category leaders such as RingCentral in UCaaS, Twilio (TWLO) in CPaaS, and Five9 in CCaaS, should command the highest valuations. Consequently, Five9's 18x P/S makes sense from that standpoint. Given its strong profitable growth, Five9's P/S has even been in upward trend over the last five years. Driven by the long-term catalysts we discussed, Five9 will continue to be an exciting CCaaS pure-play growth story."
4349926,104608,2020-05-25T15:56:24-04:00,"Five9 reported a good Q1 with revenue growing 28% to ~$95 million, around $5 million above expectations.Management reiterated their 2020 revenue guidance of ~16% growth, which now seems somewhat conservative given the Q1 revenue beat.The stock has traded up ~10% since earnings and is now near all-time highs, though valuation ~16.4x does not appear overly expensive.","Even amidst all of the volatility in the market, Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) has continued to push higher as companies now more than ever embrace cloud-based technology. FIVN is one of the leaders in a market currently disrupting the cloud software for contact centers. Enterprises have trended towards updating legacy software and investing more into cloud-based solutions. FIVN is the only pure-play company at scale looking to further disrupt this market.The company reported strong Q1 earnings with revenue growing 28% and their Rule of 40 score coming in at 42, marking the 8th consecutive quarter of achieving this level. In addition, management reiterated their 2020 revenue guidance despite Q1 coming in ~$5 million above expectations, thus making the full year guidance appear somewhat more conservative.Data by YChartsEven as global economies remain in an uncertain condition, given the global pandemic, companies still need to have their call centers available for customers at all times. More companies are encouraging employees to work from home, and the rise of cloud-based solutions has been at the forefront of investment discussions.Since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, FIVN has seen their stock go up ~10% and is now trading near all-time highs. This has caused valuation to also ramp, with the stock now trading at ~16.4x 2020 revenue and ~14.5x a somewhat conservative 2021 revenue figure. There are many software players in the market that trade at 15x forward revenue or higher, and I believe FIVN has solidified their spot as a company well deserving of a premium valuation.Even with the stock trading near all-time highs, I believe long-term investors will continue to be rewarded as enterprises are constantly looking to shift more of their workload to the cloud. Legacy contact centers which host thousands of representatives in a building could eventually become a thing of the past, given the global pandemic has altered companies' thoughts around their work-from-home policy. For now, I believe FIVN will continue their upward trend as companies will likely increase their cloud usage when it comes to contact centers.Management has previously talked about the market remaining only 10-15% cloud penetrated, and with ~$24 billion of the total global addressable market, there is plenty of room left for FIVN to grow and expand. FIVN competes in the cloud software contact center market, focusing mostly on large enterprises. This market, known as the Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, is an estimated $24 billion industry that remains highly underpenetrated.Source: Company PresentationLegacy vendors have historically focused on building out large call centers. This legacy model invested in people to work the phones and provide customer service. I am sure many readers have an experience calling customer service and speaking with agents. Not all of these experiences are necessarily negative; however, the use of technology has advanced the customer service experience. Another factor of legacy contact center operations is its use of offshore or nearshore operations. Largely held in India and the Philippines, these contact centers play host to hundreds or even thousands of workers.While this offshore work is generally cheaper for the company compared to domestic employees, technology has changed the way contact centers operate. As companies increasingly transition to a work-from-home model, having a cloud-based solution is essential to ensuring a smooth transition.During the quarter, revenue grew an impressive 28% to $95.1 million, which was nicely above expectations for ~$90 million and was consistent with the 28% growth seen last quarter. In addition, 91% of their revenue was recurring, which remains an important aspect for investors especially during a time when global economies are slowing down. The company continues to demonstrate strength within their Enterprise customers, with 81% of LTM revenue coming from Enterprise customers. As contact centers continue to move towards cloud-based operations, Enterprises are more willing to make investments in these areas, ultimately using FIVN's services.Source: Company PresentationGross margin during the quarter came in at 64.1%, which expanded slightly from 63.4% in the year ago period. Over time, I believe gross margins could approach 70% as the company gains scale, and more of their revenue comes from software subscription streams. Given the company continues to invest in their operations, including S&M and R&D, adjusted EBITDA margin during the quarter came in at 14.9%, which was down ~100 basis points from the 15.9% in the year-ago period.Source: Company PresentationOne of the biggest gauges software companies focus on is the Rule of 40, that is the company's revenue growth percentage plus their adjusted EBITDA margin percentage. During Q1, FIVN reported 28% revenue growth and ~15% adjusted EBITDA margin, which led to a Rule of 40 score of 42, marking the 8th consecutive quarter achieving this feat. On top of this, the company continues to increase their internal investments, which has weighed down margins for the past few quarters.The better than expected revenue, combined with continued strong margins, led to EPS of $0.17 during the quarter, which was slightly above expectations for ~$0.15.Source: Company PresentationFor Q2, the company is expecting revenue of $90.5-91.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.15-0.16.For the full year, the company is now expecting revenue of $380.5-383.5 million, which represents ~16% growth compared to 2019. In addition, the revenue guidance was similar to management's previous guidance range, which now makes it seem somewhat conservative. While there could be some pressure in Q2 and Q3, given the global pandemic, Q1 revenue came in ~$5 million ahead of expectations, which gives the company more flexibility for the remainder of the year.In addition, the company reiterated their long-term model during the quarter, which includes gross margin reaching 70%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 27%+. As the company scales and gains efficiencies, they should start to see R&D and G&A expenses start to decline, which will benefit margin expansion.Since reporting earnings, FIVN has been up ~10% over the past few weeks and continues to trade near all-time highs. Given the cloud-based nature of their operations, 90%+ recurring revenue, and companies likely to invest more in cloud-based solutions given the global pandemic, investors have rightfully placed a premium revenue multiple on this name. The cloud-based contact center market remains underpenetrated as there is a lot of growth runway remaining.In addition, FIVN could end up being a potential acquisition target for a larger software or cloud-based player looking to gain more exposure into contact centers. FIVN is the leading pure-play competitor in the cloud-based contact center market, and legacy software players could see FIVN as a good opportunity to diversify their portfolio. With a market cap of ~$6.4 billion, there are several larger legacy players that could add FIVN to their portfolio.FIVN is the largest pure-play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG), 8x8 (EGHT), Bandwidth (BAND), and Vonage (VG).Data by YChartsWith a current market cap of ~$6.4 billion, cash/investments of ~$325 million, and debt of ~$215 million, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$6.3 billion. Management reiterated their 2020 revenue guidance of $380.5-383.5 million, Which represents only ~16% revenue growth. Using the midpoint of their guidance range, this results in a 2020 revenue multiple of ~16.4x.Assuming the company comes in at the midpoint of revenue guidance and then grows ~13% in 2021, we could see 2021 revenue of ~$435 million, which would imply a 2021 revenue multiple of ~14.5x. Given the rapid change in companies' preferences to cloud-based technology solutions amid the global pandemic, I believe the above growth rates could end up being conservative and revenue could grow 15-20% over the next few years.While valuation currently remains at a premium, there are many other cloud-based stocks that trade at 15x or higher forward revenue multiples given their consistency and recurring revenue base. FIVN could experience a significant increase in demand over the coming quarters and years and enterprises transition to cloud-based models amidst employees working from home more often. The company remains the leading pure-play competitor in the cloud-based contact center market and is poised to capture additional market share in an underpenetrated market.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited."
4349703,105400,2020-05-22T20:49:51-04:00,Five9 has been growing its revenue steadily due to a strong leadership position in the contact center software space.The company's gross margins have also been improving due to its platform stickiness.But Five9's valuation appears expensive based on consensus estimates.,"Five9 Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FIVN) stock price has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, returning 1,792% compared to the S&P's 54% over the past 5 years. This is mainly due to the company's steady growth and gross margin improvements. Growth and improvements have mainly been driven by Five9's strong value proposition and an extensive partner ecosystem. Five9 appears to be overvalued relative to its peers based on consensus estimates.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)Customer expectations are at an all-time high. 84% of end customers say being treated like a person, not a number, is very important to winning their business. To help companies in this area, Five9 delivers a comprehensive, end-to-end cloud software solution for contact centres. Five9 provides an omnichannel platform for companies to interact with their customers with a single unified view. Their modern engagement platform also intelligently routes customers to agents that best address needs. With this value proposition and its strong operations in place, Five9 has been named a leader in the cloud contact centre software.(Source: Investor Presentation)This strong leadership position has enabled the customers to expand their enterprise customers with annual recurring revenue of greater than $1M from 3 in Q2 2014 to 59 in Q4 2019. Five9 also experiences strong unit economics where $1 in customer acquisition cost turns into over $6 in cumulative profit over 5 years. This has enabled revenue to grow from $43M in 2014 to $349M in fiscal 2020, representing a 26% compounded annual growth. The growth rate for the company has also been accelerating steadily, from 22% in 2014 to 27% in 2019.Despite the steady growth, Five9 still has a long runway for growth. At their current revenues of $349M, they have only penetrated roughly 1.4% of their current total addressable market. With $210B spent on contact centre labour, there is also room for the contact centre software market to grow as digital transformation takes place in companies. Five9 has several growth opportunities to capture this market, such as expanding internationally and extending the platform. With such a large market, we can expect that Five9 should have steady growth in the years ahead.(Source: Investor Presentation)The company has built a robust ecosystem of partners, including a variety of leading CRM software vendors such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This ecosystem helps Five9 increase their brand awareness and stickiness with their customers. As companies use more integrated solutions with Five9 and its partner companies, it is unlikely they would switch providers due to time and risk. Customers wouldn't want to incur lost productivity or risk data migration issues if the competitive solution is not significantly better.(Source: Investor Presentation)This customer stickiness is reflected in Five9's retention rate at 103%, and recurring revenue at 91%. Recurring revenue helps Five9 smooth its cash flow, which provides better planning visibility for future projects. Furthermore, this retention level is not due to high customer concentration since no single client makes up more than 5% of Five9's revenue. This robust ecosystem has strengthened Five9's competitive position and potentially improved its pricing power. This is reflected in the company's gross margin, which has grown from 43% in 2011 to 59% in 2019.(Source: Investor Presentation)Five9 has $326M of cash and short-term investments. This should provide some support against the $212M of convertible senior notes when it comes due. Furthermore, the company generated $9.5M of free cash flow in the latest fiscal year. In recessionary periods, it might be difficult to raise cash. Therefore, Five9's positive free cash flow and strong liquidity position should be able to support any potential operational difficulties during this period.(Source: 10Q)The current climate might reduce the demand for contact centre software as companies around the world experience falling demand. However, Five9 appears to be fine according to their recent quarterly report:(Source: 10Q)Despite the company's optimism, there will likely be heightened uncertainty during this period.The company's success also depends heavily on its ability to maintain the stability, security, and performance of their infrastructure. Any failure to do so might lead to direct lost revenues in the form of credit rebates and indirect lost revenues from reputational damage. If the infrastructure does not provide high-quality customer experience, companies might switch from Five9 to other providers.Based on relative valuation, Five9 appears expensive when using its EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples. The company's consensus EBITDA margin is 15.9% compared to the median of 23.1%. Five9's consensus revenue growth of 16.6% is also lower than the median of 17.2%. However, its EV/revenue is 16.5x compared to the median of 6.7x. Its EV/EBITDA of 103.8x is also higher than the median of 36.3x. For Five9 to justify its valuation, it appears that the company would have to significantly outperform the consensus estimates of revenue growth or EBITDA margin.(Source: Atom Finance)For Five9 to continue outperforming, the company has to ensure that its value proposition is strong relative to the competition. Five9 also has to maintain the structural integrity of its platform, so it does not face any reputational issues that could negatively impact its leadership position. Valuation appears to be steep at the moment, so investors could determine if they would prefer to wait for a larger margin of safety."

When the market speaks, you should listen.","Five9, Inc. (FIVN) is one of my favorite stocks at the moment. I expect that Five9 will navigate the pandemic quite nicely and, longer term, will benefit from the enterprise shift to the cloud, which is still in the early innings. Adding icing to the cake, the Five9 stock price is breaking out to an all-time high. As I like to say: ""when the market speaks you want to listen.""I have written two previous articles on Five9, the most recent being written three months ago, long before the coronavirus pandemic was a thing. I gave Five9 a very bullish rating and have been rewarded with a 27% gain versus the S&P 500 which lost more than 14% in the same time period.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Five9 was ""born in the cloud"", offering cloud-based contact center software. This company has no legacy hardware-based solutions to weigh on its performance. In fact, Five9's annual revenue growth is a decent 27% and has been pretty steady for the last 5 years.(Source: Portfolio123)Not only is Five9's revenue growth rate steady but also its free cash flow margin, which has hovered around 10% for the last 1 1/2 years.(Source: Portfolio123)The enterprise segment now accounts for more than 80% of Five9's revenue, and enterprise subscriptions are growing by 34% YoY.(Source: Five9)The large proportion of enterprise customers should prove beneficial during the pandemic as I expect enterprises to fair much better than small businesses. While it remains to be seen whether Five9 will come out ahead during this difficult time, the company appears to be quite active as new and existing customers are shifting to remote operations:While I expect that Five9 will hold its own during the pandemic, I believe that the company's long-term outlook is quite promising. Enterprises are in the early stages of contact center transformation from physical to cloud-based.The transformation is being driven by the desire for businesses to integrate their customer relationship management (CRM) with other functionality, including their contact center and collaboration tools.Physical contact centers also require a great deal of support/maintenance and tend to be upgraded on roughly an eight to ten-year cycle. As enterprises see the need to replace their existing contact center solution, the no-brain decision is to move to the cloud, which is an easy transition, allowing the contact center to be integrated with not only the CRM application but also with emerging collaboration tools such as video conferencing. Five9 has a strong partner ecosystem:I expect that the market for virtual contact centers will be strong for the foreseeable future. One report estimates that the cloud-based contact center market will grow at a CAGR of 24.5% until 2025. Five9 is a leader in this market segment.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher growth stocks are valued more than lower growth stocks and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Five9 stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Five9 is situated above the best-fit line; in fact, above the +1 standard deviation (green) line. This suggests that Five9 is significantly overvalued on a relative basis.However, when I perform a similar evaluation by substituting next year's earnings estimate/EV for EV/forward sales estimate, then I come to the conclusion that Five9 is fairly valued.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Therefore, I believe that Five9 is overvalued based on its EV/forward sales multiple, but I am refining that assessment based on the company's earnings estimate for next year. The stock is reasonably valued so long as the company produces the valuation is not a problem.I have assumed that Five9's leadership in the virtual contact center market will be a net benefit during the pandemic and the seismic shift to work-from-home. It is very possible that Five9 does not thrive in this environment or that a global recession impedes the company's revenue growth.The stock price is frothy if one considers the sales multiple in isolation while not considering anticipated future earnings. If Five9 cannot maintain margins going forward, then I would expect the stock price to drop.Five9 is moving to the public cloud for its international operations. The public cloud has a higher cost associated with it, but is also more agile. This initiative may reduce operating margins in the future.Five9 is operating in a very competitive market and may not come out the winner. In fact, the company could lose market share to one of its competitors.This is my third article on Five9, the most recent article being very bullish on Five9's prospects. I continue to like Five9's future. I believe that Five9's virtual contact center offering will thrive in the current economic setting which is dominated by a mass shift to work-from-home. Five9 can move a customer to the cloud in less than 48 hours and has been doing so for thousands of agents.Longer term, I can see Five9 benefiting from the enterprise shift to the cloud, integration with CRM, and collaboration tools that are already cloud-based. Five9 has steady and fairly strong annual revenue growth of 27% and a steady positive free cash flow margin of approximately 10%.The stock has a high EV/S valuation but also has a nominal forward earnings/EV ratio. Given that the stock price is in breakout mode, fundamentals are good, and the company's future appears to be sound, I am giving Five9 a bullish rating."
4338831,104608,2020-04-21T12:08:22-04:00,Five9 remains the leading pure-play competitor in the cloud-based software market for contact centers.Enterprises are increasing their workloads to the cloud and the novel COVID-19 virus could accelerate these trends.Valuation does not appear aggressive compared to other leading software companies.,"While the stock has surged to all-time highs over the past few weeks, Five9 (FIVN) may still have a lot of room left for additional growth. FIVN is one of the leaders who are currently disrupting the cloud software market for contact centers. Enterprises have trended towards updating legacy software and investing more into cloud-based solutions. FIVN is the only pure-play company at scale looking to further disrupt this market.Yes, the global economy remains in flux as the novel COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread around the world and has caused economies to essentially shut down. However, companies still need to have call centers available for customers when questions arise. Especially during a time when more companies are requiring employees to work from home, having a cloud-based solution makes this transition easy and smooth. FIVN could become the gold-standard for contact center companies, who traditionally have large in-person facilities.Data by YChartsIn addition, consumers will still need to dial call centers in order to get their questions answered. Think of when you purchase an airline ticket and then need to cancel. While some may find it easiest to do everything online, a large majority of consumers will still want to contact a representative to walk through their options. This is the same for consumers who purchase a new television and are having operational troubles. They will utilize a call center to get their questions answered.I have liked FIVN for a while as they are the leading software-based contact center player looking to disrupt this largely legacy technology market. Valuation has ramped over the past several quarters as the company has proved they are able to generate 25%+ revenue growth on top of 15%+ adjusted EBITDA margins. Even with the stock up over 60% since early March, I believe FIVN will continue their upward trend as companies will likely increase their cloud usage when it comes to contact centers.Management has previously talked about the market remaining only 10-15% cloud penetrated, and with ~$24 billion of the total global addressable market, there is plenty of room left for FIVN to grow and expand. FIVN competes in the cloud software contact center market, focusing mostly on large enterprises. This market, known as the Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, is an estimated $24 billion industry that remains highly underpenetrated.Source: Company PresentationLegacy vendors have historically focused on building out large call centers. This legacy model invested in people to work the phones and provide customer service. I am sure many readers have an experience calling customer service and speaking with agents. Not all of these experiences are necessarily negative; however, the use of technology has advanced the customer service experience. Another factor of legacy contact center operations is its use of offshore or nearshore operations. Largely held in India and the Philippines, these contact centers play host to hundreds or even thousands of workers.While this offshore work is generally cheaper for the company compared to domestic employees, technology has changed the way contact centers operate. As companies increasingly transition to a work-from-home model, having a cloud-based solution is essential to ensuring a smooth transition.During the quarter, revenue grew 28% to $92.3 million with 91% of their revenue being recurring, which has become an important part of the company especially during a time when global economies are slowing down. FIVN continues to show strength in their Enterprise customers, which represent ~80% of recurring revenue. As contact centers continue to move towards cloud-based operations, Enterprises are more willing to make investments in these areas, ultimately using FIVN's services.Source: Company PresentationDespite the increased investments that currently have a negative impact on the company's margins, they are still seeing success in expanding over time. In addition, the company reiterated their long-term model during their recent analyst day. This model includes gross margin reaching 70%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 27%+. As the company scales and gains efficiencies, they should start to see R&D and G&A expenses start to decline.During the most recent quarter, the company had revenue growth of 28% and EBITDA margin of 21%, resulting in a Rule of 40 score of 49. This marked the 7th quarter in a row of achieving this score, a rather impressive figure considering the company is approaching a revenue run-rate of $500 million.While 2020 guidance may not hold as much confidence as it did a few weeks ago due to the changing environment, management’s initial 2020 guidance included revenue of $380.5-383.5 million, which represented growth of ~16%, which seemed conservative given recent quarterly growth rates of 25%+. In addition, due to the influx of call volumes as volatility in the economy persists, I believe FIVN could ultimately report another year of 20%+ growth.Even though the stock has been up ~60% over the past few weeks to all-time highs, FIVN is not unfamiliar with a premium valuation. Given the cloud-based nature of their operations and 90%+ recurring revenue, investors have historically placed a premium revenue multiple on this name. The cloud-based contact center market remains underpenetrated as there is a lot of growth runway remaining.Investors should also not cross off FIVN being a potential acquisition target either. Given many companies are transitioning to the cloud and FIVN is a pure-play leader in the contact center market, legacy software companies could see FIVN as a good opportunity to diversify their portfolio. With a market cap of only ~$5 billion, there are several legacy players that could add FIVN to their portfolio in order to gain exposure to cloud-based contact centers.FIVN is the largest pure-play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG), 8x8 (EGHT), Bandwidth (BAND), and Vonage (VG).Data by YChartsWith a current market cap of ~$5.7 billion, cash of ~$300 million and debt of ~200 million, the company has a current enterprise value of $5.6 billion. Even though 2020 revenue guidance is only ~16%, I believe there is a disconnection given the rapid change in the global economy over the past few weeks. Investors are wise to believe this guidance changes during their upcoming Q1 earnings report. However, I am inclined to believe their original guidance was slightly conservative and we could see another year of 20%+ revenue growth.Management’s initial 2020 revenue guidance was $380.5-383.5 million, which implies a 2020 revenue multiple of ~14.7x. While this remains a premium, there are many other cloud-based stocks that trade at 15x or higher forward revenue multiples given their consistency and recurring revenue base.FIVN could experience a significant increase in demand over the coming quarters and years and enterprises transition to cloud-based models amidst employees working from home more often. The company remains the leading pure-play competitor in the cloud-based contact center market and is poised to capture additional market share in an underpenetrated market.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited."

Five9 (FIVN), a leading provider of cloud software for contact centers, recently announced its fourth-quarter results that surpassed market expectations.For the fourth quarter, Five9's revenues grew 28% to $92.3 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $86.53 million. GAAP net income was $0.8 million, compared with a net income of $3.7 million last year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $0.27 per share, compared with net income of $0.23 per share a year ago and ahead of the market's forecast of $0.22 per share.Five9 ended the year with revenues growing 27% over the year to $328 million. It reported a net loss of $4.6 million for the year compared with a net loss of $0.2 million reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, net income was $0.82 per share, compared with $0.60 reported last year.For the first quarter, Five9 expects revenues of $89-90 million with EPS of $0.15-0.16. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $380.5-383.5 million and EPS of $0.83-0.87. The market was looking for revenues of $86.93 for the quarter with EPS of $0.15 and revenues of $371.61 million for the year with EPS of $0.85.Five9 has been making strategic acquisitions to drive its growth. In November last year, it announced the acquisition of Whendu's iPaaS platform for an undisclosed sum. Whendu's platform has been built for the contact center industry. It accelerates the migration of contact center to the cloud by simplifying the process of integration of existing environment to the cloud. It is a no-code, visual application workflow tool with more than 50 out-of-the box application connectors that are ready to use for the contact centers. These integrations create real-time streams of data, which can be aggregated to build real-time automatic and responsive workflows.More recently, Five9 announced the acquisition of Virtual Observer, a native cloud SaaS provider of workforce optimization. Formerly known as CSI, Virtual Observer has been a long-term partner for Five9 offering its Workforce Optimization (WFO) solutions. WFO solutions help improve contact center operational efficiency while driving improved customer experiences. Five9 plans to leverage the acquisition to expand its offerings to now include a cloud-based and integrated WFO offering. Prior to the acquisition, Virtual Observer was privately held. It did not disclose its financial details or the acquisition price.Five9 has been focusing on improving its platform capabilities. The recent addition of Whendu will add to its iPaaS capabilities. Additionally, the company has also been leveraging its product and engineering teams to continue to add to the platform. Over the course of the previous year, Five9 has strengthened its CRM and partner integrations and made the platform increasingly open through enhanced APIs and SDKs. It also launched an App Marketplace late last year where it showcases its partner integrations. The App Marketplace covers over 10 categories, providing customers with access to services ranging from AI support, CRM, unified communications, workforce optimization, and messaging. Five9 realizes that the Marketplace helps its ISV partners to seamlessly integrate into Five9 and, in turn, builds valuable extensions to its own platform.Five9 stock is currently trading at $73.21 with a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. It touched a year high of $80.58 earlier last month.

4326589,21815,2020-02-24T09:09:15-05:00,"The company's Q4 came in considerably better than expected, initially lifting the shares, which then succumbed to market turmoil.We are convinced the company has strong tailwinds and a significant market opportunity ahead of it, although we don't see much room for further valuation multiple expansion.Despite the bright outlook, we don't think now is an opportune time to buy. Wait until the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak becomes more clear.","We argued last November that Five9 (FIVN), a market leader of cloud contact centers, was benefiting from a massive shift to the cloud. Q4 results, which came in better than expected, have buttressed our bullishness, but while we're not changing our view on the company nor its bright future, we're getting considerably more cautious with relation to the stock price.The shares have benefited from a continuous valuation multiple expansion that we can't see to continue for much longer, and we don't think now is a particularly opportune time to buy given the valuation and the uncertainty around the economic impact of the coronavirus.There are three basic tailwinds that help the company grow:We have discussed the first two in previous articles and are sort of self-explanatory, although it can be summed up pretty easily. In essence, digitalization and a move to a cloud platform allows integrating all customer interaction on a single pane, which allows agents to offer better customer service (from the earnings deck):And:This is how Five9 has ended up as the leading contact center platform (from the earnings deck):But as you can see there are at least two serious competitors, Nice inContact (NICE) and Genesys (which is a private company). Five9 grows considerably faster than Nice:Data by YChartsThe company has multiple avenues to keep growing (from the earnings deck):The company has lots of logos and adds new ones all the time (they discussed a few during the Q4CC), especially enterprise customers with ARR over $1 million a year, of which they have 59 generating 81% of revenues (from the earnings deck):The company boasted a net dollar expansion rate of 105%, down a bit from 107% in Q3 but indicating considerable up-selling.Its channel partners consist of several different parties (from the earnings deck):The channel was good for over 60% of new deals, with system integrators especially important, as they help big clients in their digital transformation, of which Five9 is often a part. The pipeline for deals coming through the system integrators is accelerating, according to management.One of the advantages of having cloud contact centers is that integration with other systems is easier, and the company has two main avenues here:On the latter, from the Q4CC:Internationally, there is still a lot to win, as this a relatively small part of revenues comes from overseas customers, but the company is investing significantly in expanding its sales headcount by almost 50% and overseas revenue grew 45% in 2019.The company's investments in R&D is paying off, as it was able to add more than 90 new features to its platform in 2019.Five9 is also working on its own AI solutions (rather than acquiring these), and its first product, agent assistance, is in beta with a few lead customers. The company hopes to roll out agent assistance in H2 this year.Acquisitions also add to the functionality of the platform, and there were two recent ones:While Virtual Observer has some revenue (and higher gross margins than Five9), these are tuck-in technology acquisitions expanding the functionality of the platform.In fact, Five9 keeps on working with other WFOs as well, as Virtual Observer is mostly for smaller companies with less complex demands.The company produced a 6% revenue beat with revenues coming in at $92.3 million (+28%) and a 5-cent non-GAAP EPS beat, coming in at $0.27. These were good results leading to an initial boost in the share price to $80, which quickly reversed on market turmoil:From the earnings PR:Data by YChartsThere is a long-term trend of rising subscriptions which boost gross margins, as that's the revenue part generating the highest margins. But that has mostly run its course, as it's now 91% of revenue.Professional services (the other 9% of revenue) generated positive gross margins for the first time, so there is a small contribution from that development.While operational margins are positive, there isn't yet much in the form of operational leverage, as the company keeps on investing in growth.It will continue to do that, as near-term investments in the move to the cloud and integrating Virtual Observer will even lower gross margins a bit.The company works on a hybrid cloud model which is part public and part private (its own hosted servers) cloud. CapEx will increase 200bp to 8% of revenue in 2020 as a result of investment in cloud facilities, much of it to facilitate growth abroad.On the other hand, the company has doubled the number of developers in the last 18 months, and management argues that this will start to pay off this year with an acceleration in new product features.Of course, the above margin figures are in GAAP; in non-GAAP there is more operational leverage (albeit measured over a long period, since the IPO in Q2 2014). From the earnings deck:Data by YChartsCash flow is trending upwards nicely - Q4 operating cash flow was $15.6 million and a record $51.2 million for the full year, with CapEx at $20.5 million. The company had $319.9 million in cash and equivalents and $196.5 million in debt at the end of Q4.Data by YChartsDilution has been gradual but consistent, and stock-based compensation has taken off to nearly 13% of revenue, which is quite considerable even if we've seen worse.Its own guidance produces a non-GAAP EPS of $0.83-0.87 for this year, which gives the company a quite ridiculous earnings multiple, but that's not unusual for this type of company still investing heavily in growth, so this doesn't worry us.What does worry us is that much of the company's remarkable stock performance has come from valuation multiple expansion:Data by YChartsWe really wonder whether this can be continued, or even sustained.Five9's high and rising valuation multiple is the result of the company:We have no doubt this is a terrific company which is set to continue to grow reliably, and at some stage when it has reached a more mature level of market penetration, investments will taper and operational leverage will start to kick in.We do not see much, if any, room for further valuation multiple expansion, so further stock price advances have to come from improving company metrics. These are unlikely to disappoint, but there is room for disappointment:The main risk is coming from the coronavirus outbreak slowing deal-making, especially overseas. An additional risk is general market sentiment falling foul to a coronavirus-induced economic slowdown given the substantial valuation the shares are enjoying.We somehow feel that the chances of that are increasing, so we don't think now is the time to buy."

The company can replicate much of its success internationally as well.We see growth unabated, helped by additional operational leverage but not much room for valuation multiple expansion, making the shares still attractive.","We wrote a month ago about Five9 (FIVN), the leader in the cloud contact center market, arguing that the shares offered a good entry point, had more to run and that's what's happened, a bit quicker than we expected. Considering the market reaction to the Q3 figures these were excellent:And indeed the Q3 figures were excellent so let's start off there.From the 10-Q:The quarter came in strong, with revenues beating by $5.1M to $$83.8M and non-GAAP EPS coming in 5 cents better than expected at $0.20, driven by enterprise which brings in 80% of LTM revenues.Its commercial business (smaller customers bringing in the other 20% of LTM revenues) isn't growing so fast with growth in the single-digits.Recurring revenues are 91% of revenues, the rest is brought in by professional services (which still generates negative gross margins). The dollar net retention rate was 107%.There is a considerable gap between the GAAP loss ($1.38M) and the non-GAAP profit ($13.7M) which is due to stock-based compensation ($11.67M) and the amortization of discount and issuance cost on the convertible senior notes ($3.3M).Q4:2019:2020:This implies a considerable slowdown in 2020, but management reassured it's just conservative guidance. The company also has a long-term operating model (from the earnings deck):We have discussed the main growth drivers already in our previous article, but here is an overview from the earnings deck:Here is some additional color from the Q3CC on some of these.The company's success is almost entirely the result of the enterprise market. The company gets 60% of its sales from channel partners of which the systems integrators (the Deloitte, Earnest & Young and IBMs of this world) are increasingly important.And what these system integrators are telling its clients is to go digital and to embrace the cloud. This matters a great deal as cloud penetration in customer centers is less than 15% with a TAM of $24B, there is a massive opportunity to get customers off their limited legacy applications into the cloud and the system integrators are an important catalyst for this shift.Companies also increasingly recognize that their customer service experience is essential, and the on-premise legacy solutions are limited and inflexible. These developments are increasingly favoring top cloud contact center providers like Five9, which is raking it with the enterprise sector, which constitutes 80% of its revenue:From the earnings deck:An important reason for enterprise customer satisfaction is that the company is still doing most of the implementation itself, ensuring quality and trust. However, given the increased importance of the system integrators, this is likely to shift a little (Q3CC):The enterprise sector grew 36% in Q3 and management foresees years of 30%+ growth ahead. As a reminder, it isn't actually so easy to thrive in the enterprise segment (Q3CC):The recent acquisition of Whendu’s iPaaS Platform makes a shift to the cloud significantly easier for potential customers. This looks like a pretty important acquisition which could accelerate adoption of the company's cloud platform.We discussed the importance of partners in our last article, here are the five different types (earnings deck):The company entered a strategic agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) which has selected Five9 as a strategic contact center partner to deeply integrate the Five9 Intelligent Cloud Contact Center platform with Microsoft Teams, from the Q3CC:And starting a marketplace just a couple of days ago (PR, our emphasis)With such a wide partner community and ecosystem the company becomes ever more ingrained, which is difficult for competitors to match.A future growth vector is likely to be the use of AI, as the company has some 5B minutes in recorded customer interaction from which machine learning can distill algorithms that can assist operators (or even automate part of the response).There are currently five large trials ongoing and here is an update on the progress (Q3CC):We don't think this will bring huge revenues soon, but some will be trickling in fairly soon (Q3CC):AI does serve as a competitive differentiator as few will be able to match the amount of data that the company has generated and continues to generate, especially the legacy on-premise solutions providers will face hurdles reproducing this.From the 10-Q:Overseas revenue constitutes less than 10% of revenue; there clearly is a huge opportunity here and management argues that basically the infrastructure is already in place to boost international growth (Q3CC):Before one assumes the company hosts everything on its own servers (Q3CC):Not surprisingly, the strong revenue growth has improved margins over time; from the earnings deck:Data by YChartsGrowth and margin expansion have led to a significant amount of cash flow generation, although one has to keep in mind the company pays a considerable amount of stock-based compensation (which actually exceeds the free cash flow):Data by YChartsDilution has been fairly substantial, and the company does have a substantial debt at $206.3M, although it also sits on lots of cash and equivalents ($321M).Data by YChartsValuation has gradually crept up a lot and 12x EV/S is a considerable multiple. While this is backwards-looking with the 2020 multiple at 10 (based on 2020 revenue of $368M, $115M in net cash and a market cap of $3.8B), there will be additional shares from incentive pay (2.6M from outstanding options) and the outstanding convertible notes.Analysts expect a (non-GAAP) EPS of $0.78 this year rising to $0.86 the next. The latter seems unduly low to us, we would expect earnings growth to exceed the 25% revenue growth the company is cruising on, given the operational leverage.The company is a recognized market leader doing particularly well with enterprise customers. This market is still in the early innings, with less than 15% of the market having made the transition to the cloud.We see little reason for this secular tailwind to slow down anytime soon and see further operational leverage as a result. We don't see much room for valuation multiple expansion though, so the shares will rise with earnings, in our view. That's still a nice perspective."

Enterprises are constantly looking for ways to update their legacy software and invest more into cloud-based solutions. FIVN is the only pure-play company at scale looking to further disrupt this market.The company reported a strong Q3 earnings and recently reiterated their long-term model during their analyst day. Revenue growth during Q3 grew 28% and management raised their 2019 expectations to ~25% growth for the year. In addition, the company talked about being comfortable with the 15% revenue growth expectations for 2020, which I believe is a conservative way to set the bar heading into the new year.While the stock was strong and has popped nearly 20% since earnings, valuation has now reached a level where I remain on the sidelines waiting for a better entry point. At ~10.6X 2020 revenue, I think valuation is the biggest risk to the name as companies with high valuations tend to be the first ones to drop during a weak market.Source: YChartsI have liked FIVN for a while as they are the leading software-based contact center player looking to disrupt this largely legacy technology market. Valuation has ramped over the past several quarters as the company has proved they are able to generate 25%+ revenue growth on top of 15%+ adjusted EBITDA margins.However, after seeing the recent 20% pop in the stock, I would be hesitant to put new money to work on this name given where valuation currently stands. If you already have a position in the name, I would not look to sell, rather I would wait for a better opportunity to add to the name over time.Management has previously talked about the market remaining only 10-15% cloud penetrated, and with ~$24 billion of total global addressable market, there is plenty of room left for FIVN to grow and expand. FIVN competes in the cloud software contact center market, focusing mostly on large enterprises. This market, known as the Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, is an estimated $24 billion industry that remains highly underpenetrated.Source: Company PresentationLegacy vendors have historically focused on building on large call centers. This market historically invested in people to work the phones and provide customer service. I am sure many readers have an experience calling customer service and speaking with agents. Not all of these experiences are necessarily negative; however, the use of technology has advanced the customer service experience. Another factor of legacy contact center operations is its use of offshore or nearshore operations. Largely held in India and Philippines, these contact centers play host to hundreds or even thousands of workers. While this offshore work is generally cheaper for the company compared to domestic employees, technology has changed the way contact centers operate.During the quarter, revenue grew 28% to $83.8 million and was ahead of expectations for ~$78.5 million. The impressive revenue growth also showed some acceleration from the 27% growth last quarter and was better than management's previous guidance of $78.0-79.0M. The company continues to show strength in their Enterprise customers, which represent ~80% of recurring revenue. As contact centers continue to move towards cloud-based operations, Enterprises are more willing to make investments in these areas, ultimately using FIVN's services.Over the past 12 months, Enterprise subscription revenue has increased 36%, which is better than the company's overall revenue growth. With management talking about their pipeline remaining strong, we could see continued success within the Enterprise segment for quite some time.Source: Company PresentationIn addition to 91% of revenue being recurring, the company also posted a 107% net dollar-based retention rate during the quarter, similar to the past several quarters. This consistency demonstrates the company's strength not only within their Enterprise clients but also among their Commercial clients.The one disappointment to the quarter was seeing both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margins contract. Gross margin was 64.0% during the quarter, down from 64.3% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA saw a slightly bigger decline as the company continues to invest in R&D and their go-to-market strategies. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.0% compared to 19.5% in the year-ago period.Source: Company PresentationDespite the increased investments that currently have a negative impact on the company's margins, there are still seeing success in expanding over time. In addition, the company reiterated their long-term model during their recent analyst day. This model includes gross margin reaching 70%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 27%+. As the company scales and gains efficiencies, they should start to see R&D and G&A expenses start to decline.Source: Company PresentationThe chart above was presented during the company's recent analyst day and does a great job demonstrating the pay-off between investments and revenue growth. During 2014-2015, the company was investing heavily in their operations in order to generate strong and recurring revenue growth for the long term. Fast forward to Q3, revenue growth of 28% combined with 18% adjusted EBITDA margins led to a Rule of 40 score of 46. This marked the 6th quarter in a row of achieving this score, a rather impressive figure considering the company is approaching a revenue run-rate of $500 million.However, this growth will not last into perpetuity and as revenue growth eventually decelerates, I think investors should expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand towards the company's long-term model of 27%+.For 2019, revenue is now expected to be $321.7-322.7 million, up from $312.5-314.5 million, which now represents ~25% growth for the full year. Although the big raise was no surprise here, it underscores management's continued strength in the business. In addition, the company talked about current expectations for 2020 seeming to be close to consensus, which is expecting ~15% revenue growth. However, I believe this is their first stab at a conservative guidance.With 2019 revenue growth expected to be ~25%, a deceleration to 15% would be a rather large slowdown. However, the company has a history of setting conservative guidance and their continued investment in R&D and into their Enterprise customers could ultimately generate stronger revenue growth in the out years.With the recent strength in the stock post-earnings, up nearly 20%, valuation continues to expand and get more expensive. While I believe there is a lot of room left in this market for expansion and growth, investors also need to consider current valuation in relation to both growth trajectory and competitors. Revenue growth of 25% in 2019 is very strong, though 2020 revenue growth is settling in to be a little lower. Even if we see another year of 20%+ revenue growth, the deceleration is never an attractive feature to valuation.FIVN is the largest pure-play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG), 8x8 (EGHT), Bandwidth (BAND), and Vonage (VG).Data by YChartsRNG's valuation has popped as of recently due to their newly announced partnership with Avaya and expanded relationship with AT&T (T). The Avaya partnership is interesting as it places RNG as the exclusive UCaaS provider to Avaya, a leading communications company. As that partnership starts to develop, I think FIVN could be a benefactor as enterprises look to upgrade their contact center solutions and update to cloud-based solutions.With a current market cap of ~$4.0 billion, cash of ~$120 million and debt of ~205 million, the company has a current enterprise value of $4.08 billion. 2019 revenue growth is expected to be ~25% for the full year and management talked about being comfortable with current 2020 estimates for ~15% growth. I believe 15% growth is a conservative bar to set to begin the year and we could ultimately see another year of 20%+ growth.Assuming 20% growth in 2020, this would give us 2020 revenue of ~$385 million, which would imply a 2020 revenue multiple of ~10.6x. After the stock's near 20% push since reporting earnings and confirming their long-term model during their analyst day, it seems like valuation has reached a point where it is fully pricing in a strong 2020 performance.Also, while ~10.6x a 2020 revenue doesn't seem overly aggressive, valuations of the selected peer group remain high and at a premium. This segment of the communications industry is poised to grow given the demand trends around upgrading legacy communications platforms. While I like the stock over the long-term, the post-earnings stock pop has led me to stay on the sidelines with new money until there is a better entry point.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited."

The shares are off the highs set in the aftermath of excellent Q2 figures, and have slumped back like so many other technology growth names:We think Five9's growth perspectives are undimmed, as confirmed by very good Q2 results, and the company has moved into profitability, with valuations at pretty reasonable levels. For a longer-term perspective:Data by YChartsThere are a number of tailwinds that are happening almost irrespective of what the company does, like:It's no surprise that the public cloud is increasingly adopted by companies in their digital transformation, as solutions are eminently scalable and the sophistication of tools and solutions has increased dramatically.The company still host solutions on its own servers, but management has argued that the economics have shifted in favor of the public cloud. The transformation seems to go through a blended model (Q2CC):The importance of the cloud is further buttressed by Gartner suspending its Magic Quadrant for on-premise contact centers, and how the cloud transforms call center business has been succinctly described by Capital Market Laboratories:With channels multiplying and consumer expectations rising, customer service is becoming of strategic importance to a host of companies. From the Q2CC:The market is huge with a TAM of $24 billion and under 15% penetration, as most active support centers are still telephone-based or legacy on-premise solutions, like those from Avaya (OTC:AVYA) and Cisco (CSCO).The company's most serious competitor is NICE Ltd. (NICE). From the earnings deck:There is a similar slide from Gartner in the earnings deck. Management argues that the market is basically a duopoly with NICE, and it argues that Five9 wins 75% of the deals it competes in. From Capital Market Laboratories:Five9 is benefiting from multiple growth drivers. From the earnings deck:Most of the company's growth is coming from enterprise (large) customers. From the earnings deck:The channel partners are certainly contributing to growth, being responsible for bringing in 60% of the gains in Q2, which is above the trend. The company has a myriad of channel partners of different kinds. From the earnings deck:As the slide above illustrates, there are different categories of partners, with the CRM and Technology players supplying joint integrated products. The advantages of integrating CRM and call centers is pretty obvious, but (Q2CC):Others like the system integrators help with bringing in business and some of the simpler implementations (most implementations are done by the company itself, as this is a crucial part of its competitive advantage). From the CEO interview on Capital Market Laboratories:Important new partners in the quarter were Zoom and Microsoft (MSFT). On the latter (Q2CC):And there are additional benefits from such an extensive ecosystem of partners (Q2CC):A major way of extending the platform is to add functionality and capabilities, for instance (Q2CC):The company is also leveraging the 5 billion minutes of customer interaction it processes yearly through its platform with the help of machine learning and condense that into a product: Agent Assist.This AI-based product produces real-time recommendations and predictions for the agent, and trials are already ongoing with four of its largest customers. Management expects Agent Assist to be included in upcoming versions of the platform in 2020.Adding features and products produces up-sell opportunities, and this is illustrated by the company's 107% dollar-based net retention rate.Q2 results were considerably better than expected:For this quarter, the company forecast revenue in a range of $78-79 million, and 14-15 cents EPS, topping the average estimate for $76 million and 14 cents. For the full year, the company projects $312.5-314.5 million and 70-73 cents per share, again above the average estimate of $306 million and 64 cents.Management also bolstered its longer-term outlook, arguing that the company could maintain its 30%+ growth rate for enterprise for years to come as contact centers are becoming of strategic importance all over the world.The 65% gross margin was a whisker from the company's record, despite Q2 usually being the softest quarter. Management argues the rise is simply due to the scaling of its subscription business (which is 92% of revenue, so hardly a surprise).Both gross margin as well as operating margin (and EBITDA margin) have improved steadily over time. From the earnings deck:It's quite remarkable that the company keeps on expanding its gross margin, as lower-margin service revenue is creeping up - from 3% at IPO to 7% in Q2 - as a result of more complex implementations at bigger clients.And basically, this is the long-term operating model where the company is heading, according to management (earnings deck):As the company achieved its financial targets a year early last year, it has stepped up investment in R&D. However, investors should note that (Q2CC):Given the EBITDA margin expectation, it looks like the company can clearly afford to invest in its future (even if Q4 is the seasonal high quarter), a picture which is confirmed by cash flows.Data by YChartsWe always like to see these growth stocks producing cash, and Five9 fits this bill for some time already. This opens up the path for acquisitions and buybacks, leveraging growth.The difference between operational and free cash flow is CapEx, which is guided to run between $20 million and $24 million this year.Share-based compensation stands at 12% of revenue, which is fairly substantial and has been responsible for a considerable amount of dilution:Data by YChartsThe company had $307.5 million in cash and equivalents and $203.1 million in debt at the end of Q2.Data by YChartsTen times sales is pretty substantial, but this is a company that is already delivering cash and positive earnings, with revenues growing at 25%+ and gross margins at 65%.Five9 is the market leader in a market that has a large runway in front of it. This picture is unlikely to change anytime soon, and given the revenue growth, gross margin expansion and operational leverage, we think the shares, whilst not cheap, are nevertheless attractive here.The company is already producing considerable amounts of cash flow, and the share price gains after the stellar Q2 figures have evaporated in the market correction in growth stocks."

Right now, I think the stock currently prices in a very strong 2019 performance as valuation has expanded a bit too much for my liking. However, over the long term, FIVN is an absolute winner as the contact center transforms into a more digitally-enabled industry.FIVN competes in the cloud software contact center market, focusing mostly on large enterprises. This market, known as the Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, is an estimated $24 billion industry which remains highly underpenetrated.

For example, when you call a contact center and receive an automated voice service, FIVN or another CCaaS player is behind this. This industry is poised to significantly grow over time as the legacy contact center market remains highly underpenetrated. FIVN estimates only 15% of the market uses cloud-based solutions, whereas 100% of FIVN's solutions are cloud-based. As this market continues to grow into the $24 billion TAM, FIVN will be a clear beneficiary.FIVN reported a strong Q4 earnings led by revenue growth of 31% to $72.3 million, which beat management's guidance of $65.8-66.8 million and consensus expectations of $66.5 million. FIVN also posted another quarter of massive EBITDA margin expansion, with margins of 22.7% compared to 12.4% in the year-ago period. Recurring revenue continues to drive the business, remaining at 93% of total revenue and strength in enterprise customers remains healthy, with 2018 revenue growing 29%.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, FIVN reached record high gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margins. Gross margins were 65.1%, expanding from 63.6% in the same period last year. This led to a record high gross profit of $47.1 million. In addition, adjusted EBITDA reached $16.4 million, representing a record 22.7% margin, significantly improving from 12.4% last year and well above the previous record 19.6% posted last quarter.Source: Company PresentationBoth of these margins remain on track to meet management’s previously stated immediate-term and long-term model. In the immediate term, management sees gross margins of 70%+, which is better than its previous 65-70% gross margin target. The current trend confirms FIVN continues to make progress towards this goal which seems very achieving in the medium term. Adjusted EBITDA margins are on a similar path, approaching management’s 27%+ long-term model guidance.Source: Company PresentationFor Q1, management guided revenue to $70-71 million and EPS of $0.11-0.13. For the full year, management guided revenue to $298.5-301.5 million and EPS of $0.58-0.62. Despite management's guidance being ahead of consensus expectations for $296 million of revenue and $0.58 in EPS, I believe the initial guidance sets FIVN up well for a beat and raise year.FIVN has rebounded nicely over the past few months coming off its post-correction low. Current valuation is ~10x forward revenue, pretty much the highest valuation the company has seen. Although the valuation is warranted at this time, given consistently strong revenue growth and expanding gross and EBITDA margins, it is challenging to believe there is much room left for any multiple expansion. The stock will likely earn a return throughout the year if the company can continue on its beat-and-raise pattern, thus providing a higher revenue base for the same multiple level. Additional upside could come if the company is able to achieve greater-than-expected profitability and expand gross and EBITDA margins faster than expected.FIVN is the largest pure-play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), RingCentral (NYSE:RNG), 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT), Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) and Vonage (VG). TWLO and RNG only provide software-based communication solutions whereas legacy players such as VG have hardware operations still intact.Data by YChartsAt the beginning of 2018, FIVN's multiple was the highest out of all the software communication players. After the late 2018 pullback, again FIVN's multiple was near the high end of its competitive cloud-based communications field. As of lately, the multiple has approached 10x forward revenue, which seems about right considering the company is performing well on all cylinders.For now, I do not see the multiple expanding much from here. If the multiple gets closer to 11x I would be a seller at those levels. As long as the multiple stays around 10x for now, I would hold onto any positions in the name. If FIVN continues its historical beat-and-raise pattern, the higher growth rate and revenue base combined with the same 10x forward revenue valuation will ultimately help make the stock work.I would be cautious to add to any positions at this level given the heightened valuation pricing in a very successful 2019. Even if the company exceeds all of its growth projections, this could already be priced into the stock.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited."

The strong revenue beat was led by strength within the company's enterprise customers, which represents ~80% of revenue and continues to outpace the overall company's growth.

This expansion in EBITDA margin was partially attributed to strength in gross margin, which expanded to 65% during the quarter.Source: Company PresentationBoth of these margins during the quarter remain on track to meet management's long-term model, which includes gross margin reaching 70%+ and adjusted EBITDA reaching 27%+, led by a slowdown in operating expenses such as R&D and G&A due to economies of scale. The better-than-expected revenue during the quarter help lead to an EPS of $0.20, which beat expectations for $0.12.Source: Company PresentationFor Q3, management expects revenue to be $78-79 million which was nicely above consensus expectations for ~$76 million. In addition, EPS for the quarter is expected to be $0.14-0.15, though we could see upside from here based on a combination of better-than-expected revenue and margins.For the full year, revenue is now expected to be $312.5-314.5 million (up from $304-307 million), which was ahead of consensus expectations for ~$306 million. Even with the strength in revenue growth for the first half of the year, management's guidance could be somewhat conservative, given the implied deceleration in revenue during the second half of the year. EPS for the year is now expected to be $0.70-0.73 (up from $0.61-0.66) and ahead of consensus expectations for $0.64. Even with the big raise, I believe guidance could still be achieved and raised during the next quarter, given the underpenetrated market potential and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding nicely.With the recent strength in the stock post-earnings, up nearly 20%, valuation continues to be on the rise. I agree the company should continue to be valued at a premium over the long term due to the large market potential and global TAM. With revenue growing nearly 30% and adjusted EBITDA margins continuing to expand, there are many metrics of the company investors like. The high recurring revenue structure gives investors greater confidence in the revenue stream, which naturally leads to a higher valuation.FIVN is the largest pure-play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG), 8x8 (EGHT), Bandwidth (BAND), and Vonage (VG).Data by YChartsWhile TWLO continues to have the highest multiple of these software communication providers, their revenue stream just reached the $1 billion run-rate market and is growing well above 50%. However, FIVN's valuation has approached 10x in the past, which seems reasonable, given the strength in revenue is greater and significant opportunity to keep growing over 15% for many years to come.Management's recently raised guidance could imply a little bit of conservatism, given the deceleration expected in the second half of the year. Over time, FIVN has done a great job beating expectations and surprising investors to the upside. Management's long-term model demonstrates the company's targets of significant margin expansion over time, and coupled with strong revenue growth, the company is poised to continue on their upward trend.Though not tempting to add more to a position after a 25% pop in stock price, investors should optimistically add to their position whenever the stock goes through a period of weakness. Given the historical beat and raise pattern, we could see the stock continue to beat expectations over the next few quarter, which could lead to further outperformance.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited."

From the earnings deck:Management was also rather upbeat about its competitive position (Q1CC):And it is cementing that as we speak through a variety of actions like:The company is particularly strong in the enterprise segment where it is raking in new logos. Its main ""competitor"" there is actually on-premise legacy systems, but more and more companies are starting to see the benefits of moving to the cloud.But as management argues, this movement is only in the very first innings, so there is plenty of runway left for the company (Q1CC):The growth in corporate customers is particularly important as these are likely to be sticky and have more opportunities for up-selling. Management is (at least for now) focusing most of its efforts on this segment and in Q1 it produced another good quarter with respect to this (Q1CC):And it's indeed the case that these big customers are more likely to buy more services as the 4 point sequential jump in the dollar net retention rate to 107% was ascribed to the shift towards bigger customers (and they ""couldn't exclude"" another rise in the dollar net retention rate). When asked what was driving the progress with enterprise, here is what management responded (Q1CC):From the earnings deck:Deep integration with CRM solutions like those of Salesforce (CRM) play an important role, and this is exactly what the company is offering. In fact, it continues to deepen this integration through R&D efforts. In its spring release (Q1CC):But it's not just integration with Salesforce, it's also other CRM companies and other solutions providers like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), CSI and a host of others. For the lower end of the market (below 50 seats), it also has integration with UC (unified communications) providers like Fuze.There are other benefits the company provides that are important (although not especially for big customers only), like automatic compliance and the suite of analytics.Then there is the shift to AI, which management argues it is especially well positioned for that given its enormous trove of recorded interactions with clients from all kinds of specific verticals.That is the ""raw data material"" which drives machine-learning which can result in useful AI solutions for clients. The company has a product roadmap which it has shared with its largest customers and it seems to share some of this as it revealed focusing on two particular solutions in the near future:The next phase is customer trials and all 15 customers the company asked wanted to participate. It also demonstrated some AI capabilities in public (Q1CC):Some analysts were worried that it would be hard to find people with AI skills or that the investments could be very costly, but that turns out not to be the case (Q1CC):Its ecosystem helps growth substantially (55%+ of new customers are brought in by partners), but also cements its solution:And while the company used to do all the service work for customers, it is starting to use some of the big system integrators now for that work as it is often part of a wider cloud transformation of clients.These big system integrators assisting clients with their digital transformations also take Five9 overseas, and while there is lots of room left to grow in the US, abroad is another big opportunity.The company has been doing really well; that's no secret (from earnings deck):The Q1 results were no exception, with revenues growing at 26.5% to $74.5M, beating expectations by $3.7M, and non-GAAP EPS beating by 4 cents to $0.16. Recurring revenue is 93% of the revenue with the rest made up of professional services.Guidance was increased after the Q1 figures. From the earnings PR:The company does have a long-term model:These keep improving. From the earnings deck:Gross margins improved 120bps from last year to land at 63.4%. The company is going to increase investments though (Q1CC):So there might not be a whole lot of operational leverage this year, and it looks like the company is using leverage to increase its investments in its business. As long as it has plenty of growth opportunities and is not bleeding cash (which it isn't), that seems a smart strategy to us:Data by YChartsAdjusted EBITDA margin will also dip during the year, but will come back above 20% in Q4.Data by YChartsCash flows have turned distinctly positive, which is always good to see certainly at this still fairly early stage in the company's development. It's helped by stock-based compensation, which at $8.68M in Q1 wasn't excessive.There has been considerable dilution, and the company also has $200M in debt outstanding:Data by YChartsAnd there are at least another 5M shares coming from incentives.Data by YChartsThe sales multiple has moved up quite a bit, and while this is backwards looking excluding another 25% growth this year, it also excludes nearly 10% of the fully diluted shares so a forward multiple would not be all that much lower.Non-GAAP EPS expectations are for $0.64 this year rising to $0.83 in 2020, so on an earnings basis, the shares are still rather expensive.There is little doubt the company is solidifying its position in what is likely to be a growth market that has much further to go, with many companies still on legacy systems that simply can't compete anymore, more especially because it's difficult to leverage the data (for stuff like AI).While the shares have been trading sideways this year, we don't see much room for further valuation multiple expansion (unless general market sentiment improves) and the company has a couple of fairly lean quarters in front of it.Longer term, we're considerably more positive and things could start to build in expectation for a good fourth quarter, so one could pick up a few shares on drops, but we wouldn't go all in just yet. On the other hand, they don't seem likely to drop significantly below $50 either unless we have a general market turmoil."

(FIVN), a leader in cloud contact center software, is one of many stocks that I consider to be leading the charge in digital transformation. Other transformation-enabling stocks, such as ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Atlassian (TEAM), are pushing all-time highs and, based on the stock chart, sales growth and growing free cash flow margin, I believe that Five9 is about to follow suit. We are in the heyday of digital transformation stocks!Five9 is a leader in cloud contact center software, with more than 17 years cloud contact center experience, 2000 customers worldwide and 3 billion customer interactions annually. The Five9 platform handles multiple channels of customer engagement, not only voice but also chat, email and social engagement. Five9 has an extensive ecosystem of partners, including leading customer relationship management (CRM), workforce management, performance management solutions and telephony providers.(Source: Q4 2018 Investor Presentation)Five9 operates what is known as Contact Center-as-a-Service (CCaaS), and believes there is a $24 billion Total Addressable Market (TAM) based on legacy systems, of which only 10-15% have been converted to the cloud. Opportunities for revenue growth are substantial, not only for landing new customers but expansion with existing customers.(Source: Q4 2018 Investor Presentation)With the hiring of the new CTO Jonathan Rosenberg in January, Five9 plans on becoming a leader in the field of AI for the contact center:Note: Five9 has already demonstrated a three-way integration that enables agents using Salesforce.com (CRM) to see suggested knowledge-based articles in real time based on a customer's speech during a call.High-growth companies generally don’t measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts. Therefore, I generally throw out traditional value factors and focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow and how the company performs relative to analyst estimates. But first, I would like to address the claim that Five9’s valuation is too high based on forward revenue (~10x). Using historical revenues (as opposed to forward), the Price/Sales Ratio is approximately 11.55. This is actually quite a reasonable figure for a growth stock which is growing revenues at a pace of 25+% per year.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Not only is Five9 growing at a rate of 25% per year, but it is also doing so without missing a step, as shown below.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Sales and General Administration (S&GA) expense relative to sales has been dropping steadily and is now below 56%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Five9's operating margin had been negative since it went public, but recently turned positive. The company is on the verge of turning the corner on profitability.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Free cash flow margin as a percentage of revenues is positive and rising, another great sign that the company is thriving.(Source: Portfolio123.com)I examine how a company performs versus analyst estimates, as it gives me a feel for how conservative company management is and how well they communicate with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Five9 has the best record of analyst estimates beats that I have ever seen. The company has exceeded estimates for the last 5 quarters for both sales and EPS. In fact, it not only exceeded, but trounced estimates.(Source: Portfolio123.com)After achieving all-time highs back in February, Five9 stock price pulled back. Four months later, it is nearing the February high, which now serves as a resistance level. Breaching this level ($55) will be a very bullish signal. On the other hand, if the stock price falls below the lower trend line (~$48), then this should be taken as a bearish signal.(Source: Finviz.com)Given that many digital transformation stocks are “on fire,” I expect that the stock price of Five9 will soon push higher. I am therefore bullish.Investing in Five9 has several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future. In addition, I have already indicated that cloud stocks are on a tear, and some people believe that we are in for a second “dot com” crash due to lofty valuation levels. There is also the possibility of losing market share to competitors such as AWS Connect, the Amazon.com (AMZN) contact center offering.In terms of company-related risks, I believe the main factor will be 2nd and 3rd quarter performance, as stated by company management:Five9 is one of several companies leading the charge in digital transformation. Company fundamentals are improving, S&GA is declining and long-term growth is greater than 25%. The company is making an investment in artificial intelligence that is expected to be a revenue driver in future. The stock price appears to be getting ready for a breakout, and in this article I propose going long the stock. The trade should be closed if the price drops below $48. As with any investment, there are risks associated with this trade, including a “dot com” crash, increased competition and possible lame company performance over the next 2 quarters.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

The company had a very good fourth quarter, exceeding expectations by quite a bit.Revenue was nearly 9% higher than expectations and Q4 Non-GAAP EPS ($0.23) beat expectations by $0.09. Here is the longer-term perspective:Data by YChartsOr, from the earnings deck:You see that the company has been doing well. It guides revenue growth at 16% every year and every year it way exceeds that growth:Data by YChartsIn 2018, growth is accelerating, recurring revenues are 93% of overall revenues, and the business model has a lot of leverage as well. The company enjoyed its first GAAP profitable quarter in its history. It's no wonder the share price has been doing well:Can the growth continue, we think it will and there are quite a few drivers:While contact centers are a mature market, cloud contact centers are relatively new (Q4CC):The company is more focused on the enterprise segment, in which it is very successful as they hired sales people with experience selling to enterprise ahead of the curve, as management discussed (Q4CC):The company has a large ecosystem and a host of partners, which influenced over 55% of the deals closed in Q4. The deals are getting ever larger and companies are adding seats as well as product, resulting in a dollar net retention rate of 103%, up from 101% in Q3.Their mid-market segment, customers with 50-500 seats, is also growing nicely albeit at a considerably slower pace, even if it accelerated to above 10% growth in Q4.This is yet another market the company could tap for additional growth; it's just 23% of their business today. International sales, which make up less than 10% of the company's revenues, is another potential growth area. Here too, there are lots of gains to be made still and growth is accelerating.It's competitive position seems to be very good as it's again one of few leaders in Gartner's Quadrant for Contact Centers as a Service,The company has been adding product steadily, a cloud platform makes that easier. The company website provides a nice overview. It's one of the reasons why the dollar net expansion rate moved up a notch this quarter (from 101% to 103% sequentially). And they have been pretty aggressive (Q4CC):AI is of course driven by big data, and it's here where the cloud offers advantages, from Q4CC:At present, converting that speech to text, necessary to serve as input for machine learning, is still expensive (roughly $0.01 per minute), although open source solutions are already at the level of computing required (but management is still evaluating solutions here).While the technology is already good enough, the rise of conversational interfaces on computers will drive the cost down further to near zero, which is when the company could start monetizing its data trove.Management argues that there will be little immediate revenue from AI; this is something a little further out even though they are assembling an impressive team of experts as it is clearly a direction the market is taking. The most immediate prospects where AI could be put to work are:From the Q4CC:The company experiences some seasonality with revenue growth most pronounced in the second half of the year, particularly Q4, so it's not surprising that they guide the upcoming Q1 as basically flat sequentially with non-GAAP EPS at $0.11-$0.13.Data by YChartsThe company achieved its intermediate margin targets one year ahead of time:OpEx grew only 10% in 2018 showing increasing leverage in the business model, and there are lots of ways to enhance margins further:At present, all the applications are hosted on the company's own servers but here is what management noted (Q4CC):Management seems to be considering moving to the public cloud, which would save them a ton of CapEx and hassle, but the requirements are rather strict (Q4CC):Data by YChartsCash flow has been steadily increasing; this is a pretty impressive graph (Q4CC):They also have a healthy balance sheet:Data by YChartsNot surprisingly, the market has been recognizing what has been going on with the company. The company has a 2019 sales multiple of 10, which is pretty steep. From SA:Analyst estimate 2019 (non-GAAP) EPS at $0.66 and 2020 EPS at $0.81, needless to say the stock is also rather expensive on an earnings basis. Things are going really well for the company and it seems to have multiple levers to keep the good times rolling.We do believe the shares are fairly fully valued at the moment and see little room for multiple expansion so you'd be buying the growth of the company and the operational leverage, with the risk of a disappointing quarter. That is still nothing to sniff about, especially as management has a habit of being very conservative with its guidance. For those for whom the valuation is still a major hurdle, consider writing puts or waiting for a pullback."
4316301,35181,2020-01-11T08:08:08-05:00,"This company is the poster child for digital transformation, leading the way with strong 28% revenue growth and a great free cash flow margin.Stock is at all-time highs amidst its latest breakout.Large barely tapped TAM.While somewhat overvalued, it is still a good time to be bullish on Five9, very bullish in fact.As with any investment, there are significant risks here.","Five9, Inc. (FIVN), a leader in cloud contact center software, is at the heartland of the digital transformation revolution. Other transformation-enabling stocks, such as ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce.com (CRM), are pushing all-time highs and Five9 is following suit after breaking out from the previous high set in November.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I learned a long time ago that when the market speaks, you listen or risk getting left behind. Despite the fact that Five9 is overvalued, at least by my relative valuation method, the stock is moving. So don't blink, don't hesitate; it is time to jump on the bandwagon.Five9 has great sales growth of approximately 28% YoY, a strong free cash flow margin of 11%, and has blown by analysts' estimates for the last five quarters. For these reasons, I am changing my rating from Bullish to Very Bullish. My previous article on Five9 can be found here.As I have explained in a recent article, high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin, and the software company ""Rule of 40%"".Five9 had an excellent year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 29%, slightly higher than its 5-year annual growth rate of 25%.(Source: Portfolio123)Five9’s free cash flow margin TTM has been steadily rising and positive since the mid-2016 and is currently sitting at a very healthy 11% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40%. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Five9’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 28% + 11% = 39%The calculation comes out close enough to 40% that I am going to consider this a passing grade. I would like to note that Five9 takes the Rule of 40% seriously, but uses EBITDA margin instead of free cash flow margin, giving the company a passing grade with lots of margin (pun intended).(Source: Five9 2019 Q3 earnings presentation slides)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"", also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Five9 is substantially above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Five9 is valued much higher than the average stock in my digital transformation universe.However, a similar evaluation based on next year's earnings estimate/EV suggests that the company is much closer to being fairly valued.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Considering the two evaluations, I believe that Five9 is overvalued based on its EV/forward sales multiple, but I would temper that assessment somewhat based on the company's earnings estimate for next year.One of the reasons that I like Five9 so much is the company's track record since going public. Unlike other companies that have gone crazy with spending, Five9 has done well for shareholders, with significantly improved gross margin, operating expenses and EBITDA margin.(Source: Five9 2019 Q3 earnings presentation slides)Another area that I monitor and use to judge company management is in the area of revenue and earnings beats. When company management gives out conservative guidance, the company generally beats analysts' estimates. Five9 has a stellar record in this area.(Source: Portfolio123)I believe that now is the time to initiate a position in Five9, but such an investment comes with significant risks.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. I would not dismiss the possibility of a dot-com-like crash in the future.There are other uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and President Trump's impeachment, which could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.Five9 is starting to target large enterprises for future growth. It is possible that this market segment does not pan out or grow as fast as management anticipates.Five9 is also starting to sell into international markets. Europe and Asia have their own set of risks that could prove to be a setback for Five9.Five9, with its contact center offerings, is at the heart of the digital transformation revolution. This company, along with other major players in digital transformation, is experiencing new all-time highs. Five9 is starting the new year off with a bang, with a price breakout from the high set back in November.The stock movement is supported by strong company fundamentals, including 28% revenue growth and an 11% free cash flow margin. The company handily exceeds the Rule of 40% when calculated using the EBITDA margin.While the stock price is valued somewhat higher than other stocks in my digital transformation stock universe, the high valuation is tempered by estimates of next year's earnings. I don't believe that investors should hold back based on a higher market valuation. The stock is moving now and I suggest that investors embrace this. I am adjusting my rating for Five9 from Bullish to Very Bullish."

As the traditional contact center market moves away from investments in personnel and more towards software, FIVN is the only pure-play in this market. The stock is still ~15% below their early September highs, and a recent strong Q3 earnings report provides a great opportunity for long-term investors to build a position in this leading software communication name.FIVN reported a strong Q3 earnings in early November and reinforced their leadership position in the enterprise contact center market, with revenue growing 30% and EBITDA margins expanding 930 bps to 19.6%, a record high for the company. The enterprise contact center market remains very underpenetrated, with FIVN estimating only 10-15% of the market using cloud-based solutions (Source: Company Presentation).FIVN data by YChartsThe recent ~15% pullback in the stock price is similar to the pullback seen in other leading communication names, such as Twilio (TWLO), RingCentral (RNG) and 8x8 (EGHT). The chart below demonstrates FIVN's peer group performance over the past three months, with TWLO and Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) being the only two names posting positive returns. This group was hit especially hard over the past month; however, strong earnings reports from each company has reinforced their long-term viability and strength.FIVN competes in the cloud software contact center market, focusing mostly on large enterprises. This market, known as the Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, is an estimated $24 billion industry which remains highly underpenetrated. According to FIVN, the CCaaS industry has a global TAM of ~$24 billion, with ~6.4 million agents in North America and ~9.4 million internationally (Source: Company Presentation).Source: Company PresentationLegacy communication vendors have historically focused on building on large contact centers, otherwise known as call centers. This market historically has invested largely in people to work the phones and provide customer service. I am sure many readers have an experience calling customer service and speaking with agents in the contact center. Not all of these experiences is necessarily negative; however, the use of technology has advanced the customer service experience.Another factor of legacy contact center operations is their use of offshore or nearshore operations. Largely held in India and Philippines, these contact centers play host to hundreds or even thousands of workers. While this offshore work is generally cheaper for the company compared to domestic employees, technology has changed the way contact centers operate.The CCaaS market, led by FIVN, continues to advance the contact center market by providing software communication services. For example, when you call a contact center and receive an automated voice service, FIVN or another CCaaS player is behind this. This industry is poised to significantly grow over time as the legacy contact center market remains highly underpenetrated. FIVN estimates only 15% of the market uses cloud-based solutions, whereas 100% of FIVN's solutions are cloud-based. As this market continues to grow into the $24 billion TAM, FIVN will be a clear beneficiary.FIVN reported a strong Q3 earnings in early November, which caused the stock to go up ~15%. This strength was led by revenue growing 30% to $65.3 million, which beat management’s guidance of $61.0-62.0 million. FIV also posted record high gross and adjusted EBITDA margins, which both remain on track to exceed their immediate term targets and on pace to achieve the longer term model. Recurring revenue continues to drive the business, remaining at 93% of total revenue and strength in enterprise customers remains healthy, with LTM enterprise revenue growing 37%, now accounting for 75%+ of revenue.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, FIVN reached record high gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margins. Gross margins were 64.3%, expanding from 63.1% in the same period last year. This led to a record high gross profit of $42.0 million. In addition, adjusted EBITDA reached $12.8 million, representing a record 19.6% margin, significantly improving from 10.3% last year and well above the previous record 15.8% posted last quarter.Both of these margins remain on track to meet management’s previously stated immediate-term and long-term model. In the immediate term, management sees gross margins in the range of 65-70%, which FIVN could potentially reach next quarter at this rate. Over the long term, they see gross margins expanding above 70%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are on a similar path, approaching management’s 22%+ immediate-term model and on track to expand to reach management’s 27%+ long-term model guidance.With FIVN still trading ~15% below their September highs and operations remaining stronger than ever, this stock seems prime to return to their upward stock trend. FIVN is the largest pure play competitor in the CCaaS market and continues to be valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio, RingCentral, 8x8, Bandwidth and Vonage (VG). TWLO and RNG only provide software-based communication solutions whereas legacy players such as VG have hardware operations still intact.FIVN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith FIVN's revenue growing ~30% a year and margins (gross, operating, and adjusted EBITDA) continuing to improve, FIVN is deserving of a forward revenue multiple closer to the top end of the group.At the beginning of 2018, FIVN's multiple was the highest out of all the software communication players. However, the recent pullback has led to FIVN's multiple contract noticeably lower than both TWLO and RNG. The similar multiple to RNG and ~3x turn to TWLO difference should excite investors about this opportunity to build a position in FIVN.For comparison, TWLO is forecasted to grow revenue by ~50% this year with gross margins in the mid-50s, and RNG is forecasted to grow revenue in the mid-20s with gross margins ~80%.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited.The ~15% pullback in FIVN's stock over the past month or so provides investors with a great opportunity to build a position. The strong Q3 earnings release demonstrated FIVN's leadership in the CCaaS market, especially within the enterprise segment, which grew almost 40% LTM. The company remains on track to achieve/exceed both their immediate-term and long-term operating models. At these levels, FIVN trades at a noticeable discount to other software communication players such as TWLO and RNG and investors should take advantage of this opportunity."

While this offshore work is generally cheaper for the company compared to domestic employees, technology has changed the way contact centers operate.The CCaaS market, led by FIVN, continues to advance the contact center market by providing software communication services. For example, when you call a contact center and receive an automated voice service, FIVN or another CCaaS player is behind this. This industry is poised to significantly grow over time as the legacy contact center market remains highly underpenetrated. FIVN estimates only 15% of the market uses cloud-based solutions, whereas 100% of FIVN's solutions are cloud-based. As this market continues to grow into the $24 billion TAM, FIVN will be a clear beneficiary.FIVN reported a solid Q2 earnings in early August, which caused the stock to go up ~25% the following day to over $43 a share. This strength was led by revenue growing 28% to $61.1 million, which beat consensus of $56.5 million and management's guidance of $55.8-56.8 million. The large beat was attributed to strength in recurring revenue, which reached 93%, and enterprise revenue growing 37%, now accounting for ~75% of revenue.FIVN's commercial business accelerated growth, reaching 10% growth and represents the remaining ~25% of revenue. In addition, gross margin of ~64% was up 150 bps y/y leading to operating income of $7.1 million, which was ahead of consensus estimates for $4.3 million.Source: Company PresentationEPS of $0.11 beat consensus estimates for $0.04 and management's guidance of $0.03-0.04. The strength of revenue growth and margin expansion led to management increasing their guidance by $0.13 for the full year. With Q2 EPS beating guidance by ~$0.07, the $0.06 delta in EPS raise demonstrates management's confidence in the underlying business and their ability to generate earnings.Source: Company PresentationAdjusted EBITDA margin reached 15.4% on the quarter, a 920 bps expansion y/y. Overall, FIVN's Q2 performance clearly demonstrates they are on the path to management's long-term model.Gross margins have expanded significantly since 2014, from 53% to 64% this past quarter, on pace to reach management's 70%+ long-term model. Adjusted EBITDA margins have improved even more. In 2014, adjusted EBITDA margins were (22%), which compares to the Q2 margin of ~16%.The ~15% pullback in FIVN's stock has been larger in magnitude than the other communication players. Though FIVN is the largest pure play competitor in the CCaaS market, they are valued on similar metrics as leading software communication companies such as Twilio, RingCentral, 8x8 and Vonage (VG). TWLO and RNG only provide software-based communication solutions whereas legacy players such as VG have hardware operations still intact.FIVN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith FIVN's revenue growing just south of 30% a year and margins (gross, operating, and adjusted EBITDA) continuing to improve, FIVN is deserving of a forward revenue multiple close to market leaders TWLO and RNG.At the beginning of 2018, FIVN's multiple was the highest out of all the software communication players. However, the recent pullback has led to FIVN's multiple contract noticeably lower than both TWLO and RNG. The ~1x turn to RNG and ~3x turn to TWLO difference should excite investors about this opportunity to build a position in FIVN.For comparison, TWLO is forecasted to grow revenue by ~50% this year with gross margins in the mid-50's, and RNG is forecasted to grow revenue in the mid-20s with gross margins ~80%.Risks to FIVN include increased competition from other software communication players. In addition, if the market takes longer to invest in cloud-based contact center solutions, FIVN's growth may be limited.The ~15% pullback in FIVN's stock over the past few weeks provides investors with a great opportunity to build a position. At this point, FIVN's stock is lower than the day after the Q2 earnings. The strong Q2 earnings release demonstrated FIVN's leadership in the CCaaS market, especially within the enterprise segment, which grew almost 40%. At these levels, FIVN trades at a noticeable discount to other software communication players such as TWLO and RNG and investors should take advantage of this opportunity."
4204316,104099,2018-09-05T15:39:42-04:00,"I think there's much to like about Five9 Inc. if the company can continue to grow at current rates.That said, investors are being asked to pay a huge premium, and much of the good news is already priced in, putting new shareholders on the horns of a dilemma.I offer an option that gives new investors most of the taste of returns at far fewer calories of risk.","Over the past year, the shares of Five9 Inc. (FIVN) are up about 125% on the back of a craze for all things “cloud.” In my view, at this point, investors would be wise to take profits in the shares. With the gains, I think investors should consider the seemingly radical idea of buying into a business that actually makes money, ideally one that pays out some of that money in the form of a dividend. Less ideal, but far less risky a proposition in my view, is the strategy of switching to call options at this point. I think speculators... sorry… ""investors"" in this business would be much better off buying call options rather than holding shares at these levels. I’ll go through my reasoning below.Five9 Inc. is a provider of cloud software for contact centers. This is an important niche, given the importance of contact centers in delivering customer service and marketing services. The company focuses exclusively on delivering cloud services, and I think there are three structural pluses here. They are:In short, I think the company serves a very significant need in a market that is just barely penetrated at the moment.A quick review of the financial history here seems to confirm the growing popularity of these services. Over the past five years, the company has grown sales at a CAGR of about 19%, and have reduced the loss per share at a CAGR of about 118%. The ongoing popularity of the solutions is obvious also comparing this year to last. Revenue is up nicely, and the net loss has dropped dramatically. The problem, and this relates to the financial treadmill that companies like this are on, is the fact that expenses grow quickly too. For instance, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are up at a CAGR of 9%, 19%, and 11%, respectively. This gets to the heart of it in my view. A company grows quickly by attracting customers with its new and innovative products. In order to continue to grow quickly, though, it must continue to invest and grow expenses. This calls into question exactly how scaleable a business like this one is.Additionally, the company has been funding its ongoing losses via share sales. Dilution here is quite severe, with shares outstanding having grown at a CAGR of about 67%. This dilution is obviously a challenge for investors today who will be getting smaller and smaller slices of the hopefully profitable future business.One group that has been treated well is employees, with per employee share-based compensation up at a CAGR of about 13.5% over the past four years.Source: Company filingsOne of the more difficult elements of investing in my view relates to the fact that not only must we find a decent, profitable business, but we must buy it at a reasonable valuation. Buying a profitable business at an excessive price is just as bad as buying an unprofitable business at a cheap price, in my view. For that reason, I need to spend some time talking about the stock as distinct from the business.I use a few tools to work out whether a stock is inexpensive relative to its future cash flows, one of which I talk about briefly. The simplest of my approaches is in many ways the most elegant in my view. It describes how much an investor is paying today for a stream of future free cash. In my view, even a cursory glance at the price to free cash flow of this stock at the moment leads to the inevitable conclusion that this stock is expensive. A picture is worth more than a thousand words:Source: GurufocusAlthough the shares are less expensive on a price to free cash flow basis than they have been for most of their history, they are still expensive relative to the overall market. Given that investing is a relativistic game, and that investors can access any of thousands of stocks, this doesn’t bode well for shareholders in my view.In order to be as fair as possible to the long side here, I should point out that one of my investing heroes, Joel Greenblatt, has just initiated a position in Five9. He bought 10,225 shares back in June, and is already up about 50% on the stock. I would also point out that Five9 has a relatively low “Greenblatt yield” of only ~14% (Greenblatt defines return on capital as EBIT divided by property plant and equipment plus net working capital). This suggests to me that Greenblatt is scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one and I wouldn’t be surprised if he sells out sooner, rather than later.In my view, there are better uses for capital elsewhere. I think investors generally do better when they pay a discount for a company’s future free cash flow. That said, I understand why an investor might want to buy this business, given the market it serves. Such people may believe that this company can dominate this juicy future market, free of competition. I think that’s unrealistic, but I can understand the view. For such people who remain committed to remaining long, I recommend call options. These give most of the upside from the stock at far less risk. By switching out of shares and into calls, investors can be “right”, whichever way the stock moves. If, as I suspect is inevitable here, the stock drops, call holders will lose less. If the manic crowd continues to bid these shares higher, call holders will benefit on a percentage basis at far less risk. Thus, I urge long stock holders to replace each lot of shares with the January call with a strike price of $50. At the time of writing, the bid-ask for this option is $3.40 to $4.20. Thus, for under 10% of the risk, an investor here has most of the upside over the next several months. For the uninitiated, these are American calls which allow you to sell them prior to expiration.I’ve made no secret of the fact that I think that as a group, tech investors are much more comfortable with risk than most. While they acknowledge that a company must ultimately make money for shareholders in order to be a rewarding investment, they are willing to buy shares of unprofitable businesses based on a hopeful narrative around some future state. They seem to discount the possibility of any other future state than the one that they have predicted. That strategy seems to have worked out for them with Five9 Inc., given the recent share price rise. Successful investing is about more than stock price gains, though. It also involves managing risk to the extent possible.To paraphrase a well known politician, “let me be clear”, I don’t believe the Five9 story will end well for investors who buy at these levels, and I think investors would be wise to take profits in the shares and buy a business that generates actual profit. That said, I understand that there are people on this platform with a greater appetite for speculation than me, and for those people I recommend replacing each “lot” (i.e., 100 shares) they own with a single January $50 call. With this strategy, the risk of share ownership is reduced massively, while the reward remains largely intact."
3852716,56112,2016-02-02T10:29:20-05:00,"Five9 has doubled since its Q3 earnings report.While the shift from on-prem to cloud in contact center software is very real, the competitive landscape is fairly intense and Interactive Intelligence appears to be starting a price war.Five9 does have long-term opportunity, but it's not cheap absolutely and quite expensive relatively. I don't think it deserves a premium valuation relative to peers.","Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) didn't get the memo that it's a tough market for small-caps. In fact, it's been on a tear since November, outperforming its peers by a wide margin:It's now trading at a valuation substantially above peers:While Five9's quarter was pretty good, I didn't think it was that good. With a valuation well above its publicly-traded peers - and fundamental prospects that don't appear to be substantially better - I think it would be prudent to use the run up to take some profits if you're in the name. If you're not, on the other hand, now is probably not the time to jump in.Competition: More Intense Than Some BelieveThe bull thesis for Five9 is pretty simple: there's a $22 billion recurring revenue opportunity in providing customer engagement software to call centers, and cloud penetration is currently only 10%. With on-premise solutions responsible for the remaining 90% market share, there's lots of blue sky, as legacy vendors wed to old technology platforms and constrained by fear of cannibalizing their lucrative on-prem business will fall like dominoes before the might of cloud-native Five9.It's a seductive story… and it even checks out at first. Major on-prem vendor Avaya - which is owned by TPG but provides investor materials anyway - is levered over 5x EBITDA (roughly) and has been demonstrably struggling over the past few years. LBO companies are not renowned for their focus on expensive technological innovation at the cost of periodic cash flow, and indeed, a variety of ""scuttlebutt"" sources (Glassdoor reviews, industry commentary, etc.) suggest that Avaya's investment in technology isn't where it needs to be.When you start to dig a little deeper, however, the rosy outlook starts to get a bit murkier. Avaya is merely one of several meaningful competitors - and some of the competitive field is doing quite well. Cloud revenues at Interactive Intelligence (NASDAQ:ININ) grew 77% to $25.9 million in the quarter, while inContact's (NASDAQ:SAAS) software revenues grew 40% y/y to $36.7 million (with positive EBITDA). These comparisons are not one-to-one for a variety of reasons, of course, but I think they're still instructive.With this context for Five9's $32.3 million in Q3 revenue - up 25% y/y - the run up in the stock becomes even more confusing. Unlike some vertical-SaaS plays such as Mindbody (NASDAQ:MB) or Cvent (NYSE:CVT) where it seems reasonable to believe that they have a pretty big lead on the competition, in the call-center space, it's not so clear. Of course, each company claims to be a leader - but from the outside it's hard to tell.A few other things are worth noting here. First, the call center market is very mature - while there's obviously a good growth story in terms of the on-prem to SaaS transition, the TAM is not going to expand much over time (so this is a market share battle). Second, data from Interactive Intelligence as well as Avaya suggests that new on-prem bookings continue to be fairly solid - there is an obvious shift to cloud underway, but it's not so rapid as to suggest that the legacy on-prem vendors are not still competitive threats over the medium term.Balance Sheet Adds To The ConcernsCompounding the competitive issues I discuss above, Five9 has a shorter balance sheet runway than most of the recently-IPOed SaaS companies I look at. While the company did have $59 million of cash and equivalents as of the end of last quarter, the company also has $37 million in total debt, for a net cash position in the neighborhood of $20 million (perhaps less depending on cash outflow in Q4). $20 million of this debt matures in 2016, with the rest maturing in 2017 and beyond.In terms of cash burn, the company used ~$3.5 million of cash in Q3 2015, and consumed $12MM of cash from operations in the nine months ended 9/30. At the current run-rate, the net cash on the balance sheet represents roughly six quarters' worth of burn (which, again, is much lower than most of the SaaS companies I look at). Obviously, gross cash available is much higher than that even in light of near-term maturities, so please don't misinterpret what I'm saying - I'm not trying to imply the company is at any sort of immediate risk here. I'm just pointing out that Five9 has its own balance sheet constraints in a way, though they're certainly nowhere as oppressive as Avaya's.In any event, the company has made significant strides towards profitability. As of the last conference call, management expressed that they expect to be at or close to break-even, on an EBITDA basis, by Q3 2016. If they achieve this goal, then they should get to sustained profitability on a free cash flow basis and still have net cash left over. That said, if for some reason their win rate falls - or if pricing becomes more of a factor in light of competition - then they might be inclined to slow down growth or raise additional equity capital, neither of which would be great for the valuation.To wit, on the pricing issue, one of my concerns here is this: competitor Interactive Intelligence has publicly expressed its willingness to undercut Five9 on price as it comes down from its traditional Enterprise focus to attack more of the SMB market. (This is essentially the opposite path from Five9's evolution.) Interactive Intelligence CEO Don Brown discussed this on the August call:Five9 would respond that their win rate continues to be high - and at north of 70% as of the last quarter, it is indeed just fine for now. However, Interactive's approach may require Five9 to take a slightly different approach on pricing going forward. Brown followed up on ININ's Q3 call with a tangible example:To the extent that Interactive Intelligence continues this strategy, mathematically speaking, Five9 will have to take a hit on either its win rate or its pricing. Interactive Intelligence also has a key asset that Five9 does not: a relatively large, quite profitable on-prem business that can subsidize continuing losses in cloud (and allow them to keep up a price war if they want to). They're not the only ones operating from a position of strength: inContact, as I referenced earlier, is profitable.In fact, inContact is very proud of the fact that Q3 was its 15th consecutive quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. So if Interactive keeps pushing aggressively on price, I would imagine that inContact has room to respond in kind if they choose to do so. Two competitors who are posting strong growth and have room to sacrifice margins hardly bodes well for Five9's simultaneous margin and growth ambitions.To be clear, I'm not suggesting that Five9 can't, or won't, succeed in the face of competition. All I'm saying is that growth and margin improvement here won't be like taking candy from a baby. Avaya may have issues of its own to deal with, but the rest of the industry seems to be pretty serious. With that, I think investors should be cautious about what growth rates and profitability expectations they model in here.Target Model: Is It Achievable?For just about every SaaS company, 20% EBITDA margins seems to be the generic target. I swear I get deja vu every time I look at a ""target model"" slide in a company's deck. In the case of Five9, what's interesting is exactly how they plan to get there. Here's the relevant slide from the company's investor deck:For now, let's run with the company's gross margin guidance (just for the sake of argument). One of my areas of chief concern is their expectation of substantial R&D leverage over time (circled in red above). Again looking at the peer group for context, you notice that Interactive has been holding R&D pretty steady in the high teens range, while inContact is actually ramping it up.It gets worse than the chart: since Interactive Intelligence has a much larger revenue base, their actual R&D spend (in dollars) is in the neighborhood of 3x of Five9's current expenditures.Given all of the competitive pressures I discussed, I'm not sure if trying to lower R&D as a percent of revenues is tenable - or, if it is tenable, if it's smart. Five9 would likely respond that Interactive's product is not as good, and that they have to support the on-prem business as well, and these could certainly be valid points - but Interactive's success in cloud, to date, suggests that they will at least be a decent competitor over time.To reiterate, I'm not saying that Five9 can't reach their target model - simply that it seems odd for the company to have such a premium valuation to peers in light of these factors.Wrapping It UpI don't have any particular beef with Five9 as a company. That said, my research leads me to believe that the competitive landscape is much more intense than some investors may believe. With that, it's not clear why the company deserves the sort of valuation premium it currently enjoys, and I'm worried about Interactive's pricing pressure starting to weigh on Five9's results - perhaps even as soon as this quarter.Five9 isn't cheap on an absolute basis and certainly looks expensive on a relative basis, so the value proposition here as a long doesn't appear to be compelling. In fact, investors more inclined to trading than I am might even consider it as the short leg of a pair trade. There is certainly opportunity here, as I believe that the shift from on-prem to SaaS will be very real - but I believe that Five9 won't be the only company to capture some of that share.As a final note: I worked on Interactive Intelligence and inContact at the same time (for obvious reasons) and write-ups will be forthcoming soon.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4200431,21815,2018-08-20T01:45:29-04:00,"The company produced Q2 figures which beat expectations and the shares jumped higher.Investors should be aware that the re-acceleration of growth might not last, at least not to the extent it did in Q2.While going all-in on quarterly results is always a little risky, we think that in the longer term, there are plenty of tailwinds for the company and the shares will go higher.","Not so long ago we wrote about leading cloud contact center provider Five9 (FIVN) and we argued that the correction at the end of June made the shares interesting.Well, indeed they turned out to be, but we could not have predicted that the company blew past expectations with its Q2 figures. So that correction is now already a distant memory as the shares have hit a new all-time high:And here you see the growth that the company is enjoying (from a recent presentation at Oppenheimer:And here from the Q2 10-Q:Its enterprise business re-accelerated to 37% growth (surprising as Q2 is usually seasonally weak) and even its smaller (and less profitable) commercial business grew double-digits, something which it hasn't been doing for quite some time. And we think the company has structural tailwinds, some of which we'll discuss below.The company has a large market in front of it because there is an ongoing shift to the cloud. The functionality of cloud-based systems like those of Five9 is now equal to those of legacy systems, and the speed of the movement is mostly influenced by the lifespan of the legacy systems (7-10 years) and infrastructure.Management argues that only 15% of companies have shifted to the cloud, so there is a large runway in front of them.And of course it's much easier to do stuff in the cloud like scale up and link to other applications, use AI, etc...It's the combined shift to the cloud + the advent of AI (see below) that is disrupting the contact center market and producing a considerable tailwind for the company.The company doesn't only expand by landing new customers, existing customers expand by adding seats and acquiring additional modules and functionality like:The company is continuously increasing functionality in the core contact center package and adding modules. For instance, in the latest (spring 2018) release the company added stuff like AI-driven workflow, Enhanced Analytics for Prescriptive Insight, and Open Platform.The company is building on the capabilities of a host of ecosystem partners in various ways:While indeed a majority of sales are initiated by partners, the company handles the execution of these themselves in its 'high-touch' approach to keep customers happy. This seems to work given the company's 99% dollar retention rate (up a point from Q1).Integration with CRM suites like those of Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft's dynamics CRM has been top priority as contact center applications like that of Five9 is a natural complement for CRM applications.The company has expanded its partnership with UC (unified communications) provider Fuze. There is obvious convergence between UC and contact center applications, but management argues that it doesn't compete as its contact center can be built on top of any legacy UC, not vice versa isn't possible.Cloud US is more of a commodity with a lower price point but there is a nice synergy in go-to-market structure that led to the partnership.The company announced a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and some analysts were worried that Google could move on its turf. The company is moving to the public cloud for two main reasons:The move is not motivated to reduce cost, although that could be a result. It's mainly motivated to empower its applications with the powerful AI stuff that only the big cloud players have, like (Q2CC):What kind of stuff does this enable, well here is an example. Five9 is gathering in the order of 15M voice recordings per day, and what Google's cheap ($0.05/m) speech to text AI app allows is (Q2CC):Why is Google not competing? Simple, it doesn't have the enterprise and domain specific data that Five9 has (Q2CC):It can use that data for the machine learning at Google to improve and widen the gap over the legacy applications which don't have much of a data repository (as these systems are still largely analog).So these solutions complement one another, Google can monetize its cloud and AI solutions which empower Five9 to improve its contact center apps. Expect a slow but sustained move to the public cloud.FIVN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThese are GAAP margins. Adjusted gross margin reached 63.8% in Q2, 150 basis points above a year ago and these have been increasing (y/y) for 22 consecutive quarters. With respect to operating cost (Q2CC):Its adjusted EBITDA margin has been rising (y/y) for 19 consecutive quarters and reached 15.8% in Q2. Its long-term adjusted EBITDA margin model is 27%+ (via 22%+ in H2 2019).FIVN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is already generating quite a bit of cash, so it was somewhat surprising that it issued convertible notes in May for the net proceeds (minus cost and paying off its revolver of $32.6M) of $186.8M.Management argues that this was simply to take advantage of the very low financing cost in an environment of raising rates. Well, in any case, the company has plenty of cash and it is saving roughly $2.5M in interest cost in 2018 to boot.The company now has $274.3M in cash and marketable securities, and $190M in notes outstanding.The free cash flow comes from share-based compensation, but this is nothing unusual for a company like this. There has been quite a bit of dilution, but that should decelerate considerably with the improved cash generation.FIVN Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsFor the full year 2018 (earnings PR):There is no hiding, the shares are pretty expensive:FIVN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect an EPS this year of $0.4 rising to $0.54 next year, needless to say the earnings multiple (which isn't terribly relevant at this stage, in our view) is tremendous.We give you our verdict:"
3975677,52382,2016-05-18T11:52:23-04:00,"FIVN has suffered along with other Cloud stories, but the dynamics for the Cloud-based contact center software space are holding up well.FIVN is well positioned in the space with improving topline and margins.Consistent performance and profitability should help re-rate the stock and invite acquisition premium.","Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), like the rest of the class of Cloud services names, has faced its own trial by fire, but during the ups or downs of the last two years, the market for Cloud-based contact centers has continued at a decent clip and now that the profitability is finally at hand, this might be a good time for investors to take a closer look.Image Source: Five9 presentationThe business was initially shrugged off as merely an incremental change over the premise-based contact center software industry, which is dominated by the large legacy vendors with pockets deep enough to ward off any competitive challenge, i.e. companies likes Avaya (with PE funds now) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) among others. On top of that, the business was making a loss and the competition in the Cloud-based contact center space also started to heat up, with investors adopting a wait and watch approach to finding final winners in the space. During the last year or so, most Cloud-based business models came under scrutiny, including Five9, partly due to the changing market conditions giving more credence to the profitability and long-term sustainability of the model rather than just the topline growth.On most of these counts, the business seems ready to come out in good condition. The performance across all key metrics has improved and exceeded expectations, be it revenue growth, quality of growth, profitability or cash flow, and the dynamics working for the story seem bigger than just a quarter or two of improved performance. The broader shift away from on-premise solutions offered by legacy vendors towards the Cloud-based solutions seem to have reached a critical mass and the penetration rates of the Cloud solutions is still low. In the meantime, Five9 is in a good position to monetize strong demand from the enterprise segment, as reflected in the high double-digit growth in enterprise subscription revenues. Be it the quality of revenue (e.g. the proportion of recurring revenue), the win rate and the average deal size, or the leading indicators (e.g. the increase in the sales capacity and new partnerships), the metrics support the continuation of the strong momentum. Financially, the high leverage in the model was never doubted, but now with steady revenue growth, consistent improvement in the gross margins, adjusted EBITDA break-even, industry leading incremental margins, the wait for achieving the long-term goal of 20% EBITDA margins might not be long and the growth curve from here onwards should be pretty sharp too. Looking at the current pace of improvement, as visible in the chart below, the company might be able to achieve these margins over the next 4-6 quarters.The environment for Cloud-based contact center software as strong as everAs I mentioned in an article on competitor inContact (NASDAQ:SAAS), the broader dynamics for the Cloud-based contact center software space continue to be strong. The recent performance of Interactive Intelligence (NASDAQ:ININ), another player with some revenue coming from Cloud-based contact center software also suggests the same. The Cloud penetration is still under 10% of approximately 15.8 million contact center agents around the world, with expected TAM (total available market) of almost $24 billion in annual recurring revenues. Considering almost 75% of total contact center agents are enterprise, the potential for Five9 monetizing from this conversion is also equally strong.Recognized leader in the 'Magic Quadrant'. Image Source: Five9Within the space, Five9's strong position is also established, whether one looks at the third-party researchers like Gartner as above or the company's growth momentum, which some may call an even more reliable data point. Besides the usual aspects required out of any enterprise class software provider (i.e. end to end solution, extremely high uptime performance or security of the complete solution), the company seems to be doing a better job at managing integration partnerships with CRM providers, especially the leaders like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that can help improve visibility for this small company, and relationships with system integration partners like Deloitte and PWC. The partners influenced more than 40% of the enterprise deal flow in the last quarter, a ratio that may go higher. The growth of Cloud-based CRM service offerings may be a good leading indicator, considering the use of legacy contact center infrastructure with Cloud-based CRMs may not be the ideal way to go.Well positioned to ride the waveWhether one looks at the current growth, quality of growth or the leading indicators for the future growth, there seem enough catalysts to keep the topline growth at least at a low double-digit rate, which is not an ambitious target, considering the topline has grown at a 37% CAGR over the past seven years.The focus on pushing the more profitable and faster-growing enterprise business seems to be delivering. The business is close to 65% of the total mix, continuing a favorable shift of a 3-4% annual increase. Revenue from enterprise subscriptions grew 38% last quarter, up from the 35% growth rate during the quarter before. Growing partnerships with CRM players seem to be showing in not just the total revenue growth, but also in the average deal size and win rate against competitors. Average new enterprise deal size grew almost 29% last year and now stands close to half a million dollars, which positions it well among established software firms. The win rate against major Cloud competitors continues to be high, which was almost 70% in the most recent quarter.As for the quality of numbers, almost 96% of the revenues are recurring, giving high visibility and the retention rate on recurring revenues is above 100%. Since recurring revenues are made of monthly software subscriptions that are based on the number of agencies and the usage, as measured in minutes, a growing mix of enterprise customers and growing adoption within those customers should continue to act as a tailwind for topline growth.Besides benefiting from the growth of partners, expansion of sales capacity undertaken over the past year (almost 30-40% growth) should also start delivering, considering a lag of almost eleven months between hiring a sales person and the time they start producing revenue. Indeed, as the profitability of the business improves, investment in direct sales infrastructure should benefit, giving a further boost to the growth.Profitability is here and there is more room to growSource: Five9Last quarter was a game changer from the profitability standpoint. The gross margin improvement continued and the business achieved breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA level, three-quarters ahead of what was earlier expected. More importantly, the marginal profitability (EBITDA growth as a percentage of revenue growth) is consistent.The marginal profitability was 70% in the most recent quarter and exceeded 50% over the last four quarters, one of the best in the space. Most estimates continue to expect a loss per share for the near future.Source: FIVN presentationThe path from here to the long-term model seems clearer now. The gross margins have increased sequentially over the past fourteen out of fifteen quarters and looking at the trends (i.e. growing subscription revenues against relatively fixed costs) the momentum of improvement should continue. Having NOLs (net operating loss carry forwards) of more than $200 million should help.Relatively, the names with significant exposure to the Cloud (FIVN and SAAS) seem to be trading mostly in line, but more importantly, there is negligible acquisition premium built in the stock, which may change with a consistent performance and continued divergence in the performance of the Cloud and on-premise vendors. As for an acquisition premium, there are hardly any exactly similar deals, but going by Broadsoft (NASDAQ:BSFT) acquiring Transera, a private player with barely $7-8 million in revenue, for an undisclosed sum or Oracle acquiring Opower (NYSE:OPWR), which is growing at just a high single digit rate, at 3.5-4 times sales, expecting 5-6 times EV/sales may not be off.The small size may have been hampering the investor interest, but the same should make it a great acquisition candidate, especially now that the valuation is in a ballpark where it starts to make sense for legacy vendors to pursue. For someone like Cisco, trading at 2-2.5 times sales, acquiring a leading Cloud-based player at a premium makes sense, considering the operating synergies possible from the combination. Relatively lower revenue coming from the Cloud for inContact and Interactive Intelligence may position them less favorably in terms of an acquisition.Bottom line: Consistent growth and profitability should make FIVN dear to both investors as well legacy contact center software vendors."
4184650,21815,2018-06-29T00:39:47-04:00,"Shares of this cloud-based call center software have sharply corrected in the past week, and they're off 15% of their recent all-time highs.There is little to suggest the company will not continue to grow at the rates it has while enjoying operational leverage and being cash flow positive and non-GAAP profitable.While the shares are still expensive, they are coming into sight for investors that want a stake in the upside of this cloud SaaS player.","Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) offers a virtual contact center cloud platform containing applications for managing contact center-related customer service, sales, and marketing functions, enabling customers to manage the end-to-end (multi-channel) customer experience in a single unified architecture.In short, this is another SaaS business cloud platform, one of the most successful business models of late, as it enjoys a host of advantages. These advantages stem from the fact that moving to the cloud itself brings many advantages for customers, which explains the ongoing large-scale migration of which we're only in the first couple of innings. But the SaaS platform business model generates a host of additional benefits, the most prominent of which are the opportunities to generate additional (recurring) revenue streams.We have developed a little standard model for these kinds of cloud platform companies. For Five9, we'll discuss the most relevant of these steps. The company's earnings deck provided the most important ones as well:The killer app which the company provides is customer contact center (""call center"") software, and as management stresses repetitively, cloud penetration is still low (10%-15%) and there is $24 billion TAM of possible recurring revenue waiting.The opportunity certainly seems substantial, given the growth rate of the company's revenue (25% in Q1) and even more so of a particular and growing part of revenues - that of the enterprise market (as opposed to the slower-growing commercial business). Enterprise revenues are growing at a really substantial 38% rate, and these customers also come with a higher ROI, so management is concentrating its efforts on this segment.A couple of years back, SA contributor Terrier Investing made a couple of insightful observations:These are useful antidotes against too much optimism or (in the case of Terrier Investing) too high valuation. On the other hand, that article was written more than two years ago, and the company has continued to grow at roughly the same 34% pace:FIVN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAnd as you can see, that adds up. Operationally, things have also improved quite a lot. Gartner has identified Five9 as one of the three leaders in the sector, which should ease those competition concerns a little. From the company's earnings deck:So we can safely say that the story is on considerable firmer ground compared to a couple of years ago. A further sign of its competitive success is that management argues that the company's win rate against its two key cloud competitors is in excess of 75%.Apart from adding new customers, the company also gains from extending its footprint with existing customers by adding seats. Here is how it prices (from the Q1CC):Seats are added at existing customers (the CC contains an example of a customer doing just that), but we don't have information about the extent of this. We assume this grows with the growth rate of the customers' businesses.Five9 has a hands-on approach to implementation and migration for its customers, hence 8% of revenue (in Q1 2018) is generated by service income. The service business sullies margins a bit, but the company just turned positive for services.At present, just 10% of Five9's sales are from abroad, so there is quite a bit of room here should it start to emphasize foreign expansion (there are no indications management is doing that at the moment).The company has a lot of partnerships that are quite important:Most notable are the technology partnerships like CRM (customer relationship management) players. From the Q1CC:This is really important. For instance, its partnership with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) gives the company early versions of its software, something that not all of its competitors get. This allows the company quick integration with newer versions and new functionality for Salesforce customers (for instance, the ones moving from its classic to the lightening version).Its routing engine (routing voice, email, chat, etc. to the right agent) can also feed agents and applications from other providers like CRM partners. Integration is important here.But it's not only technology integration, it's also referrals. The likes of Salesforce and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and a host of other partners also bring Five9 customers (even if this doesn't provide all that much leverage in the sales process because the company normally puts its own sales team on new customers).But in Q1, no less than 55% of enterprise deals went through its ecosystem of partners, underlying its importance.The company has added bells and whistles to its offerings. From its website:And still more are planned. From the Q1CC:We have come across other SaaS cloud-based business software platform companies that stray beyond their core functionality into adjacent ones, but that's not what the company is doing, at least not for now. Instead, it has chosen to integrate with the main suppliers of what is the most obvious adjacent functionality - CRM. But the company is otherwise sticking closely to its core functionality while enhancing that.Straying little from core functionality limits the up-sell opportunities somewhat, and it's therefore not surprising that Five9 enjoys a dollar base retention rate (Q1 2018) of 98%. We've seen other business platform with much higher rates, well above 100%.The adjusted gross margin has been increasing every quarter for the last 21 quarters (y/y), which is quite an achievement. It came in at 62.3% in Q1, another 500 basis point improvement (y/y).The long-term goal is to achieve adjusted gross margins between 65% and 70%, and the company isn't all that far off anymore. Closing the gap will be driven as follows (from the Q1CC):There is also considerable operational leverage already (non-GAAP):Its EBITDA margins improved considerably (7.2 percentage points to 12.7%), but half of that (3.6 percentage points) came from the accounting change. Nevertheless, EBITDA margins have improved for 18 consecutive quarters - quite an achievement. The intermediate-term goal is 22-27%.FIVN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsFive9 is already cash flow positive. But as you see, all of that is due to stock-based compensation:FIVN Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsAs a result, it is still on an upward-sloping share count graph.The company's seasonally weakest Q2 is expected to deliver:For FY2018:FIVN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsEven after the recent correction in the share price, shares still go for almost 9x sales. But this is what one expects, given the business model, the revenue growth, the operational leverage and the fact that the company is already cash flow positive (albeit, entirely thanks to share-based compensation).Analysts expect a 2018 EPS of $0.28 rising to $0.43 next year, although valuations on earnings are, of course, still in the stratosphere.The shares were doing pretty well until recently:In just a week, shares are off already nearly 16% from their all-time highs set earlier this month. But given that valuations are still very high, this tells you something about what the market is willing to pay for these kinds of SaaS platforms.We see no obvious reason why the company cannot continue to grow like it has been doing until now, and therefore, shares can command a high valuation, which is added to further by underlying takeover speculation.How high really depends on what the market tolerates, and that toleration seems to be decreasing as we write. So, we would sit on the sidelines for a bit longer and see how the present market correction in these types of stocks plays out. If you can't contain yourself, we would advise buying in parts on dips."

Talkdesk, a privately held digital call center software creator, just two weeks ago raised an additional $15 million (bringing its total since 2011 to $18 million - which according to its CEO Tiago Paiva Talkdesk the company still has ""pretty much"" in the bank (SOURCE: techcrunch.com interview)) to further its already successful expansion efforts.Talkdesk plans to hire ""around 40 sales people in the next 7 months or so"" and then consider an IPO. Again, according to its CEO. So, by all indications Talkdesk is actively pursuing a monetizable exit strategy and again this is one that I think would be in Five9's best interest to accommodate.Why should Five9 spend any focus on this idea rather than continue to keep its head down and further the momentum generated at Q1/15 reporting?Well for starters Talkdesk would provide it with an SMB outlet and revenue segment that should be an autopilot-growth opportunity. Talkdesk has accumulated ~2000 customers and with the low/no CAPEX cost (for customers deploying Talkdesk) and quick uptime from inception of its solution the company stands to be able to accumulate many more in a short period of time with the right funding mix. Obviously this is what's motivating the IPO (that and the lucrative payouts to employees once shares exit lock-up).There's also that Five9 and Talkdesk share quite a few name brand integrations that would translate well from a sales training standpoint (meaning creating ease of training for the NewCo sales force), wouldn't require integration acceptance from key integration partners for the platforms to be able to create an SMB/enterprise solution that looks highly similar (key partners like Zendesk, salesforce.com, etc.), and a NewCo would create an upmarket funnel that could service customers as they (presumably and hopefully for the NewCo) grow usage demands.Now, with Talkdesk being private who really knows what its current valuation is. Talkdesk CEO Tiago Paiva made note that market participants shouldn't make assumptions in regards to his company's valuation based on the size of its recent raise. That said, Five9 did close Q1/15 with $70.6 million in C&CE but has a $19.5 million chunk of debt coming due in 2016. Based on the sheer inconsistency with which Five9 has operated since coming public I'm not so sure we should assume that gets refinanced further down the road.Still, assuming Talkdesk's valuation hasn't reached levels of absurdity - they really shouldn't have considering the uber-competitive, low barrier to entry, hard to differentiate space in which the company operates, Five9 has financing options (presumably, if it can make a case to investors/lenders that a NewCo would solve those key issues I just presented). These are options that I think Five9 should exhaust.With the IPO market showing T24M that it can be punitive to SAAS models in times of volatility and/or with anything but solid long-term viability (I actually like Talkdesk's model a lot more than Five9's despite the major arguments against there ever being a dominant market share aggregator in this space that is ""racing to zero"" - ex. the massive legacy enterprises) Talkdesk might be inclined to just take a private side buyout/merger opportunity than go through the headache of an IPO.Five9 should hope so.Continue to wait on Five9 shares despite a great quarter that fed me some humble pie at last reporting.Good luck everybody."
2970336,48411,2015-03-03T18:16:16-05:00,"FIVN has all the same concerns that bothered me at 1H/14 reporting.The company has now also evidenced that it has an unrealistic and unreliable growth strategy that shows just how lost it is.While not in any real near-term financial stress, FIVN's C&CE balance is on the clock, as the company has shown zero top-line growth and accelerating cash burn.Continue to avoid FIVN.","Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN), what a mess.FIVN's Q4 and full-year numbers (and the conference call that followed) were a great reflection of what this company has become. A stumbling, bumbling mess that I continue to recommend readers avoid even at a heavily discounted market cap to its once proud IPO.FIVN's chart agrees:All the concerns that I had prior to Q3 reporting remain in place. FIVN still hasn't shown an acceleration of growth even with increased S&M spend and greater G&A; it still hasn't shown a stop to the dollar-based retention bleed that first evidenced itself at 1H/14 reporting; and the company still has mid-term cash concerns when taking into account its growth initiatives.FIVN's revenue growth rate peaked in 2011, when its technology and solution was still considered innovative. Since then, it's been a more than slow race to zero, as the company has used convenient excuses like ""well, we're switching to an enterprise sales focus rather than SMB,"" and ""well the ACA hurt us,"" and anything else that's readily available. The bottom line (or is it the top line?) is that the growth at the company has slowed dramatically and doesn't appear to be coming back anytime soon. Growth that FIVN built its model on and around. Growth that FIVN increased spending into, assuming it would be seeing the fruits of its labors by now. Growth that is going to be hard to peel back now that it's ""at scale."" I've seen this before, when the inputs to a long-term model are incorrect or don't prove out, and it never ends well. You could say this company's story is already a nightmare of sorts for those long from as high as ~$9/share, but I think it continues to get worse.Again, FIVN's long-term plan was based on (in my opinion) at the very least mid-20% growth for 2015 and 2016, with (in my opinion) mid-30% to low-40% growth modeled in for 2014. Basically, what I'm saying is that FIVN had its rate of growth being much higher when it decided to make its scale-up move in the early going. I don't believe it ever imagined growth would slow at the pace that it has. That assumption miss should force management to significantly change its long-term strategy, but as of a February investor presentation, it doesn't look like it has:I was able to poke holes in every single long-term growth driver at FIVN. Most of them are, at this point, outright fantasies. For instance, the company wants ""increase sales in existing base (of customers),"" when it has shown a 700 bps dollar-based retention contraction since 1H/14 reporting. It wants to expand via ""selective acquisition,"" when it just burned through $31.2 million in cash during full-year 2014 and only has $78.3 million left - cash that it needs to pay down debts that it just had 12-month extensions on. Basically, this plan isn't realistic or reliable. If this is the best that FIVN had as of two weeks ago, this is reason enough not to own this name.Here's a bit more granular look at FIVN's ever-expanding overhead and cost structure. Remember, none of this is doing anything to drive the rate of growth or slow the pace of cash burn:Again, I believe this to make the long-term model hypotheticals unrealistic and not reliable:The fact that the company claims to be able to use expanding sales from its existing base of customers, but plans to need a midpoint 30% S&M budges (of revenues) long-term is absurd. That's not something I want any part of.A more granular look at the cash run rate at FIVN:To be clear, FIVN has more than enough cash to last the next 12 months and into its debt repayment if those obligations aren't further kicked down the road. My concern comes post-2016, when the company starts to run really low on cash and will have shown most likely a mid-teen growth rate or at worst a sub-ten percent growth rate. FIVN's in no near-term risk of anything serious financially, but that doesn't mean that shares can run much lower. Even at today's pricing, it has a market cap of ~$193 million.If you want a good look at a technology/idea that: 1) doesn't work; 2) has shown to have reached peak growth and is slowing quickly; 3) has mid-term cash concerns with zero attractiveness to the credit markets; and 4) appears to have no realistic plan for fixing it, look no further than Care.com (NYSE:CRCM). Ask yourself if you really want to be a part of something resembling that disaster before investing in FIVN.I continue to recommend readers avoid this name."
3234626,48411,2015-06-04T00:16:30-04:00,"Has momentum finally shifted in FIVN's favor?A blowout Q1/15 has FIVN back on the big board.Now, it's all just a waiting game - FIVN only has to prove out the momentum shift is real to have me recommending a long position.Shares haven't really reacted to the quarter so if FIVN can post a follow on blowout - look out above.Continue to wait on FIVN but have it on your big board for sure.","It's time to eat a little humble pie for me and I'll be eating that humble pie courtesy of Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) which reported a really, really strong Q1/15. Now, we're still going to have to wait and see if FIVN is ready to be long position because one quarter of production after several quarters of growing concern does not make a trend change but it's definitely a strong start. FIVN hit on all the metrics I asked it to hit on except one and (also as I asked) it has a clear, concise, detailed explanation for the ""miss"". FIVN did a great job, plain and simple. Still wait on shares but add FIVN to the watch list. This is a name that could get going fast.The big problems I had with FIVN, which is a call center based SMB/enterprise solution, were 1) that it was appearing more and more that there were some structural issues present and 2) FIVN's cash burn was accelerating and approaching ""on the clock"" rates - rates that would have it raising/running into debt payment issues, etc. Of course, FIVN came through in a big way on both.At Q1/15 reporting FIVN showed that, at least for the quarter, it doesn't have a structural retention and sales problem. FIVN got back to growth and held its key metric, dollar based retention rate to a 100 bps reduction sequentially (still down 500 bps Y/Y but explainable). The excusing factor for the sequential, and now patterned reduction, is that FIVN had a good explanation for the reduction. One customer who is on an older international pricing schedule has reduced usage temporarily as the customer is getting smoked on the strong dollar (creating a negative FX impact for the customer) and FIVN had a semi sizeable customer go out of business. Neither have anything to do with FIVN and that's a darn good thing for longs.As for growth/cash burn which is equally important and a play off of the retention rates, both got back to good graces. Growth was upgraded to 16%-20% on a full year guidance basis which is still too low for what I want to see but I don't think it outside the realm of possibility for FIVN to come back with higher guidance if we're really seeing a sea change from a sentiment and use case acceptance standpoint in the industry.Everything, all the problems with a FIVN investment that I have outlined in two prior articles, is a play on growth with this company because FIVN needs to see big growth to leverage its model into a slower cash burn rate. You could say that about any company sure, but this is especially magnified with the SAAS tech companies.Everything with these tech companies should be based on cash - not GAAP net loss which can be skewed by several line items. In regards to cash, FIVN closed the quarter with $70.6 million in C&CE which gives it ample timeline to that being a concern even if growth does take a few quarters longer to prove out to higher levels. The big reason why I'd like to see a straight line continuation to execution rather than an infrequent higher high (adjusted for FIVN's slow transition to an enterprise software company - this skews revenue recognition and cash inflows to Q3/Q4) is that FIVN has a chunk of debt coming due in 2016 (~$19.5 million) that I'd rather see it refinance down the road than pay off. Terms for refinancing get a lot better looking when you can show accelerating growth and cash burn reductions.Now, how was the growth driven and where is this sudden outperformance coming from? To keep things concise, mainly from two sources: ""partners"" and general market acceptance. So Michael Huang, an analyst from Needham & Company made a good point on the Q1/15 investor call that the hybrid-cloud players across the board have really seen a good Q1/15 and have guided well. The consensus in the analyst community is that there seems to be a growing acceptance that the legacy, on premise services are not going to be able to hang around much longer (at acceptable levels of efficacy) and that has driven a renewed focus and sex appeal on the cloud guys. That I'm sure played a role. The question is how much of a role.The other growth driver was FIVN seeing good traction generated by partners. CEO Mike Burkland elaborated on the investor call:Definitely encouraging, and FIVN did mention they have been able to consistently hire top talent from legacy providers as of late - which should do well to shorten sales cycles and increase overall efficiency, but depending on partners to generate sales and drive relevancy isn't something I want to invest in. Again, this is something that I'm going to need to see some consistency in prior to initiating a long position.All told the quarter was great. Everything I has asked for prior for executed on and overall guidance looks good. The only objection I have to initiating a position right here is that the outside factors are implying that this could still not be the real deal. The fact that the space heated up AND that FIVN made several comments on the investor call about Oracle being a big help to driving demand makes me the slightest bit conservative. There are some ""wait and see"" qualities surrounding both ideas and I think I would rather wait and see considering my prior thoughts on the company.But don't get confused. FIVN just maybe had its biggest quarter, all things considered, since coming public and that matters. Good for it and good for you if you bought this name on the lows. I was wrong. But I'll continue to wait on shares to make sure FIVN is right.Good luck everybody."
2943876,72665,2015-02-25T08:45:00-05:00,Significantly undervalued stock with a potential 125% upside.Best of breed cloud solutions provider in a largely untapped enterprise market.Business model with a high degree of operating leverage.,"What customers' problem(s) do Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) hosted contact-center solutions solve?Five9 Software (NOT telephony infrastructure) solution enables enterprise customers to:I highlighted the fact that Five9 is not a network/telecom infrastructure solution provider to clear the misconception that Five9 business model is driven by low margin commoditized telecom capacity. Rather, Five9 provides the value-add/high gross margin SaaS-based software that resides on top of the network infrastructure. The Company's solutions allows enterprise customers to design, manage and optimize multi-channel customer communications and interaction through its customer interaction management platform that unifies data, information and communication at point of needs across multiple channels.While I realize that the D&A of purchased 3rd party computer telephony integration capacity deflates the accounting gross profits, I would like to remind investors of the operating leverage significance of these fixed costs, driven by the ongoing increase in recurring 'usage' of the platform. In other words, subscription gross profit should uptick upward, as the upcoming waves of subscription renewals start to be recognized, at no marginal cost.Economics of a call centerThe majority of contact-centers operations fall into one or more of the following three broad categories: 1) B2B cost centers, 2) Advisory services profit centers (e.g. banking and financial advisory services sales lead management) and 3) large scale B2C services cost centers (e.g. telecom customer on-boarding, insurance claim management, retail dispute resolutions, utilities account management, personal banking services). Considering a typical call center operated by a hypothetical company B2C HappyConsumer Co. [HC]. HC's call center handles inbound/outbound call volume of 525/hour, has an average handle time of 7.16 minutes, has 75 agent seats, operates on a 12-hour/six-day schedule. The call center has a per call cost of $0.19 in technology, $0.22 in telecom and networking, $0.14 in tech-support labor and a fully-loaded monthly payroll cost per agent of $4.2K. Assuming the HC's call center operates at full capacity, it will have an annual operating expense of ~$4.8M for labor and technology/network charges.SaaS/Hosted call center ROI - Selling on a return on investment solution-based modelAs opposed to on-premise-based call center, a SaaS or hosted-based call center has an estimated (technology +network+ tech support) cost per call of $0.011, resulting in ~$1M or 20 cents on a dollar in annual savings for our hypothetical company HappyConsumer Co. (HC).Aside from cost saving, what other key factors determine customers' supplier choice?From an enterprise customer point-of-view, a contact-center solution/vendor must have the following characteristics:Source: RightNow surveyMarket SizingMy bottom-down analysis of the cloud-based contact-center market yielded a market size opportunity of ~$9.9B. Using an estimated weighted Average Handle Time (AHT) of 7.16 minutes, total solution cost per minute of $0.011, and assuming the average sized contact-center operates for 12 hours per day on a six-day schedule, I estimate the monthly cost per agent seat is $159 or $1,905 in annual costs. Gartner estimates there are 14.5M contact-center agents worldwide, resulting in total North American market size of ~$9.9B and a worldwide potentially addressable market size of $19.3B. The market is divided into four broad categories: Interactive CRM-integrated customer service platform, web self-service, social community and lead management for sales.Market OverviewTwo trends drive call center market: Benefits of scale in call center operations and customer service as a competitive differentialOver the past 20 years, many enterprises outsourced their call center operations to service bureaus. The driving business logic behind the non-captive call center model had been the goal of achieving greater economies of scale through higher capacity utilization rates and shared cost of new technology among a larger base of agent.Now, contact-centers are being handed a far more encompassing mandate as the central depository of customer information. In industries such as telecommunication and financial services, products and services have become commoditized and customer service delivery is becoming a core differentiator. As such, investments in contact-centers technologies are now leveraged to apply new metrics to customer contact, aligning the front-lines of a call-center with the business goals of sales and marketing. Accordingly, call center technologies became more pervasive throughout the enterprise, expanding beyond the walls of the call-center and into business executives' offices.In addition, the complexity of contact-center solutions has significantly increased because of leveraging many applications and interaction channels. As such, enterprise customers would now choose a vendor that has the capacity to handle this complex model in a multi-modal environment, seamlessly integrating business applications and devices to communication application services.As such, the major distinguishing factor of a strong SaaS contact-center solution is in its scalability for mission critical complex operational environment, allowing for reasoning and case routing, skill-based case assignment, real-time customer service personalization, no lock-in CTI integration, and seamless integration with interactive voice responses (IVR) systems.Inbound vs. outbound call Inbound Call Processing - Automated Call Distributors (ACD) and Interactive Voice Response (IVR)At the heart of a contact-center, the Automated Call Distributor (ACD), factors in an agent's average call handling time, ranks a customer call importance and generates real-time call traffic reports, aiding in the monitoring of and reacting to call queue activity.Besides the ACD, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) allows customers to interact with an enterprise's database in order to retrieve information without the aid of an agent [e.g. checking an account balance]. In addition, given that customers can access and modify information through either phone self-service or through the web, many customers' calls into a contact-center are for complex inquiries. As such, live agents must be up-to-date with customers' information and prior requests, leading to the evolution of unified agent desktop that aggregates customers' information from the CRM and ERP applications and that brings a 360 view of the customer in one interface, making it easier for a live agent to provide a better service.Outbound - Predictive DialersPredictive dialer automates the dialing process and synchronizes the voice of the 'called' customer with the relevant CRM data to the next available agent's desktop. Once the call is presented to the agent, the customer's or prospect's real-time information and a script simultaneously appear on the agent's screen. In addition, the solution could now be integrated with speech analytics tools, which utilize text-to phrase interpretation for greater accuracy in the 90% range.Enterprise adoption of SaaS contact-center solutionsThe first wave of enterprise adoption of SaaS contact-center solution was driven by improvements in network infrastructure, increasing reliability and supporting seamless content/data delivery. The second wave of enterprise adoption hinges upon business partners agreement on customer data integration, master data management and security standards.In addition, enterprise adoption is accelerated by many IT centers managers at major enterprises, who have become frustrated with the currently adopted complex architecture of Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)-based automatic based distributors (ACD) systems that queue/route calls across desperate geographies. Enterprise customers have used Cisco's unified intelligent contact management enterprise (UICME) to monitor the complex networks of automatic distributors.Maturation of internet technologies driving adoptionThe proliferation of packet-switched networks enabled the seamless transmission of unprecedented amounts of real-time data, driving enterprise adoption of 'off-premise' software services. As opposed to circuit-switched networks, a single packet-switched network is able to deliver disparate forms of communications, significantly reducing the cost of transmission.Packet vs. CircuitCircuit-switched networks have dominated voice networks such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In circuit switching, the line or path between the two parties remains constant throughout the call. On the other hand, in packet switching, packets of the same message can travel in different order and through different routes. Moreover, numerous packets from different communications are sent over the same line, resulting in significantly higher network utilization rates.Hurdles to enterprise adoption of SaaS contact-center solutionsCompany BackgroundFive9 is a provider of multi-channel contact-center solution, which is a core pillar in relationship-based customer engagement architecture that underpins cross-channel sales, marketing and service processes. As a leading vendor through the current renaissance of Business Process Management (BPM) for customer service, Five9 built its technology using the concept of a 'customer process' that enables configuration rather than coding, enabling enterprises to customize the contact-center solution to reach end customers' various touch points (e.g. mobile, social). Five9 particular strength is in its infrastructure for collaboration software, speech applications, call routing and its seamless integration with Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) CRM systems.Financial Model OverviewRevenue modelThe revenue model is driven by minutes usage, preset number of agent IDs or enterprise wide license (EWL) agreements. The percentage of enterprise customers continues to trend upward; the mix-shift supports management assertion of tilting the business model toward an enterprise focused model. As enterprise adoption of SaaS-based contact-center grows, I expect Five9's dollar retention rate (includes up-sell) to trend upward from 98% inQ4-14 to a long- term SaaS peers rate of ~115%.I attempted to reach annual revenue estimates by building a bottom-up budget forecast of enterprise sales hiring plans. The bottom-up forecast model is primarily driven by estimated enterprise sales headcount (2015 headcount source: LinkedIn), annual quota per rep and dollar retention rate. My analysis yielded revenue estimates of $117.2M and $150.8M for FY15 and FY16, respectively, and FY29 revenue estimate of ~$800M, representing a 15 years CAGR of 14%.Cost of revenueIn Q3-14, pro-forma gross margin (i.e. excluding purchased telecom capacity D&A) was 53.3%, up 690 bps y/y and 180 bps sequentially. As the platform scales, I expect further leverage of the technology infrastructure and support services.Research & developmentLifecycle driven, R&D spend is a leading indicator of the success or failure of a technology market disruptor. As such, R&D spend for a disruptor, such as Five9, would typically go through the following three phases:Phase 1 (total revenue: $0 to $50M/R&D>25% of total revenue): Creating an innovative product/solution that disrupts an existing market.Phase 2 (total revenue: $75M to $150M/R&D ~16% to 23% of total revenue): Continuing to build innovate solutions that sustain accelerated growth, while creating solution add-ons and/or version upgrades that would help the company expand into new verticals and that are backward-compatible so that the existing installed base can easily or almost seamlessly upgrade to get the latest AND the relevant features and functionalities. Though, from an customer point-of-view, compatibility is less of an issue in the case of an 'off-premise'/hosted solution.Phase 3 (total revenue: >$200M/ R&D:10% - 15% of total revenue): Having a healthy long-term R&D spend range to maintain customers' perception of an innovative organization.Five9 is currently in phase two. The company's commitment to product innovation and to moving upmarket is evident in its allocation of as much as 45.6% of FY14 gross profit and 43% of FY13 gross profit to R&D.Sales and MarketingAs Five9 hosted contact-center model makes the leap toward enterprise acceptance, I expect the company to benefit over time from lower churn rates, leading to a reduction in sales and marketing allocation. During the initial 9 months of 2014, the company spent, on average, 69.0% of gross profit on sales and marketing, representing 35.8% of total revenue; this compared to 69.4% of gross profit and 32.3% of total revenue in 2013.Marketing StrategyBased on my experience, I believe that Five9, at this initial stage of its life cycle, most likely allocates the majority of its marketing dollars to user conferences and analyst relations (typically ~60% of marketing spend). I believe that it is vital for a market disruptor such as Five9 to develop analyst relations and broaden coverage early-on, given the analysts' major influence on enterprise customers purchasing decisions.Sales ModelFive9's marketing strategy and lead development is driven by the following: 1) analyst relations and 2) a named-account marketing approach that focuses on specific list of target accounts assigned to a sales development director. The list typically includes a mix of existing customers and prospects. The approach aligns with the Five9's low velocity sales-model, which currently is driving growth from a defined universe of specific target accounts.Typical sales cycle length under a low velocity modelThe average sales cycle length under a low-velocity model is 20 weeks. The cycle is initiated by marketing/prospecting and ends with contract negotiation and singing of the master service agreement.I hypothesize that this low-velocity model (i.e. small number of large size deals) may have been the main factor behind the slight Q2/Q3 revenue slippage to the following quarters as it is much difficult for management to put a firm number on what the right level of expected net new customer wins are each quarter. Nonetheless, senior management are strongly committed to building a metric driven business that allows for in-period tweaking through constant performance monitoring, increasing the like-hood of reaching the growth targets set out in the business plan.That being said, I believe that the importance of 'planting-more-trees' / 'winning new customers' early-on by a market disruptor outweighs the significance of a quarter-to-quarter revenue volatility.Attempting to gauge the value creation potential of sales and marketing spend, I estimated the company's payback on sales and marketing by dividing the annualized net gross profit added during a given quarter by the sales and marketing costs of the prior quarter. The payback time on sales and marketing peaked in the pre-IPO quarter Q4-2013 at 1.47x , but decreased to a normalized level of 0.47x in Q3-14; in other words, for each incremental S&M $1 spent, $0.47 is paid back within a year.I expect sales and marketing to decline to 34% of revenue by FY16 from an estimated 37% in FY14.Channel partnersFive9 is within the early stages of developing its partner channel. A channel synergy would increase Five9's ability to facilitate inbound/outbound customer interactions across channels. For a customer experience management vendor such as Five9, the partner channels would typically include the following: 1) Inbound/Outbound OEMs (e.g. SAS, Salesforce's Radian6), 2) Consultant/System Integrators (e.g. (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Capgemini (CAP.PA)), 3) Strategic Resellers (Avaya, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Netsuite (NYSE:N), Oracle Rightnow (NYSE:ORCL), Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), Nice Systems (NASDAQ:NICE)).ValuationDCF model suggests a share price for Five9 of $8.60. My primary assumptions include an estimated (Beta) of 1.23, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10.6%, and long-term growth rate g of 5.0%. I arrive at an intrinsic value per share of $8.60 by growing my estimate of FY-2015 revenue by a CAGR of 14% for 20 years and applying a steady-state operating margin of 14.5% to my 2034 revenue estimate. 8.60/share represents a valuation of 3.5x FYE-15 revenue and 2.7x FYE-16 revenue compared to 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) multiples of 3.8x FYE-15 revenue and 3.1x FYE-16 revenue. The DCF exercise helps enumerate the potential benefits of implicit longer-term margin expansion and top-line growth. However, the intrinsic valuation model is highly sensitive to inputs and assumptions (e.g. WACC, steady state period and growth rate); therefore, as investors continue to adjust expected return, intrinsic implied share prices can vary widely.Net Operating Losses [NOLs] could also add incremental $0.64 to my estimated $8.60 fair value per shareAs part of my fair value analysis, I calculated the value of net operating losses, which theoretically can be used to reduce future taxes paid. The value of the NOLs is based on the projected usage benefit in the projection period and is discounted at the cost of equity of 10.76%. In my base operating scenario, I estimate that the fair value of the NOLs is $0.64 per share. Adding back the estimated value of the NOL yields an intrinsic price per share value of ~$9.25.Industry consolidation and financial sponsors' interest in the spaceGenesysOn October 18th, 2011, Permira (through Permira IV) and Technology Crossover Ventures acquired the contact center business unit of Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) (i.e. Genesys) for €1.24B ($1.70B). In 2010, Genesys had revenue of ~$529M and EBITDA margin of ~35%, implying a trailing transaction multiples of 3.2x revenue and 9.3x EBITDA. Alcatel had acquired Genesys in an all-stock transaction valued at also ~$1.5bn in September 1999. However, in the fiscal year ending June 1999, Genesys had only a revenue of $139m and an operating margin of ~20%, valuing Genesys at a multiple of 10.5x revenue and >53x EBIT.How much did the sponsors pay for their implied estimate of Genesys growth (pre-rollups)?Through June 2014, Permira IV (vintage year: 2006), delivered, on average, 1.54x investment multiple. Applying the 1.54x money multiple to the initial $1.70B initial investment yields $2.61B Yr(5) exit value. The transaction was financed at a total leverage of 7x LTM EBITDA or at a debt/equity ratio of ~3x (i.e. ~75% debt/25% equity), yielding a gross IRR of 23.7%. Based on these calculations and holding the entry/exit transactions' multiple constant at 9.3x EBITDA and also holding the revenue/EBITDA relationship constant (i.e. assuming flat EBITDA margins), I estimate the sponsors factored in a 9.0% in annualized growth, paying 0.33x growth.The LBO exercise serves as confirmatory tool, helping to 'sanity check' my valuation/growth relationship assumptions against the sponsors' presumed pre-LBO assumptions.Genesys has focused on the high end of on-premise contact-center solutions market; however, the Company has been making strides in both the pure cloud and hybrid on-premise/cloud solutions market. Its entry and growth in the cloud market was inorganically driven through the acquisition of MicroStrategy's cloud-based (CEM) customer experience management unit Angel.com. Genesys acquired the Angel.com unit at a multiple of 3.8x Angel.com's 2012 reported revenues of $29 million, valuing the unit at $110M. In July 2013, Genesys acquired SoundBite for $100M, valuing the company at 2.1x revenue. The acquisition augmented the Angel.com acquisition, adding more than 1,200 cloud customers.In addition, Genesys acquired Echopass, which had been sellings cloud solutions linked to Genesys software. The acquisition was envisioned to help Genesys accelerate its presence in the cloud market. As opposed to Angel.com and Soundbite, which both increased Genesys presence in the small and mid-market cloud market, Echopass served as the launchpad to expand into the enterprise cloud-based contact-center solutions market. Currently, Genesys generates 25% of its $800M total revenue from its cloud business.Kana Software acquisition by Accel-KKR*On October 27th 2009, an affiliate of Accel-KKR acquired KANA for ~$41M, valuing the company at 0.9x revenue. KANA was founded as provider of enterprise Service Resolution Management (SRM) software solutions, primarily knowledge-powered customer service solutions that provide information to answer customer inquiries (web, chat, voice). In 2Q11, Kana acquired Overtone, a provider of social media and customer listening platforms. On 10 July 2012, Kana Software announced its acquisition of Ciboodle, a customer service software application provider, from the Sword Group. The Ciboodle acquisition was intended to strengthen KANA's customer service application capabilities and to extend its reach in social CRM. KANA's acquisition strategy seemed to be centered on combining customer experience management software with big data analyticsOn January 7th 2014, Verint (NASDAQ:VRNT) acquired KANA for $514M, valuing KANA at 3.5x revenues and 11.4x adjusted EBITDA.*Technology-focused fund created through a partnership between Accel Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Robert (NYSE:KKR)Avaya: Major on-premise competitor strugglesAvaya continues to struggle in the cloud contact center market, losing its on-premises customers to cloud competitors such Genesys and Interactive (NASDAQ:ININ).

3322165,48411,2015-07-13T17:42:05-04:00,Roughly a month ago I made a recommendation that Five9 think about a merger with privately held digital call center software creator Talkdesk.I made this recommendation in that I thought Talkdesk would bring several advantages both offensive and defensive to Fiv9 - most notably a midmarket presence.It appears the funding markets agree with me in that this is a niche of the overall market that needs aggregated as yet another competitor executes a funding round.PE and Venture investors want in on the total space with a focus on the less competitive midmarket - this shrinks the TAM of the space greatly.Should Five9 need to fall back on the midmarket a bit after chasing upmarket enterprise it might not be there.,"Roughly a month ago I made a recommendation that Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) think about a merger with privately held digital call center software creator Talkdesk. I made this recommendation in that Talkdesk would be an easy integration, that Talkdesk would allow Five9 an enterprise-midmarket ""farm system"" of sorts that it could monetize and potentially feed upmarket to its enterprise focus, that Five9 could become more defensive in fragmenting its overall revenue dependency from strictly being on large enterprise, and because clearly the private funding markets were placing a valuation premium on the mid and downmarket solution providers.Obviously my opinion hasn't changed in the three weeks or so that have passed. Based on India-based Ameyo's announcement that it's raised $5 million via a Series A while having just 1600 customers, largely enterprise but also a presence in the mid-size market, apparently neither has the overall funding markets. Ameyo's round was led by Indian PE Forum Synergies. Along with its announcement of its capital injection Ameyo also announced that it's coming stateside. This isn't a good thing for Five9 in any way and might have larger implications than are implied at first look.Again, I think that Five9 is allowing a first mover opportunity to slip through its figurative hands by not pursuing the mid and downmarket enterprise markets. I like this market and I just think in a space that is racing to zero and a space where no real differentiation exists that market share and platform familiarity are going to be the real defense mechanisms of the future. Five9 with its funding, its actual solution, and with its close ties to Oracle should be expanding as fast as possible to establish both of these. Instead, it's decided to stay acutely focused on upper market enterprise - which is fine and I hope works out for the company. I just think that Five9 could deploy capital and add to its overall model by expanding into the peripheral.Now, with the likes of Talkdesk, Ameyo, Incontact, and others having almost an exclusive focus on the mid-market and with these competitors in general coming into the arena Five9 is facing several new risk introductions it didn't face just 24 months ago. More competition isn't a good thing period especially when that more competition is new competition focused on a separately market that may or may not be there should Five9 have to fall back on it at some point. The fact that the TAM is being fragmented even further than it was and was projected to be puts Five9 in a very tough spot in which it needs to have success in the upmarket. I'm not saying it can't, I'm just saying it needs to.I think the competition being market all-inclusive and to a greater total degree is something that Five9 investors should consider when thinking about Five9's long term market cap growth. You have to consider that, again, in a space racing to zero with no differentiation the long term implications of this.I still applaud Five9 for its last quarter reported and or its multi-quarter efforts having shown a real momentum shift but I think that quite a bit has happened in the last 4 months or so and that investors need now not only pay attention to the public markets but also the private. I'll keep investors abreast as I notice developments taking place.I continue to recommend a wait and see on Five9.Good luck everybody."
2629465,48411,2014-11-04T06:15:00-05:00,"FIVN shares dropped 25% at Q2 reporting because of the first signs of slowing growth and increased churn rate, both which were unexpected.Should FIVN report results during Q3 that show at least an ability to meet Q2 lowered guidance shares should be able to trade higher into the new range.However, should FIVN report anything other than stability and a reversion back to higher growth rates shares will likely be clipped another large percentage.","Five9, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FIVN) short and mid-term trading future will largely be determined by what the company reports during Q3 Earnings on November 6th. The cloud software provider for contact centers reported some alarming figures during its Q2 and 1H reporting period that dropped shares ~25% overnight and established the much lower trading range that shares have been in since.The numbers reported weren't horrible but it was what was in the lowered guidance and the first showing of a decay in the company's, what had been up to that point, excellent revenue retention rate that forced those long the stock to reevaluate the future growth prospects and the valuation of the company. Clearly, this first chink in the armor of FIVN has those still long shares and those considering an entry watching very closely what is reported in a few days.I think that with a positive showing FIVN should be able to play its uptick in enterprise new customer bookings into some positive momentum and possibly test the top-end of the new trading range which would have shares trading around $6 per share. However, with anything but a showing that Q2 was a one-off and not a problem that will take time sort out or a problem that is becoming a ""new normal"" for the company, which would imply that days of mid-20% revenue growth are gone and that a normal growth rate in the high teens should be expected, the shares could experience another large percentage drop. If FIVN's revenue growth is called into question that would place a much larger focus on near-term issues exacerbated by the drop in revenue, items including short-term debt maturity, growth funding, etc., all of which FIVN would have to get very creative to find solutions for.This article will recommend an avoidance of a long position until after Q3 numbers are released and will make the argument that an overnight short position at earnings, which could turn into a mid-term short position, could provide excellent returns if done in small size. There does still exist some upside risk to FIVN demonstrating the Q2 issues have been resolved or are in the process of being resolved but I think the upward move will be more measured and slow than any downward move on bad reporting.FIVN's Operational TremorsFIVN provides cloud software for contact centers which allows organizations of all sizes to transition from legacy on premise contact center systems to a cloud solution. It provides several iterations of its software based on need and its open architecture allows the customer to tailor the software even further to fit the specific needs of the situation. FIVN can provide ready to use software that is preset for blended call centers, outbound call centers, inbound call centers, and multi-channel call centers which I think provides excellent versatility for the smaller enterprises that FIVN targets that may need immediate integration and/or may not have the staffing or expertise to customize at the company level. Historically this all-inclusive product umbrella has driven revenue growth in the mid-20% range and has allowed FIVN to win customers over its main competitors which include Avaya, Genesys and Cisco.This is part of the reason the Q2 results, which we'll detail shortly, were so shocking. FIVN has worked hard to expand its sales force around its growing demand and growing pipeline of interested enterprises recently and this has created a disconnect between existing recurring revenues (which fell and have already been priced into the shares - at least for the reported decay during 1H/14) and new prospect interest in the solution. For clarity, what I'm saying is that there appears to have been a period of time between Q1 reporting and Q2 reporting (most likely at mid-April with FIVN management getting analytics on the slowdown at or around mid-May) in which there was some recurring revenue attrition and some slowing of immediate term closeable interest (which elicited the lowered FY guidance) which would hurt top-line growth in Q3 and Q4 but also a record interest from prospects and new enterprise bookings. This new interest has been largely fueled by growth in overall sales force, at least I'm speculating that has caused the uptick in bookings, and not further interest from existing clients. This theory is based on the drop in recurring revenues presented in the graphic above. For me, this is a concerning trend because of the higher cost per customer acquisition that comes from creating new business rather than expanding existing business (S&M increases, share based comp increases, etc.) and the fact that this could lead to a substantially higher churn rate than what has been the norm. Both of these create operating uncertainties and introduce variables and risk into what has been a great level of consistency.Now, the fact that FIVN's solution, at least it appears for one quarter, became less attractive or was needed in less capacity by existing customers (FIVN customers have the ability to increase or decrease usage of the platform on a ""seat by seat"" basis every 30 days - FIVN is majority compensated based on seat usage) and is obviously what presented the challenging guidance given is definitely something that longs and shorts should be focused on. However, the offsetting record enterprise new customer bookings will matter and FIVN should be seeing the results of this newer revenue growth during FY15. How much growth will come from new enterprise bookings matters greatly to the future of the company and that's what is making Q3 numbers such a binary reporting.So what FIVN investors are faced with trying to analyze is: 1) how much of an effect will the ""slowing"" period have on Q3 and Q4 numbers outside of guidance given (more or less effect?); 2) are the problems structural and here to stay?; 3) if the problems are not structural and are in fact more tethered to ACA (""Obamacare"") will this drop in interest or usage by FIVN's healthcare vertical customers be permanent or eventually revert to prior levels; 4) what indirect effect will the shorter term (assuming it turns out to be shorter term) drop in revenues have on other business needs like refinancing debt, etc.? Again, this level of uncertainty plus the fact that even with a good Q3 showing some currently trapped longs will probably want out or want to risk off a portion of holdings makes FIVN an absolute avoid heading into Q3 numbers. I also think this list of questions and the complete unknown of the answers is what makes the short term short of the shares attractive.According to management, as asked by Richard Davis from Canaccord Genuity on the Q2 conference call, the ACA impact to full year numbers is in the range of $10-$12 million. That's a pretty big impact to come from one variable introduced even if it did hit a large vertical being serviced. I just have a hard time believing, and management provided zero specificity outside of what was directly asked by analyst on the Q2 call, that ACA pressured slowdown in need for FIVN services is causing the entire drop off in guidance. The scary part for longs at this point, and I wish I had a better answer but I don't, is that nobody really knows exactly what all of a sudden is causing the guidance drag outside of the all too convenient ACA excuse given by management. I would love to expand on the list of questions detailed in the previous paragraph but the fact is I have no idea if the drag is structural or not. I have no idea if FIVN's model has made the permanent switch to higher churn being offset by greater size of sales team (implying a continued mid-20% revenue growth but at lower margins because of the higher S&M costs - this isn't good for investors either because it implies a permanent move to lower margins). I know that's essentially the entire purpose of me being a contributor, to answer questions like those detailed, but in the lack of clarity provided by management and in the lack of clarity surrounding the issues by those familiar with the operations and the stock lies the reason for the 25% haircut at Q2 numbers. I just think to speculate one way or the other would be irresponsible at this point. The point of this article isn't to provide best guess answers to the out of trend results reported it's to make the case to avoid a long position and possibly consider a short position prior to and after Q3 reporting. I don't think management will ever give any concrete details as to what forced the lower guidance, even if FIVN does report a poor Q3, so focusing on the causes is probably a lost cause. The proof will be in the pudding of Q3 numbers anyways. If FIVN can reiterate full year guidance or give clarity that doesn't show a structural issue as to the drop, great, shares can move closer to the top end of the range. If management reports a poor Q3, lowers guidance further, and in turn can't provide clarity as to the continued issues and a plan to fix it going forward, the shares should get punished.Speaking of the short position, should Q3 numbers show any of the negative data points reported at Q2 to be continuing I would have to wonder at what cost FIVN is able to refinance debt coming due in 2015. There are pieces of FIVN's debt puzzle that are already expensive by any metric used to measure and the company does have C&CE to cover debt maintenance and operations but actually using cash to pay the debt as currently scheduled would put a significant strain on total cash balance and would put pressure on revenue generation over the next few quarters that doesn't exist currently under the assumption that this debt is moving further down the road. I think this is the primary concern for FIVN holders with a long-term hold in mind, the fact that if a refinance becomes even more expensive as a result of increased risk from lowered growth prospects or the debt is maintained as scheduled from cash either scenario implies greater risk to failure for the company.As I said in the intro, the actual 1H numbers reported weren't all that bad:FIVN did see some positive developments from gross profit, which increased increase an impressive 700 basis points Y/Y from 39% to 46%, and excluding share based comp and D&A expense actually closed the net loss gap Y/Y as well. FIVN also was able to hold R&D expense flat as a percentage of revenue, only show a 400 basis point increase in S&M as a percentage of revenue, and held G&A flat as a percentage of revenue - all positives that would have propped the stock with even a flat guidance. The problem with these developments was guidance wasn't held flat it was dropped and until FIVN becomes profitable and can generate FCF it's going to remain a guidance story.Now, as a final point of note for those considering a position prior to Q3 earnings and one of the bigger concerns I have for the company should Q3 not put investors at ease, the cash flows used in operation at FIVN are beginning to show growth that could start to have FIVN's C&CE balance ""on the clock"":Without any large one-time expenditures from the operations section the increase in cash outflows appears normal and at a level that will remain necessary to operate at the current level of scale up. FIVN management made mention on the Q2 conference call that this run rate was inclusive of some delayed hiring and some other OPEX lever pulling that helped conserve cash. Again, cash is not a short-term concern with what we know today but should those all-important Q3 results come in putting us in a new normal from a revenue generation standpoint and/or the debt maintenance need to be paid from cash it could quickly become one. I don't want to make this a primary worry or point of interest for either the bulls or the bears but this needs noted.Where's the trade?I'm avoiding a long position until after Q3 numbers if ever. I like the idea that FIVN's platform is diverse, has plenty of easy to see value prop to its customers and that the sales force is appearing to have success. I also like that instead of trying to be an all in one solution, at least for right now, that FIVN allows its platform to integrate with CRM systems like Salesforce.com, etc. Prior to Q2 being such a shock I understood why the valuation was where it was.All this being said, FIVN is now in a position where it has to earn back the trust of the market and has to consistently show the market that it is not a high teen revenue growth story. If that's the case the fact that the company planned its expenses around a mid-20% growth rate will become a real problem and maybe one that takes years to sort out. The argument that FIVN could be an easy short after Q3 reporting, even with the chunk that would surely be taken out of share price at the time of reporting, is an easy one to understand.I'm not the type of investor that typically participates in binary situations as I don't mind missing a portion of the move as long as I can catch the move that follows so I'm on the sidelines until at least November 7th.After Q3 numbers are reported I'll be looking for the following developments in an effort to decide if I like FIVN for a long or a short position:…and most importantlyI look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

Management's spending is part of a plan to better target enterprise customers.Five9 has shown the ability to outperform competitors with a great product and sales plan.Contact centers are shifting to the cloud but mostly in the small and mid-sized markets. The enterprise market is shifting some assets but requires a flexible deployment option.Five9 stock's recent 20.7% decline has only made it more fairly priced.Five9 has increased its focus on the enterprise market but lacks a competitive advantage. This strategy will hinder future growth which is needed due to management's current growth strategy.,"Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVN) is a provider of cloud-based contact center solutions. These solutions are used to deploy and manage customer service centers. Five9 has been one of the fastest-growing contact center solutions providers. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 44.2%. This growth has continued into 2014 with revenue growing 21.7% in Q2 and 24.3% for the entire first half. Although second-quarter revenue grew 21.7%, it still fell short of expectations by $18 million. Revenue fell short of expectations but EPS was able to beat estimates by $0.02. Despite solid quarterly earnings, the company's stock fell over 13.6% the day after earnings and has continued to decline a total of 20.7%. The stock's rapid decline is the result of management lowering their full-year guidance. Guidance was lowered from $102-$106 million range down to $99-$101 million. The reason for the lower guidance is weaker demand from healthcare customers.Five9's lower revenue guidance has decreased their potential growth rate from a range of 21.2%-26.0% to 17.7%-20.1%. This slight reduction in growth has caused a significant decline in the stock price. The reason for the rapid stock decline is the company's current profitability issues. From 2009-2013, operating margin has fallen from -5.3% to -33.7%. Operating margin has continued to decline in 2014 reaching -34.4% YTD. Currently, management is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy. The long-term success of this strategy depends on the company's ability to slowly improve profitability over time. This requires a gradual reduction in the growth rate of operating expenses and rapid revenue growth. If the company's growth rate continues to slow, this will severely impact management's ability to improve profitability and the stock price will continue to decline.The company has been able to grow rapidly due to its focus on small to mid-sized corporations. However, management is increasingly focusing on enterprise customers. On the Q2 conference call, Mike Burkland CEO stated, ""Going forward, we remained focused on the following initiatives aimed at accelerating our penetration in the enterprise market."" Enterprise customers have very different concerns, resources, and views toward the cloud than small to mid-sized customers. Five9's competitors are better position and funded to cater to this market segment. Management is determined to target the enterprise customer but these customers require services and solutions which Five9 can't deliver. This enterprise strategy will slow future growth which needs to remain high.Moving To The CloudThe contact center industry is experiencing a shift toward the cloud. In 2008, the adoption rate for cloud-based contact center solutions was 2.2%, according to DMG consulting. Yet in 2013, DMG estimates 62% of companies use some form of cloud-based solutions. Additionally, 45.6% of the remaining non-cloud companies are thinking about moving into the cloud. The contact center industry has experience a tremendous amount of growth in cloud adoption and usage. This growth is expected to continue well into the future. The IDC estimates cloud-based contact center revenue will grow at a CAGR of 17.5%. Additionally, DMG consulting estimates within two years almost every contact center will have some form of cloud-based architecture. Five9 has been able to grow rapidly in this environment due to its strong cloud-based offering and sales effort.Outperforming Current CompetitorsFive9 doesn't only offer customers a cloud-based contact center solution. They also offer a workforce optimization or WFO solution through their partnership with Nice Systems Ltd (NASDAQ:NICE). Nice Systems is the world's leading provider of WFO solutions. Five9's cloud-based solutions along with Nice's market leading WFO solutions has resulted in a competitive advantage against current competitors. Five9's solutions have performed well against both cloud and on premise vendors. Additionally, they have performed exceptionally well against at least one hybrid (on premises and cloud) company. On the Q2 conference call, Mike Burkland talked about competing against one hybrid solutions provider ""...we saw this one particular competitor 11 times during the quarter and we won eight out of those 11."" The company had a 72.7% win rate against this one hybrid competitor. Management has been able to capitalize on this advantage through their internal sales division and external referral program.The referral program originally offered a commission of 5% for each referral. However due to its success, management has decided to raise commissions even more to 15%. This is a strong incentive for Five9 customers and external sales personal to help sell Fire9's products. There referral program along with internal sales and a solid product has help Five9 succeed. Management believes they can translate this success into the enterprise market. Yet, this market segment is completely different than the small and even mid-sized market.Slowly Moving To The Cloud And Needs FlexibilitySmall corporations have severely limited resources which makes large upfront expenditures very difficult. An on-premise contact center has significant upfront costs. Not surprisingly, small corporations have predominately gone without their own contact center. However with the cloud, contact centers have significantly less upfront costs which makes them more affordable. This has resulted in this market segment predominately using cloud-based solutions. Mid-sized corporations don't have the same resource constants as smaller corporations. This is why the mid-sized market is still predominately on premise but is shifting toward the cloud. Mid-sized companies are opting for more of a hybrid solution rather than a fully cloud-based solution. Although most companies want a hybrid solution, there is a sizable portion of companies opting for a complete cloud-based solution.The small corporate market segment offers a great opportunity for cloud-based providers because on premise solution providers don't compete with them. The mid-sized market offers a good opportunity for cloud-based providers but they do face stiffer competition and can't offer a hybrid solution. Hybrid solutions are the main system desired by mid-sized corporations. These two markets offer a sizable opportunity for a solely cloud-based solutions provider. However, the enterprise market is a much more limited market opportunity for a cloud only vendor.The cloud contact center segment is growing fast but is only expected to represent 18% of the contact center industry by 2018. This means the majority of revenue will still come from on premise solutions. The cloud's rapid growth is going to come from small corporations fully migrating to the cloud and a partial move to the cloud by mid-sized and enterprise corporations. The slower migration to the cloud by enterprise customers is due to two main factors. The cloud has several major drawbacks. The cloud reduces a company's ability to control, secure, and integrate a product. These problems have already resulted in company's moving cloud-based solution back in house. IDG Enterprise's survey showed 42% of cloud-based projects were brought back because of concerns over security (66%), oversight/technical problems (47%), and integration stability/reliability (35%). Additionally, enterprise customers have invested millions or even billions in IT personal and infrastructure. These resources add significant value and give the company better control of their operations. Enterprises companies can simply host their own contact center solutions which would result in a private cloud.Some, enterprise companies will move their contact centers to the cloud but this move will be more limited than smaller market segments. This limited migration reduces the potential market size for an exclusively cloud-based vendor. Also, enterprise companies migrating to the cloud still want to remain flexible. This flexibility requires the ability to adjust their cloud and on premise solutions. Five9's lack of an on premise solution puts them at a major disadvantage. Additionally, Frost & Sullivan has noticed a movement away from best of breed solutions to more complete suite offerings. Although Five9 offers an exceptional cloud-based contact center solution, enterprise companies are still opting for the more flexible and complete option. These are factors the industry is dominated by a few vendors.In 2009, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Avaya/Nortel made up 42.6% of the contact center market, according to a Synergy report. The top of the contact center market has since added one more vendor Genesys but now the top controls even more market share. In 2012, the top 3 vendors represented 63.2% of the contact center market. The contact center industry is highly concentrated and requires a significant competitive advantage to gain market share. Yet, Five9 doesn't have a significant competitive advantage in this market segment. Not only does Five9 lack a competitive advantage, they have spent significant resources trying to target this market. On the Q2 conference call, Barry Zwarenstein CFO stated, ""Our sales and marketing expenses have increased as we continue to scale our sales capacity... aimed at enterprise market opportunity."" Five9 increased spending combined with their lack of a competitive advantage will severely impact their long-term profitability and growth.Fairly ValuedUnfortunately, some of the major contact center companies are private (Aspect Software, Inc., Avaya, Inc. and Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc.). This limits the number of comparable companies but below is a good representation of Five9's closest competitors.Data: Yahoo Finance - Key StatisticsInteractive Intelligence and ShoreTel are hybrid contact center vendors. inContact and Five9 are solely cloud-based vendors. Five9 doesn't have any net income due to its rapid expansion plan. This increases the importance of revenue based multiples to establish a relative value. Revenue-based premiums vary greatly based on a company's current growth rate. Comparing each company's growth rate and current multiples will help determine a relative value.*From 2009-2013As seen above, Five9 is still one of the fastest-growing contact center companies. They were only bested by inContact. Due to its superior revenue growth, Five9 should be trading at a significant premium to Interactive Intelligence and ShoreTel. Five9 is selling at a significant premium to both which means the company can't be considered undervalued based on these two companies. Is Five9's stock overvalued? inContact is growing slightly faster than Five9 and has a better profitability situation. This means inContact should be selling at a premium to Five9. inContact is selling at a premium compared to Five9. Five9's stock isn't overvalued based on inContact but isn't undervalued based on Interactive Intelligence and ShoreTel. The stock's recent 20.7% decline has only made it more fairly priced.Focusing On The Wrong Market SegmentFive9 is one of the fastest-growing contact center companies. Management has focused on expanding operations and growing revenue. The company's rapid growth strategy requires maintaining a high level of growth. This is why the slight decline in revenue guidance resulted in such a significant decline in the stock. Management has spent millions to improve their sales and marketing departments. The additional assets are going to be used to better target large enterprise customer. However, the majority of these customers require solutions which Five9 can't supply.The cloud has seen a massive expansion. The cloud is growing rapidly and is expected to continue for many years. Yet, enterprise customers are slowly migrating to the cloud. They have spent millions on IT infrastructure and personal. Unlike the cloud, their internal systems allow for the ability to fully-secure, control, and integrate products. These reasons are why enterprise customers don't want to fully move to the cloud. For enterprise companies moving to the cloud, they want the flexibility to move some solutions to the cloud but be able to keep others on premises. This is why they are increasingly demanding complete suite solutions rather than best of breed. A hybrid solutions provider is well suited for this market segment. Five9 will have a difficult time competing in this highly concentrated and highly competitive environment without a hybrid solution.Management has been significantly increasing sales and marketing assets in order to better target the enterprise market. These expenses are going to have to return a substantial amount of revenue to justify the cost. Yet, Five9 doesn't have a competitive advantage in the enterprise market. Five9's stock declined 20.7% but the decline has only made Five9's stock more fairly valued. Management is pursuing a high-risk growth strategy and targeting a market without a significant competitive advantage. Five9 revenue and stock will have a difficult time rapidly growing with this strategy."

2145073,25120,2014-04-16T14:19:04-04:00,Five9 is a cloud offering in difficult technology and cloud market conditions.Headline growth is slowing down.Five9 continues to burn cash.,"Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) made its public debut on Monday, April 7. Shares of the cloud company, which empowers organizations to create customer engagement centers of excellence through its Virtual Contact Center, rose by 9.1% on their opening day.It is understandable why investors passed on this offering given the slowing revenue growth and mounting losses. These two trends make it easy for me to skip Five9 stock as well.The Public OfferingFive9 has developed the so-called Virtual Contact Center, which allows businesses and organizations to transform older legacy contact centers into better customer engagement centers. This should create better customer service at lower costs through scalable and secure offerings.The company facilitates more than 3 billion interactions between more than 2,000 clients and customers per annum onto its platform. On the platform customer interactions like voice, chat, mail, web and more can be optimized in a real-time fashion.Five9 sold 10 million shares for $7 apiece, thereby raising $70 million in gross proceeds. The proceeds will all go to the company, with no shares being offered by selling shareholders.The offering is a bit disappointing as bankers and firms set an initial price range of $9-$11 per share. Such a price was no longer attainable given the recent correction in the so-called momentum stocks, which include many technology and biotechnology names. As such, underwriters had to adjust the pricing as well, prompting Five9 to sell its shares at a 30% discount.Some 22% of the total shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. At Monday's closing price of $7.36 per share, the firm is valued at $339 million.The major banks that brought the company public were JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Pacific Crest Securities, Canaccord Genuity (OTCPK:CCORF), and Needham & Company.ValuationFive9's VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction to the agent, delivering real-time information, thereby boosting the customer experience as well as the productivity of the agent.These offerings are attractive for customers as they typically require minimum up-front investments while maintenance costs are lowered by the fact that the platform is being run in the cloud. The SaaS business model creates recurring subscriptions, which combined with high retention rates, allow for accurate foreseeable cash flows.For 2013, Five9 generated revenues of $84.1 million, which is up by 31.8% from the year before. Expansion came at a cost, with net losses increasing from $19.3 million in 2012 to $31.3 million over the past year.Before the public offering took place, Five9 operated with $17.7 million in cash and equivalents and $30.3 million in debt. Factoring in gross proceeds of $70 million from the offering, and Five9 will operate with a net cash position of roughly $50 million.Given the current market capitalization of almost $340 million, operating assets are valued at around $290 million. This values operations at 3.5 times annual revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, Five9's offering was quite a disappointment in a difficult public offering market for technology and cloud names. The company priced the offering at $7 per share, some 30% below the midpoint of the preliminary offering range. Ever since, shares have recovered a tiny bit, but trading at $7.36 per share, they are still trading some 26.4% below the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.This should not come as a surprise as Five9 has quite a few challenges ahead. Two of these are the slowing topline revenue growth and continued losses. For starters, revenue growth slowed down from 48% in 2012 to 32% in 2013. As a matter of fact, revenue growth slowed down to 23.7% in the final quarter of the year.While gross margins of 42.0% are solid, the company is already spending a third of its revenues on sales and marketing efforts, while additional research and development expenses, as well as general and administrative costs are pushing the company deep in the red. While losses are stable in relation to revenues, absolute losses keep increasing and the company will burn through its offering proceeds rather quickly at this pace if nothing changes.High compensation expenses to executives is not helpful either to boost sentiment surrounding the offering. The S1-filing reveals that CEO Mike Burkland took home a total compensation package of $2.3 million over the past year, nearly 3% of total revenues.As such, I have more than enough reasons to pass on this offering.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

3745296,48411,2015-12-09T15:05:13-05:00,FSNN is out with big news regarding an accretive acquisition.With this acquisition FSNN addresses many of the bear thesis bullet points I believe were creating buyer reluctance.Look for FSNN to move higher in the coming quarter on momentum sustained from this announcement.,"Fusion Telecom (OTC:FSNN), a name I've followed for a while now but a name in which I've never written about and hold no position in, is out with meaningful news of an accretive acquisition. This is most readily apparent in recent share price appreciation. Shares have traded as much as 75% higher on the news.The acquisition news, it should also be noted, is being uniformly praised by those whom I've asked to review. I actually believe this acquisition is bigger than even the recent share price appreciation indicates and that this acquisition puts Fusion, finally, in the conversation for ownership. For the longest time, despite some of my professional resources being long the stock, I've been forced to hold placement for Fusion on the sidelines. I don't think that's the case any longer. I'll explain.First, for those unfamiliar with this microcap, Fusion is a ""provider of unified communications & cloud services, mainly IP-based digital voice and data communications services to small and medium sized businesses and other telecommunications carriers (via SEC.gov)"". Essentially, Fusion brings professional communication management services and capacity to SMB's that might otherwise not have them or be relying on lesser/point-solution provided capacity. Think of Fusion as a cousin of the traditional SMB software productivity suite.Fusion has been able to scale its business, via a combination of organic and acquired growth, to a healthy ~$100 million in TTM revenues and a healthy near-breakeven cash flow. Both I think it goes without saying are definitively positive - especially in the always iffy microcap space. In addition to this, Fusion has real bank lending access via a credit facility that has both a revolver and a senior loan capacity, Fusion has a non-toxic cap structure, Fusion has committed major shareholders (including the sitting CEO), and Fusion has significant NOL's (which I'm always position on). So, in short, we're talking about a real company. That said, I have never had a position in the name and had little real intentions of taking one. Until, that is, the company did something like it did as detailed in the acquisition press release.The big issues that I had with Fusion leading into the acquisition announcement, which I promise I'm about to breakout, were that Fusion's revenue growth was slowing on an organic basis and that Fusion was ""transitioning"" its core competency from a balanced, two-segment approach to a more focused, one-segment approach. Why was it doing the latter? Because one of its segments is being completely commoditized and is seeing significant upticks to competition. Fusion being well-ran has decided to be proactive instead, focusing on what it does well and what it can do profitability. In very impressive fashion, Fusion has been able to hold its gross margins relatively flat throughout the process. Still, on the whole Fusion hasn't seen much from organic growth TTM and that was something that didn't sit well with me. Fusion has addressed this, or at least started, with its recent acquisition.Fusion announced that it has acquired Fidelity Voice and Data, another cloud voice, cloud connectivity, security, data center and cloud storage service provider, for a total consideration of $30 million. Now, that might seem like a hefty price tag at first glance at Fusions market cap - which sits at a gross ~$20 million. But, again, the tag seems exponentially smaller when comparing the consideration to the TTM revenues - which near ~$100 million. What does Fusion get from Fidelity that it was willing to deploy so much capital for? The answer is ""a lot"".First, Fusion acquires Fidelity's tech. That matters. Fusion now has a deeper roster of technology, gets slightly more vertical, and has fully ""integrated"" talent that comes on board with a deep familiarity with the tech. That matters too.Second, Fusion acquires accretive drop down for its financials. This is being led by Fidelity's ~$18 million per year revenue generation which it should be noted is 90% monthly recurring. Fidelity's revenue base breaks out to roughly $750 per month per customer which has an impressive low-churn rate of just one half of one percent per month. For an IaaS business that's, at least in my opinion, trying to blend into a SaaS that low churn rate and high ARPCustomer is huge. Really, really huge. From a financial standpoint, Fusion also picks up an estimated $6 million in Adjusted EBITDA when projecting in ""expected synergies"".As a quick sidebar I'd like to project that after integration is completed that I think that number (ARPCustomer) - if backed out between Fusion and Fidelity - grows significantly based on Fusion's operating prowess being overlayed onto the Fidelity model. We'll have to see if that proves out as true but that's my guess. To be clear, I don't view the accretive drop down on the income statement as an ""end all, be all"" of this deal - as Fusion is generating ""healthy"" net losses via a large D&A drop down - but it helps that Fidelity isn't outlined in the acquisition PR as significantly burning cash or operating at a loose net loss. Again, I like that Fusion is cash flow breakeven but still generating a GAAP-net loss on the income statement. That should keep the company from being a cash tax paying entity for quite some time ahead.Third, and maybe most importantly, Fusion adds ~2000 SMB's to its customer base. My biggest concern far and away prior to this acquisition was the lack of organic growth. My guess is that the customer base expansion along with the tech product portfolio expansion/optimization will help out with that in a big way. I also think that a focus of selling back into the customer base, which was indicated as a goal within the announcement PR, might provide a mid-term bump to gross margin. Presumably, these sales will come at a lower CAC and at a higher ARPCustomer in that Fidelity brings some up-sell capacity. Stay tuned for updates on if this proves out. Still, the fact that organic growth is now at least presumably at hand is positive.All told, I think this acquisition attacked my fears for Fusion head on. Fusion gets a little bigger, it gets more efficient, it picks up some organic growth (existing via Fidelity) and organic growth potential, it acquires more product capacity and spectrum, and it was able to lower its blended cost of debt in the process (from 11.2% to 8% via tapping a newly established credit facility). I really like this move and I would agree with those out opining on how well this positions the company for 2016. I'm looking to get in touch with management and will report my findings back to readers here.Good luck everybody.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2309375,48781,2014-07-11T16:39:26-04:00,"The ongoing transition towards cloud services has been unfairly discounted as it has been largely driven by acquisitions.
        However, this is more than reflected in the low normalized EBITDA multiple, which is a fraction of the peer group and recent industry deal comps.
        In business services, the large customer base generates a growing stream of high margin (>60% GM is ~5.3x higher than carrier services) and recurring revenue (>90%; multi-year contracts).
        Fusion should be able to capture a meaningful portion of the increasing cloud spending (and accelerate organic growth) through higher quality customer acquisition, cross/up selling opportunities and verticalization.
        The turnaround in carrier services should be driven by continued gross margin expansion, operational synergies with business services, greater volume capacity and new customer acquisition.","Company overviewFusion Telecommunications International (OTC:FSNN) provides cloud solutions through the business services segment and voice traffic termination services (primarily VoIP in emerging markets) to >270 carriers through the carrier services segment. In 2009, FSNN sold its consumer services business to focus exclusively on these two segments.Two strategic acquisitions catapulted FSNN into the cloudThe past two years were transformative due to the acquisitions of Network Billing Systems (NBS) and the Broadvox cloud services business, which enabled FSNN to accomplish the critical first part of its growth strategy that consists of M&A, organic growth and verticalization.In October 2012, FSNN acquired NBS (a provider of cloud communications and connectivity services) for $19.6 million and only 4x EBITDA. This acquisition was fully integrated in only 120 days and produced $2 million of synergies. Moreover, ~95% of revenue is recurring (and paid monthly) while the gross margin is 50%.In December 2013, FSNN acquired the cloud services business of Broadvox for $32.1 million and only 5x EBITDA. This acquisition was just as attractive as NBS as evident by the multiple similarities including $2.7 million of synergies (only half realized so far with the remainder over the next 12-24 months), extremely high recurring revenue (93%) and gross margin (65%).This combined growth platform and experience with integration (in addition to the existing deep bench of C-suite executives with roll-up acquisition experience) can be applied going forward as FSNN helps consolidate the fragmented industry. This should result in minimal business interruption, greater synergies and a classic ""whole is greater than the sum of the parts"" scenario.Increasing cloud spending helps ease growth transition from acquisition-led to organicThe concurrent slowdown in the M&A cadence and focus on organic growth should sufficiently reassure investors that growth is both real and sustainable (driven by the cloud) rather than ""manufactured"" and temporary (debt-fueled acquisitions). While the cloud story may already be well-known, this knowledge is only as powerful as the asymmetric investment ideas it generates. The focus on more visible cloud names such as Salesforce.com or recent IPOs (Zendesk, MobileIron and Arista Networks) provides an opportunity as investors overlook microcap companies trading at more attractive valuations poised to benefit from the same underlying growth driver.Although the factors driving this trend are important (e.g. allows for a greater focus on the core business, increased productivity, no upfront capex/pay as you go, reduced IT requirements, seamless updates), a more in-depth discussion of the quantifiable market opportunity and company-specific fundamentals will be more constructive. Gartner expects the global cloud services market to grow from $155 billion to $244 billion in 2017. Communications and IT are two of the fastest growing areas within cloud services with a projected CAGR of 39.3% through 2018, which FSNN should be able to capitalize on after its cloud unified communications service was named the Communications Solutions Product of the Year in June 2014.Although cloud providers in general should steal market share from legacy telecoms unable to compete with newer technologies, FSNN should be able to steal market share from other cloud providers with its highly scalable and carrier-grade network, holistic cloud-based solution (communications, connectivity, storage, security) and national footprint compared to most cloud providers that only offer a limited product line and regional geographic coverage.Not only should this attract higher quality customers (resulting in higher ARPU and lower churn) but it provides the opportunity to generate additional revenue and increase contract stickiness through cross/up selling new cloud services that can be rapidly deployed through its proprietary platform. A large portion of incremental revenue should fall to the bottom line due to the extremely high operating leverage, low recurring costs (e.g. zero licensing fees due to the use of in-house programmers; recent platform upgrade to provide greater efficiencies) and ~$132.7 million of NOLs.This scale enables FSNN to execute on the third part of its growth strategy by providing specialized solutions to underpenetrated verticals (e.g. healthcare, legal, hospitality and real estate) and expanding beyond the core small/medium enterprise customer to larger enterprise customers, which should be attracted to the new infrastructure-as-a-service platform.An exclusive agreement in January 2012 to offer a full range of cloud services to the 15,000 national members of the Greater New York Hospital Association provides the leverage to expand into one of the largest and fastest growing verticals. Healthcare telecommunications spending is projected to increase from $9.1 billion in 2012 to $14.4 billion in 2017 including $5.4 billion dedicated to the cloud. A strategic partnership with Unisys to market secure (HIPAA-compliant and NSA-certified) cloud services provides a competitive advantage and should alleviate fears of data security.A more recent example (from May 2013) is the integration of its cloud communications platform with the Gryphon Core Phone Do Not Call application (the only real-time and cloud-based Do Not Call solution) to be used in the financial industry. There should be increasing demand for this solution as it represents ""low hanging fruit"" (especially for large wealth management divisions at banks such as Morgan Stanley) in terms of cutting costs and boosting margins*.*Reducing advisor comp is counter-productive as the top producers simply leave for greener pastures (another wirehouse or go to the independent channel).Recent quarterly results highlight increasing revenue/EBITDA run rateAlthough y-y comparisons are less meaningful due to the Broadvox acquisition, this does not mean the revenue/EBITDA growth and gross margin expansion in 1Q14 (as shown in the bullet points below) should be ignored or even discounted.A longer term view that includes the NBS acquisition is required in order to fully appreciate the transformation.Investment risksThe long history of operating/net losses, negative operating cash flow and working capital deficit is less of a concern given the recent reversal. In 1Q14, FSNN ended years of operating losses by posting a profit of $289,000. The net losses are less meaningful due to the extreme volatility as a result of fluctuations in the fair value of the warrants. For example, an increase in the stock price results in a higher warrant valuation and a charge to net income while a decrease has the opposite effect.Although operating cash flow is still negative, the current burn rate of $2.7 million (LTM) is down 21% from 2012. Management expects to be cash flow positive following the integration of Broadvox, which reduces the need for any future equity issuance.The cash raised from a $44 million debt/equity issuance in 2013 (largely to fund the Broadvox acquisition) should be sufficient to fund working capital (which improved from a $12 million deficit in 2011 to a surplus of $6.3 million in 1Q14) in the short term until FSNN becomes cash flow positive. The high level of monthly recurring revenue and variable cost structure further reduce working capital requirements. In 2013, working capital received an additional boost after FSNN determined that it no longer had liability for a $2.9 million trade payable.The increasing level of competition in the cloud space (especially from larger companies desperate to remain relevant and more specialized providers) is expected to result in pricing pressure although the effect on FSNN should be muted given the previously mentioned competitive advantages.In 2013, one customer accounted for >10% of revenue, which is an improvement from 2012 when two customers accounted for 37%.The acquisitions of Broadvox and NBS were largely funded by relatively high interest rate debt (~11%; overall debt increased >8x from 2011). This risk is mitigated by the expected increase in cash flow and several years until the first maturity is due. FSNN should have received an additional $2 million of cash in 2Q14 as funds held in escrow are released following the receipt of regulatory approvals.Performance in carrier services is lagging business services as revenue decreased 18% in 1Q14 due to lower rates for voice termination traffic, which is part of an ongoing trend as a result of deregulation, increased competition and the use of internet-based technologies. However, this has been offset by gross margin expansion (up 360 bps to 11.8%), which could expand further as a higher portion of termination capacity is used to carry traffic generated by higher margin business services customers while the variable cost structure preserves gross margins in the event of a revenue decrease.On the revenue side, the following two factors should result in a resumption of growth. First, the ongoing expansion of capacity on its network switching platform provides the ability to handle increased traffic volumes beginning in 2H14. Second, plans to begin marketing to cable television providers, internet search engine companies and IP phone companies should provide stable and higher margin revenue compared to its core traditional carrier customers.The large amount of goodwill from the two acquisitions results in a negative tangible book value. However, book value is not the appropriate valuation metric even for slower growing tech companies (such as IBM), much less for companies with a growth trajectory such as FSNN. As a result, the more meaningful metric to watch is earnings (or EBITDA in this case).The negative reaction by some investors to the 1-for-50 reverse split in May 2014 is unwarranted as the assumed reason for the split is to compensate for deteriorating fundamentals. However, this is clearly not the case with FSNN (in fact the opposite as the bullish case is only getting stronger). This effective ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"" response provides an opportunity as it (by definition) fails to consider a company on its individual merits. Moreover, this split was instrumental in the subsequent uplisting to NASDAQ in June 2014, which should result in improved liquidity and visibility.Valuation and target priceAlthough FSNN trades at a significant discount to its peer group (as shown in the chart below), the valuation is even more compelling when using a more appropriate run rate. On a LQA basis, the EBITDA multiple drops by more than half to 7.2x and the revenue multiple drops to 1x.The ongoing industry M&A activity at high double-digit multiples provides further valuation support. Last month, Oracle paid 17x EBITDA for Micros Systems (a provider of cloud-based solutions to the retail and hospitality industries), which is ~5x turns lower than the median multiple of 22x for internet/software acquisitions, according to Bloomberg.FSNN clearly deserves a higher multiple as the large business services customer base provides a growing stream of high margin (gross margin >60%; EBITDA margin of 15-20%) and recurring revenue (>90%; multi-year contracts). Not only is this exactly the type of business that LBO dreams are made of but the multiple is 4x turns lower than the median LBO multiple of 11.5x (PDF alert) - and many of these acquired companies are not nearly as attractive as FSNN.As a result, the target price of ~$7.40 (~43% gain) is derived by placing a 10x multiple on LQA EBITDA of $12.3 million. This is conservative due to the discount to the closest peer group (and overall cloud peer group) and the fact that it assumes zero EBITDA growth even though management projects that revenue and gross profit in business services will ""increase significantly in 2014"".Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3021166,80826,2015-03-24T11:49:44-04:00,Cloud services is a large and growing market.Fusion is a compelling value opportunity in a growth industry.Stable revenue base and acquisition strategy lead to continued solid EBITDA growth.Liquidity issues need to be overcome for Fusion to achieve peers' valuations.,"Ask 10 investors what comes to mind when they think of ""the cloud"" and you're likely to get 20 different responses. Indeed, the notion of what cloud services are, precisely, is evolving rapidly across the entire IT landscape. Companies like Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have expanded far beyond their traditional service offerings and are now playing in multiple segments of the cloud services market, which research firm IDC expects to reach $200 billion by 2018.Not surprisingly, investors are drawn to cloud services stocks by the luster of superior growth opportunities driven by the disruption of the traditional IT and software value chain. This is reflected in the tremendous value creation - and outsized share price performance - by many cloud services companies including Rackspace and Salesforce over the last several years.These and other cloud services stocks are seeing valuations generally in the range of 3x to 5x on the basis of enterprise value to 2014 revenues. On an enterprise value to cash flow basis the multiples are wider but quite high as well, from Rackspace at around 13x 2014 Ebitda to 8x8, Inc. (NYSE:EGHT) at nearly 30x.One cloud services stock that offers a far more attractive valuation is Fusion (OTC:FSNN). By my estimation, the shares - which recently traded just under $4.00 - are remarkably inexpensive against any metric and trade at a fraction of its peers' multiples. Using enterprise value and annualizing Fusion's past nine months' financial performance, the stock is valued at a paltry 0.75x revenues and just 7x EBITDA.This disconnect is in contrast to the company's strong financial and operational performance over the past year and its significant growth potential. As a low-priced stock with relatively limited trading volume, Fusion hasn't hit the big institutional investors' screens yet - creating an opportunity for smaller investors and traders.Over the past several quarters, Fusion has quietly become a leading provider of cloud services to medium and large businesses as well as multinational enterprises. It boasts over 11,000 business customers, including the country's largest hospitals, law firms, airlines, insurers and commercial real estate firms, which have trusted Fusion to manage their move into the cloud. Given the sticky, high value nature of the services it provides to this impressive customer base, Fusion's average revenue per customer is nearly $700 per month - 2x to 3x greater than that of its peers. These services also produce a highly predictable sales model, with over 90% of Fusion's business revenues contracted and recurring.One compelling aspect of Fusion is its exposure to the growing trend of companies migrating their IT infrastructure from on-site to the cloud, which fundamentally transforms the way people work. By leveraging the cloud, companies of all sizes can dramatically reduce their IT costs and infrastructure requirements using pay-as-you-grow services that provide better insights and visibility into performance. Most importantly, the cloud frees management teams to focus on their core businesses by removing the burden of legacy IT systems.I believe Fusion is ideally positioned to capitalize on massive opportunities in the cloud services market for several reasons. Most importantly, Fusion provides an entire portfolio of integrated cloud solutions for small and medium size businesses as well as enterprises. Its offerings include cloud voice, connectivity, computing, storage and security. Companies need only make one call to Fusion to take their business into the cloud, whereas other providers only offer one or two products, forcing companies to look to several vendors to build a full cloud solution.A big source of this competitive differentiation is Fusion's own secure and scalable nation-wide network that provides robust connectivity to the cloud - something that is of critical importance to medium-sized businesses as well as larger enterprises.Another reason I'm attracted to Fusion is its Fortune 500-quality management, Board of Directors and Advisory Board that allows the company to punch well above its weight. Having met, and spoken with, CEO Matthew Rosen multiple times, I have found him to be a compelling leader for such a small company. He has personally, and I love to see this, invested heavily in the business to date and leads a strong team with significant experience in building and managing companies with scale. Fusion's Board and Advisors roster is made up of a strong group of distinguished leaders in business and the public sector, including former Verizon (NYSE:VZ) CFO Fred Salerno, former NYNEX Chairman Paul O'Brien and former three-term New Hampshire Governor John Sununu.While I am often wary of investing in ""show me"" businesses with a limited track record, Fusion's management has demonstrated impressive execution in recent years. The company has acquired and integrated three cloud services companies since 2012 in highly accretive transactions. These acquisitions along with organic growth have led to a greater than 50% increase in sales, to $69 million during the first nine months of 2014 versus the first nine months of 2013. Even more remarkably, adjusted Ebitda has grown nearly five-fold to $8.5 million over the same period.In consideration of this strong performance - and the remarkable turnaround it represents - the company up-listed to Nasdaq last May. We believe this makes the shares even more attractive to long-term, growth-oriented shareholders.Looking ahead, there are plenty of opportunities for Fusion to grow organically, including strengthening its direct and indirect sales efforts and moving aggressively into new, multi-billion-dollar customer verticals like Healthcare IT. With its impressive enterprise customer base, broad geographic reach, and full suite of cloud services, Fusion can successfully sell much deeper and wider than it has in the past.Equally, if not more, compelling is the company's acquisition strategy. Building on the success of recent deals, I expect Fusion to continue pursuing accretive transactions in the cloud services sector, targeting similar and complementary businesses alike across this highly fragmented landscape. Management has shown good discipline in its three acquisitions to date, focusing on companies with high-value customers, recurring revenue streams, and strong cash flows that it can buy at attractive prices. Just as importantly, Fusion has shown an ability to tightly integrate acquisitions quickly and successfully.Analyst commentary on Fusion, while somewhat limited, has been bullish, focusing on the large and rapidly growing cloud services market opportunity, the company's unique end-to-end cloud services strategy, its track record of execution, and strong leadership. Based on these attributes, the company's growth prospects and other factors, H.C. Wainwright's Kevin Dede has a Buy rating and $6 price target for the stock, while Vista Partners' Ross Silver is even more optimistic with a $9.50 target.All this brings us back to the obvious paradox of Fusion's current stock price. Despite the growth and execution of late, the valuation remains grounded. As stated earlier, Fusion is a ""show-me"" stock and several things need to occur for the shares to take off.First off, the company needs to continue to focus and execute on its strategy. It has taken a long time for the company to get to where they stand and, frankly, the company probably went public too early in its development and suffers from this. Also, a couple more acquisitions that demonstrate the consolidation potential, at accretive multiples, will be positive.However, the shares' relative lack of liquidity is most likely to blame for Fusion's low profile and cheap valuation; it certainly makes it harder for large institutions to participate. While this has kept the stock off institutional investors' radar screens so far, this likely won't be the case for long. I believe that Fusion shares should be acquired now by investors willing to be patient through the next couple quarters. Because, with continued growth and execution, Fusion should reward investors handsomely as it grows into a company large and liquid enough to deserve the high multiples of other cloud services companies.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

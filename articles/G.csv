4329435,104225,2020-03-04T08:52:36-05:00,Genpact is a BPO and IT service provider with global operations and a focus on its chosen verticals.The company has been on a re-brand path as a digital transformation partner for its clients vs. a legacy outsourced service provider.The service industry is going through a transformation and companies that lead the path on digital re-branding will be well positioned in the future.We believe Genpact is positioned well to tap into the massive digital transformation services market and is valued favorably compared to its peers.We see future upside for the stock and recommend that investors establish a long position.,"Genpact (G) is a Business Process Outsourcing (""BPO"") and IT service provider which has recently been in the midst of a digital re-brand. The company has steadily expanded its operations around the globe over the past decade and is considered a leader in its verticals of focus. We believe that the company is well positioned to tap into the massive digital transformation market with several growth prospects at its disposal. The stock price is quite attractive following the recent coronavirus led market impact. Based on fundamentals, the stock compared quite well to peers and we recommend that investors with a long time horizon should look to establish a long position based on today's valuation. In this article, we take an in-depth look at the company, its products and the market it operates in. We are of the view that B2B businesses, especially in the service industry are not well understood by general investors which leads these investments to be unjustifiably disregarded at times. Therefore, we have presented a fairly comprehensive view of the company and the industry as part of our thesis.Genpact began in 1997 as a unit within General Electric (GE). Its purpose was to provide business process services to GE's businesses. Over time, the company started providing these services to external clients and today generates ~85% of its revenue from non-GE clients. The company was spun off in 2007 and is listed on the NYSE; Bain Capital invested in Genpact in 2012 and is currently the firm's largest shareholder.Products and ServicesThe company essentially provides two broad services; BPO and IT services. These are fairly standard terms in the service industry and cover a wide variety of tasks under them. Within BPO (84% of revenue), Genpact mostly provides back office and transformation services:Within IT services (16% of revenue):Both service types are further divided within digital and traditional services. It is not entirely clear which services Genpact classifies as digital however the company has emphasized its expertise in digital services in the recent past as such capabilities generally command a higher valuation in the market. Generally within the industry, legacy firms have acquired these capabilities via M&A and Genpact has invested significant capital on acquisition activity to buy capabilities such as RPA, consulting, AI and insurance specific digital services (as this is a large vertical served by the company - to be covered later in the article). The company also has some proprietary solutions which are being used in digital transformation projects.Source: Genpact investor presentationWhat is Digital?At this point, it is pertinent to discuss what exactly it means to provide digital services as this is the prevailing theme within the service industry. Digital is possibly the biggest buzzword in the service industry and the definition of what constitutes digital varies from company to company and even within industry analysts. All service companies are essentially trying to re-brand themselves as more ""digital"" as customers look to transform legacy processes and introduce a higher level of automation and use technology to gain efficiencies, reduce costs, generate additional revenue and improve customer experience. This is in contrast to traditional services which involve lower value talent and are under threat of automation and cost pressures as competition increases.By way of an example, to demonstrate the wide variety of digital services in just one process transformation, consider how a sizable number of Starbucks customers in busy office buildings now order via the Starbucks app and pick up their coffee vs. waiting in the line to order manually. Transforming this process requires more than simply developing an app and launching it. The company needs to understand customer preferences, develop an easy to use interface, develop a new process around how customers will actually pick up the coffee, how the baristas will get the order and prioritize it etc. The types of skills required to map the customer journey and identify pain points (consulting), develop the app interface (UX/UI design), develop the app (developers/coders) and maintain the app/underlying infrastructure (IT management) vary significantly and may give you an idea of why digital services have such a broad definition. There is a general perception in the market that given the demand for digital transformation by customers, revenue from these services should be growing faster than traditional services. The issue, as mentioned earlier, is that there is no agreed upon definition of digital as services that may not immediately appear to be ""digital"" may still have a significant demand/growth rate associated with them. As an example, providing customer service over chat and social media platforms is in high demand as end users gravitate to these channels vs. voice based service. Does an outsourced agent in the Philippines answering queries over Facebook constitute a digital service? Many service companies providing chat support may classify this revenue as digital and although there is significant demand/growth for these services, the moat around providing these services may not be as wide given they are easy to replicate (i.e. companies don't need to hire very high value talent to provide chat support). The point here is that investors need to base their investment decision in service companies beyond just looking at the ""% of digital revenue"" and need to assess the ""digital-ness"" of the company's capabilities.CustomersThis is a B2B business with large individual contracts, therefore customer verticals and overall client concentration are key metrics that the market looks at to assess growth prospects and risk. Genpact places a high amount of focus on vertical specific capabilities and has looked to move up the value chain within its verticals of focus. The company's disclosure of key verticals is extremely vague with some odd groupings such as ""Hi-Tech, Manufacturing and Services"". This classification really doesn't tell investors much as all three segments in this description vary quite significantly. We conducted further research with the aim to narrow these down and based on Everest Group's PEAK matrix assessment, we believe that Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) and manufacturing verticals hold a significant amount of revenue followed by healthcare and retail. Historically, BFSI has been a key vertical of focus especially insurance companies which is evident by the insurance specific capabilities acquired by the company via M&A.Genpact customer verticals; Source: company disclosuresIn terms of client concentration, top 10 clients consist of ~32% of revenue (2018 figures; 2019 annual report hasn't been filed yet). This is generally quite good compared to industry standards and indicates a diversified client base. This is especially impressive given that these figures include GE which is likely one of the largest clients. We believe GE's business is quite sticky given the relationship between the two companies.Genpact client concentration; Source: company disclosuresGeographical Footprint and OperationsAs of December 31, 2019, the company reported an average headcount of ~91,000. This is a big number which obviously indicates the labor intensive nature of the services provided by the company. A metric that shows quality of service and employee engagement levels is the annual attrition rate of employees. For Genpact, this rate sits at ~28% which is quite good compared to industry standards of 40% - 50%. Hiring and training vast number of employees is a significant cost in this industry and clients don't generally pay for training and ramp-up costs, therefore retaining headcount is important.Another key metric in this industry is scale and diversity of operations. This is important as there are obvious unit cost benefits of scale. Additionally, there is currently a trend within large clients to consolidate their vendors and therefore providers that can provide services from multiple locations are preferred. Large multi-national clients also require multiple languages to support their diverse customer base hence scale is an important factor in their buying decision. Genpact has delivery locations in 16 countries out of 70 delivery centers, offering support in 30 languages. Although the company doesn't provide exact size of operations within each country, their website lists 13 delivery centers in India and given the company's roots, we believe this is where a vast majority of their headcount sits. The company also lists 17 centers in the USSummary of Key Non-Financial MetricsMarket Size and Key TrendsThe global BPO market is sized at ~$200B and can be divided into a few broad categories:The overall market is expect to grow ~8% - 9% CAGR until 2026 however the growth rates can vary significantly based on the type of service, geography and vertical. For example, within customer services, the demand for chat support is significantly higher than voice support. Generally, there is a need for providers to strengthen higher value capabilities and provide end-to-end support for these processes including design, build and maintain/operate. The design and build parts of this equation are generally where the digital transformation work is involved (we will talk about the market for this work below).Relative market growth rates by service type: Source: AmeriresearchThe need to provide higher value and end-to-end services emanates from the following two prevailing trends that are impacting the industry at a macro level:The market size for digital transformation services is valued at ~$260B and is expected to grow at an 18% CAGR which is significantly higher than the growth rate for the BPO market. It is no surprise then that traditional BPO players are looking to tap into this market to enhance their growth vectors.The Role of M&AAs discussed, the market for these services has become extremely fragmented over the years which has led to a substantial amount of consolidation. Larger players have also engaged in M&A lately to acquire digital capabilities and customers within targeted verticals. In fact almost all large traditional BPO players have acquired digital capabilities via M&A in an effort to re-brand themselves and Genpact is no exception to this.Genpact M&A criteria; Source: Investor presentationGenpact recent M&A transactions; Source: Company disclosuresCompetition AnalysisGiven the wide variety of services offered by Genpact and the fragmented nature of the BPO industry, it is no surprise that the company has many competitors. To get a sense of the number of competitors, let's look at the list below which shows the company's competitive positioning on Everest Group's assessments in many different service areas in which Genpact plays.Source: Genpact websiteFor the purposes of this article, let's focus on large public competitors as data is readily available for these types of companies. We have grouped these companies into broad categories based on a high level view of services provided. As we can see, Genpact is positioned quite favorably on key operating metrics as it has a higher than average EBIT % compared to its BPO peer group and is a leader when it comes to revenue growth. In fact, we believe that based on the steps taken by the company to re-brand itself and strengthen key capabilities within its verticals of focus, Genpact is a candidate to trade up to a valuation multiple which is closer to the Offshore/Nearshore IT services group which is viewed more capable of providing digital transformation services.Source: CapitalIQFinancial PerformanceThe results of the company's transformation efforts along with M&A can be seen in the financial results. From 2016 onwards, the company has continuously accelerated their YoY revenue growth with a significant increase in F2019. 40% of the 2019 growth did come from expansion of services to GE however as mentioned above, Genpact will always be the preferred vendor for GE and although we don't view GE's prospects all that positively, there should still be sufficient work for Genpact. 50% of the 2019 growth likely came from external clients and the remaining 10% from ramp-up of acquisitions which were completed in late 2018. Genpact has mentioned that the growth acceleration is due to demand for digital transformation services from clients and due to strengthening of end-to-end capabilities that the company can provide its clients in verticals of focus. Compared to competitor growth rates listed in the section above, Genpact's performance is relatively superior. The overall margins are also quite healthy at ~16% EBITDA which is near the average in this industry. We believe that as the company increases the mix of transformation services which is considered higher value work, there could be opportunities for margin expansion.Another key metric to assess is the company's leverage. The company currently has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.9x which is slightly higher than the average for peers. Given the recent M&A activity, this ratio is justified and the company has healthy cash generation which should allow it to pay back the debt over time without any foreseeable hiccups.ValuationWe believe the company is valued quite favorably (from investor's point of view) compared to its competitors. The company has successfully re-branded itself as a digital transformation partner which should see its valuation multiple move closer to the offshore/nearshore IT services group listed in our table above (see competitor analysis section above). The company's stock price is down ~14% after the recent coronavirus impact on markets however we don't believe there should be an outsized impact on Genpact's business relative to other businesses in the event the virus spreads. It's obviously still too early to gauge the full impact of the coronavirus however based on fundamentals, we believe the stock represents a sound investment. We set a price target of $47 based on 25x LTM EBIT.Genpact has strong roots within its verticals of focus and has successfully re-branded itself as a digital service provider over recent years. The company has reduced its reliance on GE which is a positive and has accelerated revenue growth while maintaining its margins. The company has several growth vectors at its disposal and given the recent coronavirus market impact, we believe investors with long time horizons should look to establish a long position."

        The business process management services provider is targeting strong adjusted earnings per share growth for 2016 and maintains a very healthy balance sheet.
        Let's have a look at its investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for its equity.","By The Valuentum TeamA lot has changed at Genpact (NYSE:G) that past few years. Since 2007, the company has grown into a firm with ~$2.5 billion in annual revenue from ~$820 million, as its client base has expanded to more than 700 from 150 over the same time. Clients with hefty revenue-generating capacity ($5+ million annually) have increased to north of 100 from under 20 in the past decade, while adjusted earnings per share has expanded considerably as well, to $1.25+ from ~$0.50. Genpact has been doing a lot of things right, to say the least.For those that aren't familiar with the firm, Genpact is a leader in digitally-powered business process management services and serves one-fifth of the Fortune Global 500 as clients. It performs a lot of duties, from managing client invoices to monitoring assets to managing devices to analyzing transactions for its customers. Word-of-mouth continues to be the driving engine behind the company's ongoing growth potential, and management is correct when they say that ""clients act as (its) ambassadors."" It monitors its ""net promoter score"" religiously and views it as a way of life.This year is looking like another good one for Genpact, as it meets the needs of customers across a variety of industries where ""disruption is the new normal."" Lean digital initiatives have expanded the work that Genpact does, and we think it will set the stage for resilient revenue and earnings growth in coming years. Management is targeting earnings per share north of $1.40 in 2016, putting the company at 18 times earnings on expected constant-currency growth of 8%-10% for the year. Genpact is an asset-light business that throws off considerable free cash flow ($200+ million in each of the past 5 years). Leverage remains less than 1x (net debt/EBITDA), too.In light of Genpact's consistent revenue growth and strong cash-flow generation, we think it's certainly one for the radar. We'll be watching shares closely, as its valuation is still a bit on the high side. Nonetheless, a fantastic company it is.Genpact's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Genpact is a global leader in business process management and information technology services worldwide. It offers a wide range of finance and accounting services. The firm traces its origins back to the internal business process services operation for GE Capital in 1997. It is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.• The firm plays in a large and growing under-penetrated market, which management estimates at $390 billion. Increasing penetration of its focus verticals will provide additional avenues for expansion.• Genpact has experienced solid bookings momentum in recent quarters, advancing ~20% year-over-year in 2015, which has helped the firm develop a healthy pipeline. Win rates continue to hold at high levels, and recent investment in its sales force has resulted in material sales productivity gains. Bookings trends are worth watching closely.• As with many of its peers, its clients' needs are rapidly-changing, and this spells opportunity for the firm. Genpact has a strong, highly reference-able set of relationships with global blue-chip clients. Roughly 80% of its growth comes from existing clients, and repeat business will continue to be a key profit driver.• Genpact is expecting strong top and bottom line growth in 2016, and cash flow from operations is anticipated to grow 6%-8% from 2015. This, coupled with ~3% of revenue being allocated to capital expenditures, should drive free cash flow growth.Economic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Genpact's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 46.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Genpact's free cash flow margin has averaged about 10.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Genpact, cash flow from operations increased about 5% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 27% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Genpact is worth $24 per share with a fair value range of $19-$29.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 16.7%, which is above Genpact's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Genpact, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $24 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Genpact. We think the firm is attractive below $19 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $29 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Genpact's fair value at this point in time to be about $24 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Genpact's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $33 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $24 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

4005540,85096,2016-09-12T05:40:04-04:00,"Genpact Ltd. total return over performed the Dow for the 44.0 month test period by 22.51%.
        Genpact Ltd. is growing its business in information technology with over 800 clients worldwide and has 70,000 employees.
        Genpact Ltd. does not pay a dividend but earnings and stock buybacks have been accelerating in the past two years.","I finished a series on dividend kings, companies that have paid an increasing dividend for 50 or more years. The series of 18 articles has produced companies that range from small cap to large cap with varying dividend growth rates from 1% to 26%. I really expected all of these companies to be good investments but some of them disappointed me. I wound up doing focus articles on companies that very quickly could be seen as not good long term investments when compared using the Good Business Guidelines.So I got the idea of another series, companies that only had one letter in their symbol (no logical reason for this but just for fun), but did not want to do full reviews of companies that did not show promise. This is the fourth part of the series. I calculated the total return for each of the next 6 companies and will do individual articles on the ones that pass the positive total return guideline for the last 44.0 months. I chose the 44.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending in late August) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance.Here's the next six companies. As a minimum this study will find some good company investments like the dividend kings series did .The Dow baseline for 44.0 months is 41.03%Average total return for the first 12 companies is 24.13% underperforming as a group by 16.90%.This leaves us with two companies of the second set that pass the screen so we will continue with an individual look at the fundamentals of Genpact Ltd. found below as part 4. Additional articles Part 5 will look at the fundamentals of Kellogg of this series and part 6 will look at the next 6 companies that have single letter symbols and maybe find some more interesting investments.This article is about Genpact Ltd. and why it's a total return growth company that is being reviewed by The Good Business Portfolio. Genpact Limited is engaged in providing digitally-powered business process management and services. The Company designs, transforms and runs a combination of processes, as well as provides solutions that combine elements of several of its service offerings. Fundamentals of Genpact Ltd. will be looked at in the following topics, The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, Total Return And Yearly Dividend, Last Quarter's Earnings, Company Business Overview, and Takeaways And Recent Portfolio Changes.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.Genpact Ltd. passes 8 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, momentum, total return, and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Genpact Ltd. is a mid-cap company with a capitalization of $5.0 billion. In the Data Processing & Outsourcing Services sub-sector Genpact Ltd. is one of the largest with most of the others in the $2 Billion cap size or smaller, therefore Genpact Ltd. has the muscle to weather the storm when it comes. Earnings flow is good and covers the company's expansion plans.Genpact Ltd. does not pay a dividend but the company has been aggressively buying back its shares as part of a $500 Million buyback program Genpact Ltd. is therefore not a income company but its good growth make it an interesting investment for those who understand the competition and business they are in.Genpact Ltd. last quarterly earnings is close to last years at $0.36/share which leaves Genpact Ltd. good cash flow and have enough left over for its continued business expansion and share buybacks.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.1% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5%. Genpact Ltd. has a three-year CAGR of 13% more than meeting my requirement. Looking back five years $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $17,200 today (from S&P IQ). This makes Genpact Ltd. a good investment for the growth investor.Genpact Ltd. S&P Capital IQ rating is three star or hold with a target price of $27. Genpact Ltd. is then under priced by 15% at present and a good choice for the growth investor with its accelerating earnings.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio, the total return guideline was just added to my list of guidelines. Genpact Ltd. did much better than the Dow baseline in my 44.0 month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 44.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. Modeling the Dow average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the 11 guidelines as a filter for company selection. The good total return makes Genpact Ltd. a company for the total return growth investor. Genpact Ltd. does not pay a dividend so the company is not an income investment. DOW's 44.0 month total return baseline is 41.03%. The total return during the test period for Genpact Ltd. is above the DOW average at 63.54% beating the DOW baseline by 35.80%.Dow Baseline 41.03%G data by YChartsLast Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter on August 3, 2016 Genpact Ltd. reported earnings that beat expected earnings at $0.36 compared to expected at $0.33 and last year at $0.32. Total revenue was higher at $630.5 Million up from last year by 3.4% and missed expected revenue by $12 Million. This was a good report showing higher earnings of 10% year over year. Earnings for the next quarter will be out in early November and is expected to be $0.36 compared to last year at $0.35. Genpact Ltd. guided there total earnings for 2016 to $1.40-$1.42 enough to cover business expansion and some share buy backs.Business OverviewGenpact Ltd. is engaged in providing digitally-powered business process management and services. The Company designs, transforms and runs a combination of processes, as well as provides solutions that combine elements of several of its service offerings. The Company offers various vertical activities, which include banking and financial services, insurance services, capital markets, consumer product goods services, life sciences and pharmaceutical services, infrastructure and manufacturing services, healthcare and high tech services. In addition to these vertical activities, it also offers finance and accounting (F&A) services, analytics and research, business consulting services, enterprise risk consulting, supply chain and procurement services, enterprise application services, information technology (NYSE:IT) management services, and collections and customer services.The company has a $500 Million buyback program of which $313 Million has been bought. In the last quarter they bought back $53 Million of their stock. One of my guidelines is would you buy the whole business if you could, right now I would not buy Genpact Ltd. because I do not fully understand the products they provide which are very diverse in many business applications. I will watch it a while until I feel comfortable with the business, being in retirement I am very conservative. If I were 20 years younger Genpact Ltd. would be a buy for me looking at the total return numbers and future growth prospects. One headwind is the currency exchange rates from the companies foreign operations, but seems to be under control. Also General Electric (NYSE:GE) is 17% of the company's revenues, who knows maybe GE will buy the whole company.Takeaways and Recent Portfolio ChangesGenpact Ltd. is a good investment for the total return growth investor that can understand fully the varied business products and services that the company provides. Genpact Ltd. will not be considered for The Good Business Portfolio right now because I really do not understand the business and there isn't any dividend income. I am very bad at picking tech companies and will leave this growing company for others that can understand the business and I will take time to watch it.Sold some Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) covered calls, sold October $52.5's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that CAB goes up so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a Double.Bought starter position of Digital Reality Trust (NYSE:DLR) of 0.52% of the portfolio. I feel the computer industry facilities business has nowhere to go but up and DLR pays an above average dividend. I wrote an article on Digital Reality Trust in April of this year if you are interested.Sold some covered calls on Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), sold August 50's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that HOG goes up so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a Double. The HOG price is presently above the strike price and I have moved the calls up and out. On August 10 the portfolio moved the HOG calls up and out to November 52.5's.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 8.5% of the portfolio, Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) is 7.8% of the portfolio, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 8.0% of portfolio and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 7.8% of the portfolio, therefore JNJ and HD are now in trim position with Boeing and Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on individual 787 plane costs, announced in the 2015 fourth quarter earnings call. For BA from the second 2016 earnings call deferred costs increased $33 Million a small amount and I project positive cash from the 787 program in the third quarter of possibly $100 Million. The KC-46A refueling plane has been authorized by the Pentagon for its initial production, this will be a big step to increase Boeing's already high cash flow even more. The contract has still to be awarded, which should be soon. Looking forward I expect Boeing to beat the expected third quarter earnings of $2.52 but will not trim it until it reaches 10.0% of the portfolio. About 1.6 years ago Boeing got above 10% of the portfolio and I trimmed it a little to get it below 10% of the portfolio.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post Brexit world.For the total Good Business Portfolio please see my recent article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2016 Second-Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance. Become a real time follower and you will get each quarters performance after the earnings season is over.I have written individual articles on CAB, JNJ, EOS, GE, IR, MO, BA, AA, Omega Health Investors and HD that are in The Good Business Portfolio and other companies being evaluated by the portfolio.

As further progress is made on the digital front, growth concerns should prove unfounded.","Genpact (G) has successfully shed its ""GE in-house center"" image and emerged as a large BPO player with the ability to become a strategic transformation partner to its clients. Despite its size, the company has delivered a 9% revenue CAGR over the last 5-6 years and is expected to deliver 10%+ growth in FY19. More so, the company has successfully been able to deliver strong growth in EPS and has met guidance sequentially over the last few years. The company’s balance sheet is not highly leveraged, yet it successfully returned over a billion dollars to its shareholders in the last five years. Management is highly capable, with experienced and diverse leaders handling various business units and functions. Shares trade at a discounted multiple relative to its peers, which leaves ample room for an eventual re-rating.Genpact recently held its 2019 Analyst/Investor Day. The overarching theme of this year’s analyst day was Genpact’s focus on embracing ""Digital Transformation"" to expand its current market share and capture a portion of the new market emerging from digital applications. The core business has been performing as well, delivering operational excellence as reflected by the continuous improvement in margins and service delivery quality.Genpact is already one of the largest pure-play BPO companies with revenues of $3B+. Last year, the company took a strategic decision to tie its executives’ salaries to the company’s digital revenue. This seems to be handsomely paying off, as evidenced by Digital’s 25% contribution to the company’s annual revenue. This is coming at a time when other major organizations, especially in the BPO space, are struggling to classify their revenue streams in Digital and non-Digital. The company no longer sees itself as a BPO vendor to its clients, but a strategic partner working hand-in-hand with their clients in their digital transformation journeys.Source: Company PresentationThe vendor needs to not just embrace the new technologies along with their domain knowledge, but they also need to come up with effective commercial models that will help them win the trust of their clients. Genpact seems to be going that route quite successfully. They are innovating on the pricing models with more share-gain and outcome-based contracts coming into the picture.The company has built domain knowledge over the last 20 years of its existence across the six verticals it currently operates in. The revenue composition is nicely balanced across three categories that the company publicly declares.Source: Investor FactsheetThe company has 24 clients with more than $25M of annual revenue, contributing 42% to the total company revenue. This is something that the company prides itself on, as well. But I believe this is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you get operating leverage benefits by having focused leadership for a large account, but the flip side of having a few large accounts is that it concentrates the company’s revenue risk into those accounts. If the company churns a small number of accounts from that bracket, it will become difficult to plug the large revenue gaps which this will create.Source: Company PresentationThe company has also outperformed in its cost discipline, evident from the continuous margin improvement which the company has delivered for the last five years. In particular, management is utilizing operating leverage well, as G&A has sequentially reduced from being 16% of the revenue in 2014 to just 12.2% of the revenue in 2018. But this 380bps reduction in G&A doesn’t seem to be entirely translating to operating margin improvement, with the adjusted OM% increasing by just 70 bps over the same period. An in-depth look at the numbers reveals that the gross margin has been diluted by 350bps over the same period, which is cushioning some of the improvements in G&A, translating entirely into OM improvements.Source: Investor FactsheetI believe GM dilution is inevitable in this industry. The clients are becoming aggressive in terms of asking price discounts and upfront commitments. Yet, Genpact has been able to deliver a higher EPS CAGR (14%) as compared to its revenue CAGR (9%).The company has been able to boost EPS primarily through share repurchases, where it has spent $1.25B in the last five years. I believe it’s a smart strategy to return capital to shareholders if there aren’t many investment opportunities for the company which return at least the cost of equity. The company’s capital management strategy has, thus, been very optimal. It has not only utilized excess cash for M&As and returned the money to shareholders, but it has also used its investment-grade credit rating to its full advantage by raising additional debt over the last five years and remaining within the targeted leverage level of 1-2x.Source: Company PresentationAt the company’s Q2 2019 results announcement, management provided revenue guidance of $3.46B - $3.50B and adjusted EPS guidance of $2.00 - $2.02. The company reiterated its guidance during the analyst day and seemed confident of meeting these numbers.Summarily, I think the company put a strong foot forward in the form of highlighting its capability superiority in Digital transformation, a strong client connect, and a disciplined fiscal approach. It now depends on how the company navigates the new era in terms of building reasonable commercial models (i.e., without taking too much risk on to itself) and how the early successes in digital transformation translate to major market gains.Genpact's peer group consists of the following: EXL and WNS (purely international BPOs with clients in North America and Europe), as well as HGS and Firstsource (also with domestic clients in geographies like India and the Philippines). While the market typically gives more of a premium to companies with greater international exposure, Genpact trades at a discount to EXL and WNS, with the multiple gap particularly acute on the PEG metric (2.8x vs 4.3x peer average).Source: Gurufocus, Moneycontrol, share prices as of Oct 16, 2019Genpact recently firmed up its guidance, which management had already shared in Q2 2019, a positive development coming right after the raised guide in Q2. The company’s financials are tracking well, and the company seems to be navigating the switch from traditional BPO to digital well. Considering the strong track record, I am confident that management will deliver on its financial and strategic commitments. Yet, shares trade at the lower end of the multiple range despite having a 25% digital revenue contribution. The company’s relatively larger size compared to its peers may be driving investor confidence down in terms of potential growth, but with the digital pivot, I believe such concerns will prove unfounded and shares will correct over the longer term."

Genpact did not file an 8-K for the deal and did not indicate any change in guidance as a result of the transaction, so it appears that the amount paid was not material to Genpact’s financial condition.Given Genpact is a nearly $6 billion market cap company, it likely paid less than $50 million for the deal.As of Genpact’s most recent results, it had $441 million in cash and equivalents and $1.98 billion in total liabilities.Genpact is in the middle of a transformation from a BPO firm to a value-added AI-driven firm, of which the recent launch of its Cora platform is the latest evidence.Its acquisition of OnSource’s Inspection-as-a-Service [IaaS] will be folded into the Cora system will provide additional capabilities to Genpact’s claims management system and ‘will allow carriers to seamlessly write accurate estimates and manage supplements in a much quicker and more collaborative manner, resulting in significantly higher customer satisfaction.’As part of Genpact, OnSource’s system will therefore be marketed to Genpact’s existing customer bases as well as providing an added offering to sell to prospective customers.As Tim Schneider, CEO of OnSource stated in the deal announcement,Assuming Genpact didn’t overpay for the deal, the addition of OnSource’s mobile-first system will build on its end-to-end claims processing value proposition for the insurance vertical.I view the acquisition as a positive for Genpact in the medium-term.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

1943221,52262,2014-01-14T20:02:20-05:00,,"Most of my investment interests and research center on financial companies particularly banks and insurance companies both of which I have significant experience dealing with. In light of that, one might wonder why I think IT company Genpact (NYSE:G) is an interesting investment. The key here is that Genpact provides business process services that are widely used across the financial sector and other fields, including in the insurance industry.With a lot of economists expecting 2014 to be a significant growth year for capital expenditures by many firms, and the financial field finally starting to definitively move beyond the Crisis, I think Genpact could see a significant increase in sales this year. At my firm for example, senior management is preparing to expand several departments both to go after new customers and to comply with new Dodd-Frank related regulations. Genpact provides services that we will need for both expansions. My view is that the increased investment environment across the US will lead to many similar situations at other firms and result in strong revenue and profit growth for Genpact this year.Genpact started out as a division of General Electric (NYSE:GE), but was spun off in the early 2000's, and GE has been slowly selling its stake in the company ever since. Genpact's basic business is providing IT services and software to help handle business process functions within finance and accounting. The company's target customers include banks and insurance companies of course, but also include the finance, collections, accounting, and analytics departments at a wide range of firms across other industries. Thus while Genpact is a good play on capex growth in financial services, it is not entirely dependent on that industry.Genpact's services are in areas that most big companies cannot ignore. This extends from accounting services to help prepare SEC-compliant financial statements to cash management operations services. In my own field, the company's processes help with new product development, claims management, underwriting and risk modeling, compliance reporting, and other functions.One key take-away from this is that Genpact's revenues tend to come from long-term stable contracts to provide services to companies. This results in steady cash-flows for the company. The other key point is that in order to provide outsourced services to customers at a reasonable cost savings vs. in-house options, Genpact needs to have a large reliable infrastructure and network of well-trained, but low-cost employees. Setting up this type of system isn't easy and as a result there are pretty significant barrier to entry in the IT services business. This combined with the ~$500 million in cash and cash-equivalents that Genpact is sitting on, give me a pretty good degree of confidence in the longer term business model here.Genpact started out as a captive division of General Electric, but even after it was spun-off, the firm still relied on GE as a major client. Over the last decade though, that has begun to change with increased revenue diversification. In recent conference calls management has reported a strong increase in large deals in its pipeline which is probably part of what is driving the sell-side expectation for 11.5% revenue growth next year (following roughly 12.5% revenue growth this year). While Genpact is likely to see strength across multiple industries in my view, I also think this will be balanced by the headwind coming from reduced business in the mortgage origination area. On the whole while I think most of the firm's verticals look well-positioned for next year, there are still some challenges.With Genpact likely to earn around $1.24 in my view (vs. $1.13 in 2013, and $0.95 on a normalized basis in 2012), the stock does have an appealing degree of growth. That said, the company does seem to have a sizable amount of marketing spending ahead of it based on management commentary. This will be somewhat offset by SG&A expense controls, but nonetheless, the firm's margins are likely to expand only marginally even as it wins new business over the next 12-18 months. Given all this, I think a reasonable multiple to apply to Genpact is 16X forward EPS. Based on my estimate for $1.24 in EPS next year, this suggests Genpact ought to trade around $20 a share. With the stock trading closer to $18 a share today, starting a new position in Genpact is reasonable at these levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in G over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Shares of the company have fallen off January highs due to mixed Q1 results. Pressure on margins and rising debts caused by a spree of acquisitions led to a post earnings drop, however, I believe the company presents opportunity at its current relative valuation. Over the past few years, Genpact has begun the process of a business transformation, adding technological capabilities to their BPO and IT services, which separate them from competition.This has enabled a company that has long suffered from a lack of diversity in their revenue stream to gain a new base of clientele. All the while Genpact has increased revenues and net income. With current tailwinds from a falling rupee and the series of acquisitions at the back of the company I believe Genpact is a BUY at its current 17x fwd earnings multiple.Genpact was founded in 1997 as a business unit of GE (NYSE:GE), before spinning off in Jan. 2005. The company provides business process management services using digital-led innovation to improve productivity and customer service experience, manage costs, expand market share, and minimize risk & loss for their clients. Genpact’s patented Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP) system is at the heart of making clients businesses more efficient.The SEP system tests the effectiveness of client processes and identifies areas that can be improved by analyzing millions of client transactions across thousands of end-to-end businesses. This leads to a customized roadmap for maximizing process efficiency. Then domain-specific digital products and solutions that draw on Genpact’s expertise in mobility, cloud, workflow, advanced visualization, robotics, and machine learning are leveraged to increase profits for clients.Source: Source: Genpact Investor PresentationIn 2017, Genpact launched the Automation to AI service, Genpact Cora. Genpact Cora is automation, analytics, and AI technologies platform that allows businesses to find problem areas in their services, which are hurting efficiency and correct the situation. The company also uses Lean Digital SM Innovation Centers to bring together clients, partners and industry leaders in order to learn about new digital solutions that can address their specific business needs. Genpact is in a transition period where they are going from a classic BPO firm to a value-added AI services company. This has been evidenced by the addition of new services like the above as well as the over $500 million in acquisitions the company has made since 2014.ClienteleGenpact serves about one fifth of the Fortune Global 500. This includes clients like Abbott, Boeing, Citigroup, GlaxoSmithKline, Ironshore, Mondelez, PayPal, Sanofi and Wells Fargo. Since Genpact is a spin-off of their number one client, General Electric, historically an overreliance on revenues from GE has been an issue. In 2014, GE accounted for over 20% of the company’s revenues. In 2017 however, GE made up just $269 million, or approximately 9.8% of Genpact’s 2017 revenues.Source: Genpact Investor PresentationGenpact has grown revenues consistently since 2007. The 10% revenue growth figure over the past two years is impressive given falling GE revenues. The company has done an excellent job in counteracting the revenue losses from their GE businesses by increasing global BPO revenues. Genpact’s revenue growth has also always been a result of increased bookings, which are an important indicator of the health of a BPO and IT services firm. Bookings for the full year 2017 were $2.8 billion that’s up 6% on a constant currency basis from $2.65 billion in 2016. Both adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin have also steadily grown for over a decade.Source: Genpact Investor Presentation2017 wasn’t all positives though in fact both income from operations and net income fell YoY. The falling net income despite an increase in revenues is tough to swallow. To add to this other income was up $16.1 million in 2017 and this helped to buoy the net income figure. The increase was primarily due to a one-time subsidy received by one of Genpact’s subsidiaries in India. The biggest red flag when looking into Genpact is the 42% increase in long term debt that was incurred in 2017. Of course, this massive debt increase was due to a plethora of acquisitions (more on this later) that will add value going forward. Still, Genpact has over $714 million in debt obligations maturing within the next 1-3 years alone. The company also had over $170 million in short term borrowings at the end of 2017 and now has $275 million.In 2016, Moody’s Vice President and Senior analyst Kaustubh Chaubal did upgrade Genpact’s debt to investment grade Baa3, from Ba1 saying:Genpact’s diversified business, rigorous management and process organization culture gained from its origins as a spin off from GE, and strong organic growth were also identified by Moody’s as reasons for the upgrade. Another bright spot for Genpact has been their ability to consistently increase FCF and operating cash flow.Source: Genpact Investor PresentationAbove is a chart of Genpact’s 2017 acquisitions. It is a continuation of a recent acquisition spree, which began in 2014 and has focused on improving the company’s digital services segment and the Genpact Cora platform. One example of this is the acquisition of Tandemseven, which came with the UX360 platform. This platform allows customer journeys to be placed on the cloud and then be managed by corporations.Genpact has been able to add this service to the modular Genpact Cora creating Genpact Cora UX360, which will add to the company's increasing data-driven approach to increasing productivity and shareholder value for their clients.Source: Genpact Investor PresentationGenpact is excited about the scalable and replicable digital solutions offered by their new service Genpact Cora. In the Q4 2017 conference call, CEO NV Tyagarajan gave some examples of how the service is working in multiple industries:Genpact is a company on the move. This was evidenced once again just recently by the decision to acquire Commonwealth Informatics for an undisclosed amount. Commonwealth Informatics is a provider of cloud-based drug safety analytics products and services for medical research and healthcare delivery businesses. Balkrishan ""BK"" Kalra, business leader for Life Sciences and Healthcare at Genpact discussed the advantages of this deal in a recent interview:Although Genpact still offers traditional BPO services and this makes up a significant portion of their revenues, new technologies like AI and robotics are transforming the way the company does business. The plethora of recent acquisitions represent Genpact’s attempts to modernize their services with value-added solutions that increase efficiency and profitability.- EPS of $0.39 beats by $0.02- Revenue of $688.91M (+ 10.6% Y/Y) beats by $8.2MIt was a mixed start to 2018 for Genpact. Shares of the company have fallen over 10% off January highs, most of that due to a post earnings drop in May. This, despite both a revenue and earnings beat in Q1 (as seen above). At least, tailwinds are now at the back of the company for the rest of 2018 according to management. This led Genpact to keep 2018 estimates in line with previous expectations. However, Q1 really wasn’t all that investors had hoped for.I would like to start with a couple of caveats in regards to the Q1 2018 EPS beat. First, the reported figure is in fact adjusted EPS and not actual EPS. There seems to be a disturbing trend among publicly traded companies to report, or at least only speak of, adjusted EPS or EBITDA figures. This while also consistently obscuring actual GAAP measures. Genpact is not close to one of the most egregious offenders here, but nonetheless investors who do only a cursory dive into the figures might come away with misleading assumptions about financial strength so I feel this is important to mention.EPS is recorded as a beat in Q1 2018 for Genpact, but it was a beat of the adjusted EPS analyst estimates. Actual EPS was $0.33/per share, which is still up 25% YoY. This brings me to my second caveat however, which has to do with the continued share buybacks, which have buoyed EPS figures. Since the initiation of the share repurchase program in 2015, Genpact has repurchased approx. $890 million of shares at an average price of $25.57 per share. Returning cash to shareholders through buybacks is not a bad thing, but for now its serves to obscure actual earnings figures.G EPS Diluted (Quarterly) data by YChartsAdjusted income from operations for the quarter was $97.4 million, which is up 11% YoY, with a corresponding margin of 14.1%. However, once again Genpact has adjusted their numbers quite substantially. Unadjusted Income from operations was actually down 19% YoY to $64 million for the quarter. This along with the increasing debt due to acquisitions I touched on earlier caused the net debt to EBITDA ratio to rise to 1.9, from 1.6 at year-end.Gross margins were also down to 35.5% in Q1 vs. 38.5% in the same period last year. These numbers were achieved with a low effective tax rate for the quarter as well, 15.7 vs. 18.7% last year. On the surface it appears Q1 was a great one for the company. And it was in some ways, revenue and net income both continued to increase, however margins fell as the new acquisitions are clearly causing growing pains at the company. There is room for positivity however, Genpact believes the worst of 2018 is behind them and thus they have keep full year expectations in line with previous estimates. As CFO Edward J. Fitzpatrick noted in the Q1 conference call:Mr. Fitzpatrick’s note on the impact of the Indian rupee is of particular importance here. As a BPO (business process outsourcer), the impact of a strengthening rupee on costs is substantial for Genpact. Luckily, for the company, over the past 6 months, the rupee has depreciated around 8.25%. This will be a significant tailwind for Genpact going forward.Another positive of Q1 2018 was the continued move away from General Electric as a key source of revenue. GE now only accounts for 8% of total revenue. Despite YoY revenues for GE being down 31% Genpact was still able to increase overall revenues by an impressive 11% for the quarter(9% on constant currency basis). Overall it was a solid start to 2018 for Genpact, but the second half of the year should be even better.Looking at Genpact’s current valuation, we can see that the company is fairly valued vs. its five-year average. However, I would argue that Genpact has grown by leaps and bounds over the past five years. Their growing list of fortune 500 clientele, diversified and growing revenue stream, multitude of value-add acquisitions and evolving business model mean the company deserves a higher valuation.Looking at a much larger peer (MKT CAP ~$60 billion) like Automatic Data Processing (NYSE: ADP), we can see Genpact does trade at a significant discount to industry leaders. Although ADP has some scale and perhaps technological advantages, and their most recent quarter was a standout, Genpact definitely deserves a valuation much closer to this industry leader than it is currently granted by investors.Table Compiled by Author From Morningstar (1) (2)Genpact’s transformation over the past few years has been impressive, if costly. A new focus on value-added services like automation, analytics, and AI technologies that are specific to clientele and industries has allowed the company to entice new clientele and diversify their revenue stream. Acquisitions have added new technologies and services, which help increase client efficiency.However, all of this led to increasing debts and falling margins as Genpact attempts to integrate the multitude of different businesses into a cohesive unit. In Q1, we witnessed the costs of this transformation affect Genpact, and that dropped share prices substantially. Now, the company has fallen to a 17x fwd earnings valuation and with tailwinds in the rest of 2018, I believe Genpact presents an opportunity for investors."

The company provides BPO and IT services to diversified customers like BFSI, transportation, manufacturing and healthcare industries. Companies outsource their work to Genpact primarily because of their skilled yet cheap labor. India's human talent pool offers the best strategic location to Genpact. It is considered to be the pioneer of the business processing outsourcing industry. Over the years, the company has built robust business processes, pooled specific-skilled human capital, built a strong training gamut and won itself extensive global clients. Genpact was formerly a GE-owned company until the spin-off in 2005. Genpact has grown its non-GE revenue by 65%, annually, after its spin-off from GE.Genpact is once again positioned in the Leaders quadrant by Gartner for the fourth consecutive year. This is a positive development for the company as it shows a strong pipeline which Genpact has in terms of leaders who possess a vision and who are able to execute the plan.Genpact registered healthy performance despite a weak global economic climate. The company has healthy future prospects with better sales force productivity and with big deals in its pipeline.This would help the company to grow organically. The company's 1Q2013 results were above expectations due to robust Business Process Management (BPM) and Global Client Momentum.The recent quarter's results were better than expected: The company generated revenue of $503.8 million (versus the consensus of $499.1 million) in 1Q2013, up 15.7% from $435.5 million in 1Q2012. The company's revenue growth was 13% YoY excluding JAWOOD and Accounting Plaza (elaborated later in the article). Net income surged 21.3% to $46.7 million in 1Q2013 from $38.5 million in 1Q2012. The net income margin rose to 9.3% in 1Q2013 from 8.9% in 1Q2012. The company posted earnings per share of $0.20 (versus $0.17 in 1Q2012) above the consensus estimates of $0.18.Genpact's global clients segment increased 21% YoY, constituting 76.8% of revenues. The GE segment increased 1.0% YoY, representing 23.2% of revenues.The BPO segment increased 16% YoY, which accounts for 76.2% in revenue, while the growth in the IT Services segment was registered at 14% YoY, which accounts for 23.8% of revenues. On a more granular basis, the revenue from the BPO Global Client increased 22% YoY and revenue from the IT Services Global Client rose 19% YoY. SDS, constituting 15% of revenues, remained flat in 1Q2013. In IT Services, GE posted a growth of 7% YoY while Global Clients grew 19% YoY.Of total revenue of $503.8 million in the previous quarter the revenue from GE was $117.05 million (representing 23.23%) while the revenue from the global clients segment was $386.8 million (representing 76.77%). GE remains the primary source of revenues for Genpact. However, the non-GE clientele of the company is well diversified. The company generates about 21% of its revenue from its Top 10 clients, which is well diversified when compared to its peers. The company generates revenue of $1 million or more from 204 clients, and 75 clients contribute $5 million or more.BPO recorded growth of 20% YoY after excluding Smart Decision Services (SDS). BFSI, which represents 43% of revenue, grew 21% YoY, Technology, Healthcare and Other Services, which represents 24% of revenue, grew 14% YoY, with Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment Manufacturing representing 33% of revenue, growing 11% YoY.The Smart Decision Services division contributes 15% of the company's revenue. The company saw some slow down in the SDS segment primarily due to a large chunk of its clients deciding to work in-house rather than outsource. The company expects headwinds in the next couple of quarters as it foresees more clients moving work in-house. The company expects this slowdown to be temporary, and stated that the overall demand for this division would remain strong as the year progresses.The profitability margins of the company are above the industry's average because of the efforts taken by the company to add value through its complex processes.Cash and cash equivalents and short term deposits were $493 million as of March 31, 2013, up from $478 million in the prior quarter. With a healthy cash balance, the company is actively seeking to shop small and innovative organizations.Operating cash flow rose to $31.55 million in the quarter from $4.91 million in 1Q2012. The marked increase can be attributed to accelerated payment and partly to a fraction of annual bonus payments paid in the second quarter instead of the first quarter in the previous year. The operating cash flow is expected to plummet by 10%-15% in FY13 driven by a one-time payment of $45 million received in 2Q2012 from a client, high debt servicing costs and other non-recurring cash outflows in 2012. The capital expenditures for FY2013 are expected to be fairly consistent between 3% and 4% (of revenue) compared to 4.1% in FY2012.The company reaffirmed its revenue guidance for FY2013 to be between $2.15 billion and $2.20 billion, representing a growth of 13% of 16%, above the industry's growth rate.The company is expected to increase its sales and marketing expenses in FY14 on the grounds of increasing investments in its client-facing sales team. The company would increase its sales-team head count by 20-30 employees in 2013.Genpact acquired Headstrong in May 2011 for $550 million in cash. Headstrong provides consulting and IT services focusing on capital markets and healthcare.Genpact acquired Accounting Plaza in 2012 to gain a foothold in retail industry and in the European delivery services market.Genpact acquired Jawood in February 2013, and also purchased India-based Felix Software, the main subcontracted service provider to Jawood. About 420 employees of Jawood and Felix Software joined Genpact's workforce and contribute to Genpact's healthcare and IT services businesses. With enormous growth in the healthcare payer industry especially in the area of ICD9-10 conversion, the acquisition would help Genpact capitalize on the healthcare payor market as well as provide it room to cross-sell for ancillary and complementary BPO services. The company expects JAWOOD to contribute 2% of revenue or $45 million in FY13. The growth in the BPO segment is expected to be higher compared to the IT services segment growth.Bain Capital Partners is a private investment firm. It manages various pools of capital that include public equity, private equity, credit products, venture capital and absolute return products. Bain has about $65 billion in assets under its management. In August 2012, Bain bought $1 billion shares of Genpact from its existing sponsors. Bain now owns a 30% stake in Genpact and has 4 representatives on Genpact's board, out of a total of 10.Employees' strength increased 6.55% YoY in 1Q2013. The attrition rate was 24% versus 23% in 1Q2012. Revenue per employee increased to $34,500 in 1Q2013 from $32,200 in 1Q2012. The company increased its salesforce by 45% in the year 2012. The company expects to capitalize on this increased salesforce in the year 2014, with large deals they have in the pipeline.The Senate is working on immigration legislation, pursuant to which the foreign outsourcing firms would have to pay more if they want to continue getting the services of temporary foreign workers on H-1B visas. This bill is trying to put domestic workers to use while discouraging the use of temporary foreign workers on H-1B visas. The bill would result in the halt of issuance of fresh H-1B in 2015. If the percentage of employees in the U.S. exceeds 75%. This percentage would reduce to 65% in 2016 and would further be scaled down to 50% in 2017. These measures would affect the outsourcing companies adversely by chopping down their primary advantage of low costs.The bill would raise wage costs by preventing vendors from employing H-1B or L-1 employees that have more than 15% of their U.S workforce as ""visa dependent.""Employers that have employed 30%-50% of their employees on H-1B or L-1 visas of their total workforce will have to pay $5,000 for each additional H-1B or L-1 employee versus the current fee of $2,500. Employers with 50% of their U.S. employees on H-1B or L-1 visas will now be charged $10,000 fee for an additional H-1B or L-1 employee versus the current fee of $5,000. For L-1 visas the fee change would be effective from FY14 while for H-1B visas it would be effective from FY15.Companies that are expected to be negatively impacted by the visa reform are Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro, Syntel and iGate since they currently have a ratio of H1-B employees more than the specified percentage. The companies that are not going to be impacted are VRTU, G, EXLS and WNS, since their existing H1-B employees ratio is below the threshold limits.Genpact has approximately 7.3% of its headcount deployed in the U.S., with the major chunk of the work being BPO-focused. The company, though, did not divulge its current percentage of workers on H-1B visas working in the U.S. However, it stated that the current bill would not impact the company since its employees on H-1B visas in the U.S. is below the threshold limit of 15%.The company's core BPO business remains intact. The company is a leader in BFSI vertical. With better than expected quarterly results and the company displaying decent organic revenue growth, we see steady growth for the company as it starts capitalizing on its recent investments. With these positives, the company is expected to post solid, above-industry-average growth even in uncertain times. The company expects to see some drag in IT services due to the strength capital markets experienced of late. The company expects the decision-making cycle times for bigger projects to remain long, but would be short for small projects.Key TakeawaysKey RisksCompetitive Landscape: Genpact competes with global giants like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Capegemini. These giants penetrated further into their customers, cross-selling them more than their consulting services. In the outsourcing industry, contracts are signed for long periods; a typical contract is expected to last for as long as 7 years. However, as these contracts now mature and come around for a second round of bids, it is expected to open new avenues for players like Genpact. The companies offshore failed to reap expected cost benefits from their existing outsourced partners due to their limited expertise in off-shoring. On the other hand, players like Genpact are upbeat to help these companies realize cost-savings in the range of 25% to 30% on average. Thus, outsourcing services providers like Genpact are expected to benefit afair deal from the latest developments.Genpact is not only a pioneer but also the biggest player in the business process outsourcing services' industry. According to International Data Corporation, the global BPO industry is expected to grow at a growth rate of 7.8% in 2013 from its current total of $250 billion. Given its talent pool and its expertise as a service provider, Genpact is expected to leverage the underpenetrated global outsourcing industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The prospects of companies operating in this industry come down to global business activity and competitive advantage between companies. Genpact Ltd. (NYSE:G) is the global leader in the business process management and technology services.Genpact was established in 1997 as a business unit of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) capital wing, GE Capital. Later, the unit started to grow and provide services to the other segments of GE and in FY05 the company became a separate independent entity while maintaining GE as a major client. Genpact's global operations provide substantial strategic advantage to the company as it operates across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, Australia and Africa. The company's services range across core businesses and specific industries.A number of researchers and analysts have pointed out towards various trends which suggest that the global economic recovery will be underway by FY14 with a decent momentum. The status of global equity markets presents proof of this belief. Therefore, a recovery in economic activity will have a positive impact on the revenues of the company and the geographical diversification will help in exploring new revenue targets and mitigating regional risks.Financial PerformanceThe company was listed on NYSE in FY07. Since then, the company has posted substantial top line growth and the quality of services has proved superior as in this process, Genpact established itself as a global leader.Data Source: MorningstarThe above chart shows the cash flow generation from operating activities over the period of five years in millions of USD. From FY09 onwards, a substantial growth is visible in these cash flows. The company's revenues have produced a CAGR of 18.24% in this period. Similarly, the net income has posted a CAGR of 27.13%.Data Source: MorningstarThe above figure illustrates the increase in total assets in the past five years in millions of USD. The company's financial performance and growth in net income and revenues has been maintained within the company in order to pursue future prospects.Source: YChartsThe chart above shows the revenues and return on equity produced by the business over the period of five years. The chart reflects the growth that has occurred over difficult economic periods. Therefore, the company's growth prospects are expected to enhance in the future on the back of improvement in the larger economic framework.Comparative ValuationAs mentioned before, Genpact has shown a substantial growth but at the same time, the markets have not recognized the potential of the company as yet as the business process management and technology services industry isn't one of the most popular industries among investors.Source: MorningstarThe table above draws a comparison between Genpact, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), SGS Ltd. (NYSEMKT:SGS) and Experian Plc. (OTCQX:EXPGY). The table also compares key statistics of Genpact with the industry averages.The company's undervaluation as compared to its peers and the rest of the industry is quite evident as almost all valuation metrics suggest that the company is priced below the intrinsic value. These metrics propose a substantial upside potential for investors as the company continues to pursue its growth prospects and in the process, stimulates investor interests further. The company's phenomenal average revenue growth of 19.3% in the last three years is unmatched across all competitors as it operates at stronger profit margins than the industry and at the same time, taps into a larger volume through its global network.Potential Risk FactorsAs the company performs its functions in an advisory role across the globe, the major threat comes from a possible slowdown in the global economy. If the analysts' estimates of global recovery in FY14 start to fall short, the company's growth momentum may be broken down to irreparable extent. Therefore, if the debt crisis, which is looming large in the European region, continues to persist, it will have a sizable adverse effect on the size of company's business and growth. Similarly, concerns about the huge debt of the US economy and other threatening economic or financial shocks in US or emerging economies, can produce negative impacts.ConclusionAccording to Morningstar statistics, the company operates at a beta of 1. This means that there is a direct relationship between the performance of the company and the market portfolio. Therefore, the threats posed by the aforementioned risk factors are considerable. However, I find that the company has already shown clear evidence of robust performance under grim circumstances. Furthermore, the company has a global network but it has not been fully explored. Genpact has the space to consider further expansion and exploration of emerging global prospects, and generate substantial growth in the future.Based on these factors, long-term investors are proposed to pursue a buy recommendation for Genpact as its growth prospects are strong and the market simultaneously undervalues the company's potential. Therefore, the company has substantial upside potential and can prove to be a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

716331,24491,2012-07-12T02:19:06-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Genpact's (G) case, we think the firm is undervalued. We think it is fairly valued at $23 per share. Our report on Genpact and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Genpact posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'undervalued' DCF assessment of the company, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. We use Booz Allen (BAH), Corrections Corp (CXW), FTI Consulting (FCN), and Huron Consulting (HURN) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Genpact imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsGenpact's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.The firm's shares are trading at an attractive level at this time. Given the company's track record of solid business performance, we'd take a closer look at picking up some of the firm's shares. If the firm's share price fell below $18, we'd consider adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Genpact has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 25.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 20%.The firm's share price performance has been roughly in line with that of the market during the past quarter. We'd expect the firm's stock price to converge to our fair value estimate within the next three years, if our forecasts prove accurate.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 15.4% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Genpact's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 40.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Genpact's free cash flow margin has averaged about 11.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Genpact, cash flow from operations increased about 61% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 32% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Genpact's shares are worth between $18.00 - $28.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $23 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 28.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 17.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 10.5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 15.4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 31.5%, which is above Genpact's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Genpact, we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $23 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Genpact. We think the firm is attractive below $18 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $28 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Genpact's fair value at this point in time to be about $23 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Genpact's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $31 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $23 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

At the same time, I believe it is quite likely that the total number of shares tendered will be below the $300m, and thus pro rata adjustments to tendering shareholders might not be applicable, making it a guaranteed purchase for all tendered.Company background and historical performanceGenpact provides business process management and information technology services worldwide with a focus on outsourcing solutions.

Genpact is also well capitalized with debt/assets ratio of 33% (the company has been reducing debt lately).So overall we have a growing business with strong balance sheet and with a track record of good performance.Other Seeking Alpha articles on Genpact provide good background info and offer potential undervaluation arguments. Thus for anyone worried about downside risk of this offer, I would recommend having a look at those articles.Structure of the tender offerGenpact is conducting the tender offer through a procedure commonly called a modified Dutch auction. This procedure allows investors to select the price, within the range specified by the company, at which the individual investor is willing to sell the shares. The price range for the offer is $16.50 per share to $18.00 per share. The company will select the lowest purchase price, not greater than $18.00 per share nor less than $16.50 per share, that will allow it purchase $300m of stock, based on the number of shares tendered. Genpact will purchase all shares at the final purchase price, thus even if you have selected a purchase price lower than the final purchase price, your shares will be tendered at the final purchase price. However, the company will not purchase any shares tendered at a price above the final purchase price.If, based on the final purchase price, more than $300m of shares are properly tendered, the company will purchase Shares on a pro rata basis, except for holders of less than 100 shares (Odd Lot), which will be purchased on a priority basis.Thus, if investor wants a guaranteed purchase at the tender, he/she had to buy less than 100 shares and tender them all at price of $16.50 (these are likely to be bought at final purchase price of $18). This might seem like too small amount for some, but if one has a number of accounts, this procedure can be replicated across all of them (it is important though to keep the share-count in each account below 100).Side note: even though odd lot holders will indicate tender price of $16.5, it is unlikely to materially affect the final purchase price as odd lot holders will constitute a minority of all tendered shares minority (we would need 176k of odd lot holders to absorb the whole offer).Likelihood of the tender offer going through is 100%The purpose of this tender offer is primarily to return excess capital to shareholders and to increase the intrinsic value per share for the remaining shareholders. At the end of 2013 the company had $570m in cash and saw the $300m tender offer as the most productive use of this capital. Quite a few tender offers are conditional on funding, but in this case the funds are already available in the company from internally generated cash flow. There are no further conditions attached to the offer, so even if less than $300m of stock is tendered the offer will go through. Thus, I do not see any reasons at all why this particular tender offer might be cancelled and in two weeks I do not believe much can change.Why $18 share price is expected?The company has traded at or above $18 per share for most of this year and actually the average share price during the last 4 years has been c. $16.5. With the market valuing the company above the upper limit of the offer for most of 2013, I hardly believe any investors would be willing to tender below the $18. Liquidity ($35m daily) is also sufficient to sell bigger positions in the open market, thus the tender offer does not offer any advantage for liquidation of larger holdings.Besides, management, directors and main shareholder (Bain Capital with 25%) think that even at the price of $18 the shares are undervalued and have indicated that they will not participate in the offer. It is likely that other institutional holders also believe Genpact to be undervalued by the market and will not tender shares at all.The most likely scenario I foresee is that the total amount of shares tendered will be below the $300m, which will force company to accept all tendered shares at the highest offer price of $18. The second most likely scenario is that even though there will be more than $300m shares tendered the final purchase price will still be $18 (it is unlikely many investor will indicate a lower price). In this case, all odd lot holders will be guaranteed purchase at $18, and for others shares will be purchased on pro-rata basis.If the worst happens and the final purchase price is $16.5 (which I view as very unlikely), the odd lot holders, who have tendered at this price would suffer a loss. To avoid this, one should tender shares at the price purchased (e.g. $17) or at a higher offer limit (i.e. $18). Then if shares do not get bought in the tender, the investor can resell them in the open market where share price is likely to be higher than $16.5 (see other SA articles providing arguments for undervaluation of the company, most of these were written while share price was above $18). Thus the downside risk is very limited and unlikely to materialize.ConclusionInvestors have an opportunity to realize 5% yield in two weeks (130% annualized) by participating in the Genpact tender offer. Management considers company to be undervalued and it using this tender offer to distribute cash to shareholders and increase the value for the remaining shareholders. The tender offer is very likely to go through at the price of $18/share and for holders of less than 100 shares the purchase is guaranteed. Investors with multiple trading accounts can achieve these returns in each of the accounts.Disclosure: I am long G. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

42990,20952,2007-07-31T08:29:15-04:00,,"Genpact (NYSE:G) is primarily a business process management company, providing business process outsourcing [BPO] and software implementation solutions to its clients worldwide. It began in 1997 as the India-based captive business process services operation for General Electric Capital Corporation, or GE Capital, GE’s financial services business, and became an independent company at the beginning of 2005. Prior to December 30, 2004, the business of the Company was conducted through various entities and divisions of the General Electric Company (‘‘GE’’). In ‘‘2004 Reorganization’’ when company's all operations brought under single entity, the valuation of company was determined at $779,859,000 which include $485,234,000 as Goodwill. And if this offering got through the valuation of company will comes out at nearly $3,508,894,979. Company earns most of its revenue from offshore BPO solutions, with operations in India contribute nearly 80% of total revenue. To date, the company has 26,731 employees and 27 delivery centers in various parts of world:  Business/Company Outlook In the offshore BPO business, the companies in developed countries with high labour cost shift some or most of their business processes like data entry, inquiry handling, documentation, tele marketing, customer care help lines, data analysis etc (which can be done and deliver through electronic medium) to other countries with cheap & skilled labour. The mail reason behind the evolution of offshore BPO business is the cost advantage due to availably of cheap and skilled labour in various developing countries. With time, this cost advantage has been reduced to some extent due to rising economic conditions that has lead to hefty pay rises in developing countries. Moreover, recent declines in the dollar puts extra pressure on margins of these offshore BPO companies that are already working with thin margins. As most of these companies earn in dollars but spend in local currency, every 1% decline in the dollar can easily hit the company's margins by 0.5%. The effect of this exchange difference is not fully evident as of yet due to currency hedge done by most of the companies, but as we go forward if the dollar doesn't rise, the effect will be much more evident and hard on offshore BPO companies. The industry in dollar terms will keep growing with time, but if dollar stay at these levels, the advantage of offshore BPO business will be decline. All in all, the future of offshore BPO depends on economic advantage it can deliver as compare to onsite and in-house business process units, which currently is on decline. With long-term big deals in hand, Genpact's revenue is expected to rise in the future, but due to geographic mix of its earning and spending, margins remain uncertain. Financials ($ in million) Company's financial year ends on December 31.  Company has shown revenue growth of nearly 25% and 33% in FY 2006 and Q1FY2007 as compared to corresponding periods last year. Cash flows can just satisfy its current needs. Cash on books is low and can't support any big acquisition. Valuation/Offer value ($ In million) (Company may not be able to perform this well - chances of company performing this well: 40%) Assuming that nothing negative happens with the company and it performs exceptionally well and without considering effect of declining dollar: 1. 25% rise in revenue year on year in FY 2007 and FY 2008 from $631 million in FY 2006 to $766 million in FY 2007 and $958 million in FY 2008. 2. Gross margins rise by 1% to 42% 3. Net margins rise by 3% to 10% This leaves the company with operating profit of $77 million and $96 million in FY 2007 and FY 2008 respectively and after detecting interest cost of nearly $12 and $15 and income tax cost of $8 & $9, this leave company with net profit of $57 million and $73 million, that is EPS of $ 0.28 and $ 0.35 for FY 07 and FY 08 respectively.  This means that even if the company performs exceptionally well, at an offer price of $17 the company's share is selling at one year forward PE of nearly 61 and two year forward PE of nearly 49.     We rate this IPO 1- on scale of ""1 to 5"" (5 is best) Negatives   Positives"

(NYSE:GDDY) has long been penalized by the market, concerned over the apps ecosystem eating away the website ecosystem, especially for e-commerce and other major categories. On the contrary, the company has successfully hopped on to a growth trajectory, with help from the explosive growth in e-commerce and strong execution on the part of the management.The stock was part of our weekly list of favorite Long and Short candidates. Mostly because as we updated our numbers from the recent quarterly results of the company as well as other major tech peers, it is apparent that the company is moving faster than earlier expected towards its '4-1-1' goal for 2022, i.e. $4 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in unlevered free cash flow.While the broader economy is holding back, GoDaddy's go-getter CEO is playing offense, making good of a resurgent industry that is experiencing a secular shift towards online commerce, gaining share, expanding its product offerings, and acquiring strategically important businesses that can deliver more than just vertical expansion.The market continues to ignore GoDaddy as little more than a domain registry and shrug it off as a business lacking long-term growth, a big reason why the market hasn't rewarded GoDaddy with richer trading multiple.That viewpoint is myopic and wrong. The recent fight between Epic Games (publisher of Fortnite) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) boycott by advertisers has highlighted how corporates are waking up to problems about getting locked in an ecosystem, including an app, which is leading to a resurgence in owning websites where they can control their message and branding. Indeed, Purnha is also an attempt to do the same.As covered in detail in our previous notes on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Sprout Social (NASDAQ:SPT), consistent growth in online commerce and availability of platforms like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and BigCommerce (NASDAQ:BIGC) has led to an increasing number of merchants building in-house online sales rather than just relying on third-party platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The success of GoDaddy's value-addition efforts is visible in the strong growth of its Websites + Marketing business that saw ARR growth of 60% during the second quarter. The company's commerce tier, which allows a user to build their e-commerce websites with ready tools for $25 per month, grew 90% over last year, highlighting the demand from new entrepreneurs.GoDaddy's long-term strategic vision. Purnha's source: GoDaddy PresentationAs the chart above shows, the company is moving towards growing its total available market by providing more value-added services carrying higher customer spend. So the key is to continue to grow the customer base and sell more lucrative service offering to this growing customer base.And the company is moving faster on this goal, adding 400,000 customers during the previous quarter, an increase of 200% over last year, bringing the company's total paying customers count to 20 million.In an environment when most companies refused to provide any type of forecast, the company has stuck with the guidance, and an impressive one indeed, revenue growth of 10% and unlevered free cash flow of $825 million for the year. But the guidance may be proven conservative if we look at some of the product expansion efforts.By adding new features and functionalities, including more marketing tools, video streaming, security options, and bulk purchase experiences, growing ease of use of the products is introducing the products to ever-bigger markets.At the same time, free offers are widening the front door, inviting more customers to give it a try. The company has been adding more services offerings as part of this 'freemium' offering, which is proving quite successful in a growing market.Acquisitions starting to contributeThe company has made three acquisitions this year - Over, Neustar's registry business and Uniregistry, and contributions, both financial and strategic, should be evident to the investors over the coming months.Uniregistry has already been clubbed to form the GoDaddy Corporate Domains teams. Full functionality of Over is also embedded in the website + marketing offerings and early results are visible, with the pace of user growth doubling sequentially to 1.7 million users engaging on the platform.Acquisition of Neustar's registry business is already closed and even though the financial contribution from the business is expected to be small this year, contribution to vertical integration with the existing domain business and new product development from the business should be apparent to investors over the coming months.  GoDaddy Inc.       CAGR 2015-19   Revenue 17%   Gross Profit 17%   Technology and development 14%   Marketing and advertising 14%   Customer care 12%   General and Admin 11%   Adjusted EBITDA 35%  As the chart above shows, the company has been able to deliver pretty meaningful improvement to the margins over the last five years, highlighting the existing leverage in the business model.With customer acquisition costs coming down, the company restructuring its U.S. outbound sales team, and synergies from the recent acquisitions coming through, margin and cash flow numbers should get a boost.Disclosure: Before writing a note, we usually ask (via Twitter and Stocktwits) for things readers would like us to cover in the note, please do share your views for our next note.

The company has been using the current crisis conditions to restructure its operations and financial position. The market is pleased with the actions it is taking.GoDaddy's Q2 revenues grew 9.4% to $806.4 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $798 million. Total bookings improved 10.7% over the year to $936.3 million. Non-GAAP loss was $4.06 per share, which was significantly worse than the market's estimates of an EPS of $0.17. The increased loss was on account of GoDaddy settling its Termination and Release Agreement (TRA) obligation with KKR for a one-time payment of $850 million compared with an estimated $1.8 billion payout over the next 10+ years.By segment, revenues from the Domain segment grew 10.5% to $369.6. Hosting and Presence revenues improved 4.4% to $292.2 million due to higher subscriptions to Websites and Marketing. Business Applications revenues grew 17.6% to $144.6 million due to an increase in workspace renewals.For the current quarter, GoDaddy forecast revenues of $835 million compared with the market's estimates of $793.74 million. It expects double-digit growth in its Domains segment, mid-single-digit growth in its Hosting and Presence segment, and high-teens growth in Business Applications.GoDaddy is making significant improvements in its businesses that are seeing improvements across various metrics. First, it crossed the milestone of 20 million paying customers. During the quarter, it added over 400,000 customers, making this one of the strongest quarter of net customer growth in more than 20 years. The growth was driven by stable retention rates and record gross customer adds in the quarter. GoDaddy believes that both of these trends were not only due to the higher market demand for online presence but also due to GoDaddy's investments in marketing.Second, it continued to add several new features and functionality to its products. Some of the new features added include newer marketing tools, video streaming, security options, and bulk purchase experiences. It is leveraging the acquisition of Uniregistry that it made earlier this year to build a GoDaddy Corporate Domains team that is able to deliver new functionalities for bulk purchasers. It is already seeing strength in primary domain sales, domain add-on, and aftermarket transactions through these efforts. GoDaddy is also allowing its customers to use and experiment its products by adding a freemium experience. In the first quarter of the year, it had released the freemium capabilities for its Websites + Marketing offering. Last quarter, it added Sellbrite e-commerce to the freemium portfolio.Third, it took several actions focused on long-term growth and cash flow generation. In June this year, it restructured its US outbound sales team in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The sales team was not able to deliver on its sales targets due to the crisis, and it made financial sense to reduce the team. Overall, GoDaddy has restructured 814 employees at a charge of $15 million for the year.GoDaddy's stock is trading at $79.04 with a market capitalization of $13.3 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $85.46 in June this year. GoDaddy had fallen to a 52-week low of $40.25 in March this year when most stocks fell.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

As a global leader in web hosting and domain registration, GoDaddy will continue to create shareholder value in months to come. The ongoing pandemic will have no negative effects on the company's financials, and with more than $800 million in liquidity and an ability to get an additional $600 million from the credit facility, GoDaddy has enough resources to continue to grow. Since the company's debt starts to mature only in 2024, GoDaddy decided to approve a $500 million stock repurchase program, which is a positive thing, considering that it has enough time to cover its debt. In Q2, GoDaddy has every chance to beat its conservative guidance and generate positive FCF. With a forward P/E of 17.99x, I view GoDaddy as a 'BUY', and recently, I opened a long position in the company.As a leader in domain registration and web hosting, GoDaddy is an attractive company to own. Its stock has already recovered from the March selloff, and it has every chance to appreciate in the upcoming months. COVID-19 will have no negative impact on the company's financials, and the latest earnings report for Q1 shows that GoDaddy will thrive in the current environment. In the first quarter of the year, the company's bookings increased by 9% Y/Y to $951 million, while its revenues and unlevered FCF showed double-digit growth. All of the company's major sources of income like domains, hosting, and business applications showed top-line growth during the period and are expected to continue to generate value in Q2.Source: GoDaddyGoDaddy is also a much safer company to own in comparison to its competitors like Shopify (SHOP) and Wix (WIX), which trade at irrational exuberance levels with a forward P/E of over 200x. With a forward P/E of only 17.99x, GoDaddy also trades below the stocks from the S&P 500 Index, which has an average forward P/E of 25x.Source: Yahoo Finance. The table was created by the authorIn the current environment, there's going to be an increased demand for online products and services, as businesses and entrepreneurs already begin to expand their presence on the internet due to a pandemic. This is undoubtedly a positive development for GoDaddy, considering that it has the biggest market share in the web hosting business and is the largest domain registrar in the world. After experiencing an increased amount of renewals for web hosting and domains in Q1, we could safely assume that the company will continue to benefit from the transition to remote work.With an addressable TAM of $180 billion, GoDaddy, with a revenue of less than $1 billion per quarter, has lots of upsides. To increase shareholder value, GoDaddy has been actively leveraging its popularity among businesses by selling additional various products and services like branded emails and marketing tools that increase engagement. In Q1, it collaborated with WooCommerce to help entrepreneurs bring their products and services on one of the most popular website engines WordPress. It also recently acquired Neustar, which is an analytics platform, to improve its analytical capabilities and create customized offerings for its clients by studying their behavior on its website.Source: GoDaddyBy having $851 million in cash and an ability to obtain an additional $600 million from its credit facility, GoDaddy has enough resources to fund its growth. While its debt stands at $2.6 billion, there are no debt maturities up until 2024, so the company has enough time not to worry about any liquidity crisis in the foreseeable future. Considering this, GoDaddy recently announced a new $500 million share repurchase program, which is the right thing to do, considering that the company is growing, and we are going to have a low interest rate environment in the next couple of years.By having a leadership team with a proven track record of success, investors of GoDaddy shouldn't worry about the future of the business. In the past decade, the company generated a positive FCF, and its unlevered FCF has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 19%. The company should be able to achieve its goal of $4 billion in revenue in 2022, and the pandemic will give its earnings a boost in the next few quarters.Source: GoDaddyThe biggest risk for GoDaddy is competition. In recent years, both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) started to aggressively expand their web hosting and domain registry solutions through Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Both of those companies have more resources for expansion and in the long term, they will become a greater threat to GoDaddy. However, in the short to near term, GoDaddy is safe. The retention rate of 85% shows that GoDaddy has established a strong foothold in the industry, and it will not lose customers to its competitors in a foreseeable future.For Q2, GoDaddy expects its revenues to be $790 million, which I think is too conservative, considering that, in Q1, the business generated $792 million in revenue, even though the country was shut down only at the end of March. Since everyone was online from April to May, GoDaddy shouldn't have any problems beating its guidance when it reports its Q2 results next week. As the street estimates GoDaddy's earnings per share to grow in the next couple of years, I decided to open a long position in the company and have no interest in closing it anytime soon. Thanks to its unique market positioning and a dominant market share in web hosting and domain registry, GoDaddy's business will thrive in years to come.Source: Seeking Alpha"
4340060,105526,2020-04-26T15:54:21-04:00,"GoDaddy's investor day reinforces my bullish stance on the long-term outlook.Beyond the near-term COVID impact, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on a sizable TAM and an extensive growth runway.Excess cash allows GoDaddy to capitalize on M&A opportunities, or repurchase more shares.15x FCF multiple on 2021 numbers should get the stock to $80, with room for further upside if the multiple returns to pre-COVID levels.","I've always viewed GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) favorably, given its industry-leading position as the largest registrar, as well as its capital-light business model, both of which have allowed the company to compound capital at impressive rates historically. The GoDaddy ecosystem is highly sticky, with its strong brand awareness creating a low-cost funnel for volumes of new customers, and its best-in-class customer service driving retention. For investors, this means highly attractive user economics, with an extensive cash flow growth runway going forward. The recent investor day only reinforced my conviction in the stock, with a multi-billion-dollar addressable market (TAM) at hand, including over 500m small-medium businesses worldwide. Assuming GDDY retains a conservative 15x FCF multiple, I see shares trading up to $80. A reversion toward a 20x FCF multiple should see shares trade closer toward $105.Looking to Q1, management has guided toward minimal impact (less than $5M), as COVID-related disruption did not hit until later in the quarter. The core business (~75% of bookings) remains resilient, with renewals also on track, though there is some offset from softness in new sales. The Q2 guide includes a larger $25-30mn impact from lower sales productivity, as the customer care team (generating ~16% of bookings) shifts toward working remotely (instead of at a call center). The remaining impact stems from a hit to demand for higher-priced products in the GoDaddy portfolio. From the investor day call:Unsurprisingly, management pulled the FY20 guide on COVID-related uncertainty. Although management suspended 2020 guidance and lowered 2Q revenue by $25-$30 million, there was some silver lining for investors, as churn is not expected to go through a material churn. Given most of the company's subscriber base is on annual plans, with a relatively low price point ($13-$15/month), this makes sense to me, though the ARPU growth outlook will also likely be scaled back.Source: Company DataLonger-term, however, assuming historical retention rates hold, GoDaddy expects to generate ~$25 billion of revenue from existing cohorts over the next eight years. Looking past the distortions from COVID-19 in 2020, management has guided toward 2022 revenue reaching $4 billion and FCF of $1.1 billion (dubbed the ""4-1-1""). The company's 4-1-1 goal strikes me as a useful framework for thinking about its long-term financial opportunity, with the implied double-digit revenue growth and FCF margin expansion clearly supporting the bull case.Source: Investor PresentationOf particular note was the updated GDDY estimate of a total long-term total addressable market (TAM) at $350bn, of which it is actively addressing $180bn via offerings across the following - $5bn in Dream (domains), $45bn in Create (online presence and e-mail) and $130bn in Grow (marketing, commerce, and consumer engagement).Source: Investor PresentationInterestingly, creating an attachment to additional services (beyond domain drives) is set to be the key driver behind some dramatic increases in customer value. For example, relative to just a domain-only customer, domain+e-mail generates 9x the value, domain+website generates 11x the value, and domain+website+e-mail generates 27x the value.Source: Investor PresentationOne of the key selling points for GoDaddy is its 85% customer retention rate and a 90% annual revenue rate, both of which facilitate a highly predictable revenue stream. Thus far, improvements in usage and adoption have come in tandem with expanding retention rates. For instance, GDDY posted a 1.3x increase in publish rate from 63% to 84%, leading to a 1.4x improvement in retention rate.Source: Investor PresentationLooking past COVID-19, and assuming historical retention rates hold, GoDaddy is well-positioned to generate a cumulative ~$25 billion in revenue from its existing cohorts over the next eight years. Note that GoDaddy's 2008 cohort has generated $1.5 billion in bookings over the last 12 years, and its 2010 cohort has delivered $800+ million in contribution margin to date on $1.6 billion in bookings, resulting in a whopping 10x return on its 2010 marketing spend.Source: Investor PresentationThe company is cash-rich, allowing it to remain in a strong liquidity position despite the current macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, the company has over $1bn of cash, $600m undrawn on its revolver, and less than 2x net leverage, with no significant debt maturities until 2024. With the targeted leverage ratio at 2x-4x, this will allow $3bn in cumulative unlevered free cash flow generation through 2022.Source: Investor PresentationI think these targets could prove conservative going forward, as GoDaddy's cash and leverage ratio look set to improve substantially in 2020, assuming the FCF growth guidance of +14% YoY still holds. This would imply $840m in unlevered FCF generation in 2020, which would drive $1.3bn in cash by next year, assuming repurchases are maintained.Source: Projections and Estimates Based on Company DataThe excess cash leaves the door open for GoDaddy to drive inorganic growth via M&A at a time when targets are likely available at depressed valuations. A glance at GoDaddy's recent deals has pointed toward an appetite for tuck-ins. The likes of Over, Uniregistry, and Brandsight, all of which were acquired earlier this year, support GoDaddy's existing offerings, from the websites and marketing products to the core Domains business.Meanwhile, the Neustar acquisition further diversifies GoDaddy's Domains business, allowing it to tap into the wholesale market for country-code top-level domains (TLDs), a high-growth market that has generally outpaced the dot-com TLDs.Alternatively, the excess cash could go toward capital return. GDDY has committed to deploying 80% of available capital, equivalent to around $3.5bn, over the next three years into M&A and share buybacks. Thus far, GDDY has repurchased ~5% of diluted equity since the last earnings call, with plenty of room for further repurchases. Management repurchased $460m worth of shares in 2019 and has generally been prudent with its capital allocation decisions.Source: Company DataFrom a valuation perspective, shares are trading at or near trough multiples and, thus, seem attractive to me relative to historical valuations.Data by YChartsThis largely reflects the increased risks of downward revisions by the Street in line with the COVID impact, though at a trough FCF multiple, strong cash generation, and an extensive double-digit growth runway, I like the mean reversion trade on GDDY shares. Even assuming GDDY continues to command a 15.0x FCF multiple, this gets me to a price target of $80. Further multiple expansion to 20x FCF could see shares trade to $105."
4339385,102000,2020-04-23T09:02:15-04:00,"GoDaddy doesn't pay a dividend, but you can extract cash from it.Sell naked, or cash-secured, puts against the stock.If put to you, you get it at a value price and collect an effective dividend from the put premium.","There are lots of ways to generate hedges or income by using options, but we like selling naked (or cash-secured) puts against value stocks. The advantage of this strategy is that, if a stock is put to us, we not only get it at a value price, but have collected some premium in the process.This differs from selling naked puts against any old stock that happens to be volatile and thus has a high premium. Collecting, say, $4,000 on a naked put sale for a stock that can move 40 points in a day is a sure way to lose money.We are investors, not gamblers. That requires a disciplined approach towards selling naked puts.There are certain businesses with limited competition, and that is always attractive to investors. Limited competition is the result of having first-mover advantage, enough capital for marketing and expansion, being able to operate in a complicated space because of some expertise, or just refusing to say die.Domain registration is one such industry. In the early days of the internet, the stock market went wild for companies like Network Solutions because of its domain registration business.Today, there are some 368 registrars, but functionally only about 250. The top ten account for 67% of all registrations. Of those, a division of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) holds the top spot with a 15.7% market share.In second place is the only publicly traded effectively pure play registrar, GoDaddy.com (GDDY), at 9.5%. People will always need to register domain names, and as the number and type of suffixes increase, it will only lead to more registrations.The internet has become essential, and that’s why domain registration has also become essential. It will likely never go away.GoDaddy is also #1 in market share in web hosting, with 15.5%, far ahead of all other competitors. Not only that, GoDaddy is a very good business.GDDY stock was sold off from $77 per share all the way down to $42 at its nadir - more than 45%. It has since recovered to $67 as of Monday. And yet, we still like GDDY at this price because it meets our value stock valuation metric as it is a GARP stock.GDDY stock trades at 100x TTM diluted EPS of $0.76, so we understand why people might thing we are crazy. Let’s explain.What do we consider a GARP stock? Does GDDY stock qualify?For our valuation methods, a GARP stock is one that meets the following criteria:1) Profitable2) Free Cash Flow growing at 20%+ annually3) Long-term debt that can be repaid within 3 years using cash and FCF over that period4) 5-year PEG ratio up to 3.505) Limited competitive fieldGrowth stocks obviously tend to trade at premium multiples because of the expectation of an accelerated earnings growth rate. Yet, most of these may not even be earning a net profit!GDDY has been making a profit since FY17, and even better, it generates enormous free cash flow because it has such little overhead. The company is very similar in that regard to Booking Holdings (BKNG).A look at GDDY’s annual operating and free cash flow shows they have been constantly increasing. FCF grew from $100 million in FY13 to $737 million in FY19. That’s incredible growth - a seven-fold increase in seven years.Not only that, GDDY has $1.1 billion in cash and investments and only $2.4 billion in debt. The company could pay off all its debt in about two years if it so desired.This is a very healthy business pegged to grow EPS 50% next year and 30% annually for the next five years on average. GDDY thus has a PEG ratio of 3.3. The company meets our criteria.There are risks to be aware of when selling naked puts and for GDDY in general.The company must keep up with competition in terms of pricing and services. Competitors may offer value-added services that consumers value more than GDDY’s, and GDDY may lose market share.Consumer behavior and evolving technologies may completely change how websites are registered and utilized, significantly affecting the company’s business.Registration and hosting are effectively commodities. That can result in thin margins and fierce competition. GDDY may not be able to maintain its top position, or could get into price wars that harm revenue and net income.The company may not be able to keep up with international expansion as effectively as competitors. While international bookings represent 33% of GDDY business (per 10-K, page 25), it may not be able to expand effectively.What puts can we sell with GDDY stock at $64 as of Tuesday’s close?The June $57.50 puts are going for about $2.70 each. Earning more than 4.8% in about 8 weeks is a generous premium, as it is usually about half that. If put to you, you will be buying GDDY stock at the equivalent of $54.80 per share, which is about a 15% discount from even this low price.For those who want to wait a little bit longer to see how the economy shakes out, the August $55 puts are also going for about $3.75. If put to you, you will be buying GDDY stock at the equivalent of $51.25 per share, a discount of more than 20% from this point.Finally, for the most conservative choice, January’s $50 puts sell of about $4 per share. You would earn 8% on your money, but in the process, you’d be hedging your GDDY stock bet all the way down to $46 per share - near its recent panic low."

We expect these stocks to continue to underperform.,"This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.In August 2018 and September 2018, we introduced investors to the concept of “Micro-Bubbles”. These small groups of stocks pose extraordinary risk within an overall market that is not nearly as overvalued. We deemed these stocks as overvalued because their valuations assumed they would take significant market share away from the highly profitable incumbents in their industries. As seen in Figure 1, six of the seven micro-bubble stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 (outperformed as shorts) since our original reports.Figure 1: All Seven Micro-Bubble Picks Outperform as ShortsWe recently pointed out that TSLA, NFLX, AMZN, and CRM remain overvalued. This week, we’ll focus on two more Micro-Bubble stocks that remain overvalued. We expect these stocks to continue to underperform. Dropbox (DBX) and GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY) are back in the Danger Zone.We first picked Dropbox as a micro-bubble stock on September 10, 2018. Since we published our report, DBX has outperformed as a short and is down 14%, while the S&P 500 is up 2%. Additionally, Microsoft (MSFT) – which we picked as a micro-bubble winner vs. DBX – is up 25%, per Figure 2.Figure 2: DBX Underperforms MSFT and the S&P 500 Since September 2018Dropbox faces a clear disadvantage versus MSFT and other major competitors. The company charges for a product, cloud storage, that its much larger competitors can offer for free, or at much lower prices. This competition and lack of pricing power manifests in Dropbox’s after-tax profit (NOPAT) margins, which are highly negative since going public, and currently sit at -20%.Furthermore, while the company has revamped its service offerings and even restructured its pricing plans, these actions haven’t been able to reverse the decelerating revenue and user growth. DBX’s revenue grew 26% year-over-year (YoY) in 2018, which is down from 31% in 2017 and 40% in 2016. Similarly, paying users grew 15% YoY in 2018, down from 25% and 35% in 2017 and 2016 respectively.While the company boasts over 500 million users, just 13.2 million were paying users at the end of 1Q19. The costs Dropbox incurs to acquire these users and build competitive services take the company even further away from profitability. Since 2015, revenue has grown 32% compounded annually while research & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing costs have grown by 56%, 38% and 32% compounded annually.Our dynamic DCF model demonstrates the exceedingly optimistic market share and cash flow growth expectations that are baked into Dropbox’s stock price.Dropbox’s current valuation of $20/share implies the firm will achieve a long-term NOPAT margin of 7% (above competitor Amazon (AMZN), but below Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft), and grow revenue by 22% compounded annually for 13 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.In this scenario, Dropbox would be generating $18.4 billion in revenue, which, at current per user averages ($118 in 2018), implies the firm would have over 156 million paying users. For reference, DBX had just 13.2 million paying users as of March 31, 2019. Microsoft’s Office 365, which provides access to Microsoft’s OneDrive, had 34.8 million consumer subscribers as of June 30, 2019 and 180 million commercial users as of March 31, 2019 (last time Microsoft provided updated commercial user numbers).Essentially, this scenario implies DBX will grow its user base to near Microsoft levels, all while drastically improving margins and fighting off pricing pressure from deeper-pocketed competitors like Microsoft and many others.Figure 3 compares the revenue growth implied by DBX’s stock price and the consensus estimates for the firm to its short history as a public company. We assume the consensus estimate for revenue growth in estimated year two (15%) continues in each year thereafter. This assumption may prove optimistic, given DBX’s slowing revenue growth rate. Figure 3 clearly illustrates the disconnect between what analysts believe the company can actually achieve and the expectations baked into the stock price.The current valuation of the stock price implies that Dropbox will grow revenue to $18.4 billion, which for reference, is nearly double software provider Adobe’s (ADBE) TTM revenue and nearly triple Intuit’s (INTU) TTM revenue.Figure 3: Dropbox: Historical and Market-Implied Revenue vs. Consensus EstimatesFigure 4 compares the NOPAT growth implied by DBX’s stock price to its historical results.Figure 4: Dropbox: Historical and Market-Implied NOPATEven after falling 14% since our original Micro-Bubble article and underperforming the market, DBX is still overvalued.Even if DBX can achieve 6% NOPAT margins (compared to -20% TTM) and grow revenue by 22% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $13/share today – a 35% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.This scenario (and the one above) also assume DBX is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, DBX’s invested capital has increased 34% since 2016.We first picked GoDaddy as a micro-bubble stock on September 10, 2018. Since we published our report, GDDY has outperformed as a short and is down 14%, while the S&P 500 and GOOGL (the micro-bubble winner) are up 2%, per Figure 5.Figure 5: GDDY Underperforms GOOGL and the S&P 500 Since September 2018GoDaddy generates 46% of its revenue from the sale of its domain products, such as domain name registration, a commoditized (and slowing) business. According to Verisign’s Domain Name Industry Brief, domain name registrations across all top level domains grew by an average of 5% a year over the past four years, compared to an average of 9% a year over the prior four year period. This industry-wide slowdown is a headwind for all domain name registration providers.To diversify its business, GoDaddy expanded into providing website creation/editing applications. However, this industry is also growing more commoditized as numerous new competitors enter the market with, often, free services. GoDaddy is also not the leader in website creation, which makes long-term profitability more difficult. According to Datanyze, which calculates market share for web technologies, Squarespace is the leader in website building with a 22% market share. Wix is second with 20%, and GoDaddy is third with 14% of the market.In a commoditized business, firms can stand out by offering special features and services, or providing value that competitors lack. However, many different reviews note that GoDaddy’s site builder is overly simplified, lacks standard features of a website builder, and provides limited customization and editing capabilities.Product integration (domain and site building) can create cross-selling opportunities, or a way to bring in more new customers, if executed well. GoDaddy has only grown total customers in the mid-single digits (with the exception of 2017, when they acquired 1.6 million through the acquisition of HEG), which is far below the expected level of growth baked into the stock price.GoDaddy’s current valuation of $66/share implies the firm will achieve a NOPAT margin of 10% (above competitor Web.com before it was acquired in 2018, compared to 6% TTM) and grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for nine years. In this scenario, GDDY earns $13.7 billion in revenue in year nine, which equates to over 92 million customers at 2018’s average revenue per user of $148. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.This scenario implies the firm can grow customers by 20% compounded annually over the next nine years (double the growth rate since 2014), while also nearly doubling margins.Figure 6 compares the revenue growth implied by GDDY’s valuation and the consensus estimates for the firm to the historical results of the company since 2013. We assume the consensus estimate for revenue growth in estimated year two (11%) continues in each year thereafter. This assumption may prove optimistic, given GDDY’s slowing revenue growth rate. Figure 6 clearly illustrates the disconnect between what analysts believe the company can achieve and the expectations baked into the stock price.Figure 6: GoDaddy: Market-Implied Revenue vs. Consensus EstimatesFigure 7 compares the NOPAT growth implied by GDDY’s stock price to its historical results.Figure 7: GoDaddy: Historical and Market-Implied NOPATEven after falling 10% since our original Micro-Bubble article in September 2018, GDDY Is still up over 72% over the past two years and remains overvalued.Even if GDDY can maintain current NOPAT margins (6%) and grow NOPAT by 20% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $45/share today – a 32% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.This scenario (and the one above) also assume GDDY is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, GDDY’s invested capital has increased 45% since 2013.Investors that want to bet against these micro-bubble stocks can short them directly, but that strategy can be expensive and risky for these noise-driven companies.Another way to profit from the bursting of this micro-bubble is to invest in the incumbents from which these companies must take major chunks of market share just to meet the market’s current expectations. When these micro bubble stocks fall back to earth, a great deal of capital should be reallocated to the incumbents. We covered some of the micro-bubble winners here.A few new features are shaping the market now and explain why today’s micro bubbles are unlikely to spread to the entire market and create a macro bubble, at least for the foreseeable future:These modern-day, micro bubbles reflect the zero-sum nature of today’s crowded and more mature competitive landscapes.This article originally published on August 5, 2019.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.(1) Shiller, Robert J., et al. “Stock Prices and Social Dynamics.” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 1984, no. 2, 1984, pp. 457–510.

The only familiarity with the company came from almost a decade of racy TV ads. And some ads that were pushed online because TV stations refused to air them at all. But the more we dug, the more we came away impressed. GoDaddy has built a fantastic business with strong revenue growth, cash flows, and growth opportunities looking forward.In this article, we will look at GoDaddy's business in more detail, assess its growth opportunities, review potential catalysts, and show what valuation inputs we use to arrive at our $137 price target.At a high level, GoDaddy is a high return and high organic growth business trading at what we believe to be a significant discount to fair value. This valuation decline has been happening for a while but accelerated recently and does not align with the fundamentals of the business:(Source: FactSet)GoDaddy now trades at just 14x P/FCF or 0.6x that of the S&P 500 with 20% CF ROIC and double digit organic earnings & FCF growth. On a relative basis, it is now at its cheapest relative to the S&P 500 on P/FCF since its IPO. We prefer P/FCF whenever practical, but it is especially relevant for GoDaddy given GoDaddy's high D&A and minimal Capex.This valuation decline comes at a time when the business is performing well and barely missed a beat through COVID-19 on revenue/cash flow estimates and expected growth remains in the double digits:(Source: FactSet)(Source: FactSet)In fact, 2Q20 saw bookings up 11% and net adds up over 200% YoY. This makes sense as GoDaddy is tied to the growth of online services and ecommerce, and COVID-19 only accelerated that trend.Beyond being a COVID-19 beneficiary, GoDaddy has another recent catalyst that we believe will result in the shares re-rating. While we will go into more detail on it later, the catalyst is the Settlement/Removal of the TRA agreement that was just announced last month. Not to mention 2Q20 operating results that were well ahead of expectations.GoDaddy is targeting organically reaching $1.1bn of unlevered-FCF in 2022, which translates to $1.0bn of normal FCF in 2022. We don't like using unlevered FCF for the simple fact that GoDaddy does have leverage. The $1.0bn of FCF comes out to ~$6.50 per share in 2022 with a small amount of buybacks. Applying a 21x FCF multiple (0.9x the S&P 500's P/FCF) to $6.50 of FCF per share implies a price of $137, or nearly double Monday's (9/21/2020) close of $73.51.That is the core thesis in a nutshell. The rest of the article will discuss in more detail GoDaddy's core business, reasons why it is growing double digits organically, why that can continue, and lastly the catalyst and timing opportunity.GoDaddy has three main business segments: Domains, Hosting and Presence (H&P), and Business Application. A consolidated look at each segments size and historical trajectory:(Source: Company Filings & Author Compilation)DomainsDomains has been GoDaddy's core product since inception and makes up ~45% of total revenue. Here GoDaddy allows its customers to claim a desired website as their own. This can happen either by the customer registering an un-used domain, or the customer buying the rights to use a domain that someone else has already claimed for their own. GoDaddy, for a fee, is the leader in both registering new domains for customers and procuring existing domains through an auction process. It is a pretty straightforward business where scale and brand name are important.GoDaddy has been the only game in town in this business for over 15 years. It earned market-leading scale and brand awareness and never looked back. In 2019, GoDaddy was estimated to have over 22% of global domain registrations, and as many as the next top 10 players combined.Domains financial results have been nothing if not steady. Over the past 5 years, Domains has grown at a 12.6% CAGR with every year's growth between +10% to +15%.(Source: Company Filings & Author Compilation)This 10%+ mostly organic growth is really a function of three things: Increasing number of websites created, market share, and pricing. Number of websites created has been growing ~4% and is expected to maintain that growth going forward. Market share has been growing slowly, adding ~1-2%. And lastly pricing has been growing ~5%. Add these together and you get the 10% number. We see all three continuing at similar growth rates going forward.Pricing averages $17 per domain per year, so while the 5% increase may seem like a lot it actually is only 85 cents per year. That can continue at a similar pace or faster for a decade before it totals to more than a few dollars per year. Below see total .com and .net domain name base growth (From Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN)) and GoDaddy pricing per domain per year:(Source: Verisign Investor Presentation)(Source: GoDaddy Investor Presentation)Hosting and PresenceHosting & Presence (H&P) is the ""next level"" of GoDaddy's services. H&P offers tools to design, edit, manage, host website data on servers, provide security, help with marketing, and search engine optimization.While these services are essential, there are many options for which company to choose. GoDaddy historically was lagging in this department in terms of service, but over the past few years significantly improved its offerings and ease of use. With that has come high-teens revenue growth and a #3 market position. GoDaddy's offering here is called GoCentral. The other top two website design/build players are Squarespace and Wix.com (WIX):(Source: Datanyze)(Source: Company Filings & Author Compilation)Don't let the chart scare you RE the revenue growth decline in this segment. It is important to note that GoDaddy recently launched out multiple new products within Website + Marketing (W+M), especially in the ecommerce area. In order to gain traction and market share these products were launched as ""Freemium"" products. That has slowed revenue growth, but adoption and net customer adds hit all-time highs in 2Q20. Net adds were up over 200% from last year in 2Q20.Eventually, GoDaddy will have to convert these free members into paying members or do away with the Freemium model and charge everyone. But for right now gaining traction and a critical mass of users is more important, and even with the Freemium launch revenue remains in the mid-single digit range.According to IBIS World, the overall Website Design services industry grew at a 6.5% CAGR between 2015 - 2020. Going forward the outlook is no less robust, and we expect GoDaddy to outgrow the industry as it takes market share with new products it did not previously offer.(Source: GoDaddy Investor Presentation)In addition GoDaddy has significant pricing room going forward. According to this chart from Goldman below, if GoDaddy can get even 1/3 of their products cross-sold to each customer, that would imply an Average Revenue Per Subscriber (company-wide, but most of the delta comes from this segment) of ~$500 vs. $200 today. If they can achieve that gradually over the next 10 years, that would still equate to an ARPU CAGR of almost 10%, companywide. (Note a few of the products in the below chart fall under the Business Applications segment.) Adding it all together this segment can grow mid-teens organically for a long time. (Source: Goldman Sachs Research)Although it may seem obvious that having a highly functional and professional looking website is important, while doing our research we came across the following interesting stats that should underscore the importance of these services to businesses:Lastly, GoDaddy's smallest but fastest growing segment is Business Applications. This segment includes integrated services tied to running a business/online business. Examples: Email addresses specific to your website's domain, Microsoft Office 365 integrated into the website including contacts and calendars automatically synced via what happens on the website, personalized email marketing, internet-based telephone services and automated customer service lines run through your cellphone, etc.All of these services are meant to be natural extensions of services that a new business or newly created online presence for an existing business would need. In addition to growing the fastest now, this segment has the largest TAM estimated at $130bn.In the past 5 years, Business Applications has grown at a 30% CAGR. This growth has slowed a little bit due to the laws of large numbers, but remains healthy in the high-teens. In 2015 Business Applications was 11% of total and in 2019 it was 17% of total.(Source: Company Filings & Author Compilation)Looking forward GoDaddy believes Business Applications has the largest TAM and ability to grow. Although there is some overlap between Create/Grow and H&P/Business Applications, generally Domains=Dream, H&P=Create, and Business Applications=Grow:(Source: GoDaddy Investor Presentation)Right now GoDaddy does not offer a Manage product, but expects to launch one in the next few years. Part of the reason the TAM's in H&P and Business Applications are so much larger than Domains is due to pricing. Domains is a great and essential core business, but again its pricing is only $17 per domain per year. These other products have monthly charges in the $5-$15 range per month, and that is for each individual feature desired in many cases: (Source: GoDaddy Investor Presentation)Putting it all together, GoDaddy is expected to grow its topline ~10% organically in the next few years as a blended average of the segments discussed above. The runway for their growth is long, and they are taking market share in pretty much every segment.Add on top of that profitability and substantial free cash flow generation and we believe it checks all the boxes of a good business. There will be some domain licensing expenses that increase, but given how cheap that product is on a dollars per year basis we are confident they will be able to offset any cost increases with price. These businesses are also low capex and highly scalable. As revenue grows, GoDaddy has meaningful operating leverage embedded in the model.Random thought- Why no more racy ads? Those were the brainchild of founder Bob Parsons. Bob is no longer involved in the business; he sold his controlling stake to private equity including KKR and Silver Lake and stepped down as CEO in 2011. In 2018 he left the board completing the severance. Nothing against Bob, but that's a positive as GoDaddy looks to rebrand beyond the traditional domain business and is now a $12bn market cap company. It was time for GoDaddy to grow up beyond bikinis and it did.The removal of the TRA agreement GoDaddy had with its pre-IPO investors is a big catalyst. We won't get into the details of TRA's (for a detailed yet succinct look see here: TRA Explained ) but the high level explanation is starting in 2023 under the now-nullified agreement, GoDaddy was required to pay these owners a portion of its earnings through at least 2028 and likely a few years beyond.Although the amounts were dependent on future performance, the estimated payments were expected to total over $1 billion through 2028 and potentially more after that. In August 2020 GoDaddy announced an agreement with those private equity funds to buy them out of the agreement for $850 million. This $850 million will be funded mainly with new debt.As of 2Q20, GoDaddy had $1.65bn of net debt. If all of the $850mn is added to that, GoDaddy's pro-forma net debt will be $2.5bn. With 2020E EBITDA of $823mn, that results in a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x and very healthy cash flow / debt service metrics. Their target leverage has been between 2.0x - 4.0x and at the end of 2017 following HEG they ran with 4.0x leverage without issue and paid it down to under 2.0x in a few years.The TRA resolution is a major positive for two main reasons. First, the economics of it result in dollar savings to GoDaddy. They paid $850mn to get out of over $1bn of liabilities. While you do have to discount the $1bn, you also have to factor in potential payments above $1bn after 2028 and rates right now are obviously extremely low. JPMorgan estimated that the deal added between $2 - $4 of value per share taking all those factors into account.The deal also removes a major psychological overhang on the shares. It is understandable that you would pay less for a company that is looking at paying $1bn+ of payments of non-defined amounts over the next decade. It was a weight on the shares, but now it is gone. On the day of the announcement, which was also earnings, shares traded as high as +15% on the day before coming back down.Despite outperforming the market by 15% over the next few weeks after it announced better earnings and the TRA Settlement, the shares have given almost all of those gains back in recent market volatility:(Source: FactSet)GoDaddy's recent sell-off is especially enticing given the chart above. Markets are volatile, and this recent bout of volatility punished the strong recent performers and tech stocks especially hard. Yet GoDaddy never participated in the eye-popping increases that many other stocks did, and its absolute valuation remains quite cheap. In other words, GoDaddy was the baby thrown out in the bathwater.First and foremost, we are looking for fundamentals and do not trade on technicals. But technicals can add value on timing & confirming the thesis, especially when multiple ""core"" technical indicators align with the fundamental thesis. In this case we believe that is present and deserves mentioning.First, today the shares bounced off the daily 200 day moving average with authority on a big market down-day:(Source: Stockcharts.com)Second, on a weekly basis the shares bounced of their 50 week moving average right when they needed to: (Source: Stockcharts.com)And lastly, zooming the weekly chart out to 5 years shows that the shares have been completely range-bound for over 2.5 years. Over this time revenue, earnings, and cash flows have grown nicely and as we displayed above compressing valuation has been what has kept the shares range-bound.With the removal of the TRA overhang and continued strong cash flow growth we expect GoDaddy will break above this range in a meaningful way in the not too distant future. This is one of the most simple yet useful long-term charts: (Source: Stockcharts.com)As described in the Executive Summary page our price target for GoDaddy is $137 in the next year. We reach that by taking the consensus 2022 Free Cash Flow estimate for GoDaddy of $1bn or $6.50 per share, and applying a 21x P/FCF multiple to that. Right now the S&P 500's NTM P/FCF multiple is 23.6x, so it equates to a 0.9x relative multiple.Between 2015 and 2019 GoDaddy traded between a 0.8x - 1.1x relative P/FCF multiple to the S&P. 0.9x is in line with history and given GoDaddy's fundamentals seems more than fair. One year from now, 2022 will be the NTM which is why our price target is one year from now.We believe these assumptions are reasonable and there is opportunity for additional upside on both metrics. With the TRA overhang now gone, there is a chance GoDaddy can trade above its old relative multiples. GoDaddy's organic growth and free cash flow also compare more favorable than the ""average"" market name as well, suggesting the multiple should be above 1.0x. And lastly, we see the opportunity for the company to surprise estimates to the upside as the importance of web presence and sophistication have only accelerated due to COVID-19. 2Q results showed an early glimpse at that but the best should be yet to come."

It did not make matters better when it announced that its CEO Scott Wagner was stepping down.GoDaddy's Q2 revenues grew 13% over the year to $737 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $735.4 million. Net loss came in at $12.6 million compared with a net income of $18.1 million a year ago. Excluding one-time items, it reported EPS of $0.01, below analysts' estimate of $0.16.By segment, GoDaddy's Domain revenues grew 10% to $334.4 million. Hosting and Presence revenues grew 14% to $279.8 million, and Business Applications revenues grew 20% to $123 million. During the quarter, total bookings grew 12% to $846.1 million.The company's customer base grew 6% over the year to 19 million. Average revenue per user grew 8% over the year to $153.For the third quarter, GoDaddy expects revenues of $755-$765 million, compared with the Street's forecast of $760.5 million. It expects to end the year with revenues of $2.97-$3 billion for the year, compared with the Street's estimate of $2.99 billion.GoDaddy continued to improve its product offering during the quarter, especially for its GoCentral and Managed WordPress services that are driving over 40% growth. It recently introduced a new GoCentral template interface that delivers more flexibility in the website building process. The new interface will allow creators to visualize and deliver content in several different layouts simultaneously. The feature will help builders experiment and adjust their site at any point in time while building the site.To drive its marketing and publishing engine, GoDaddy is expanding its social integration. It already had integrations with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) My Business. It recently added integration capabilities with Instagram.GoDaddy is expanding its partnerships with other technology companies to drive market adoption. Recently, it deployed several of its products such as ProTools into various Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) solutions that will help higher-end WordPress developers using Amazon Lightsail on AWS. Amazon Business Prime members now have access to a free trial for GoCentral and SmartLine as well. It is also integrating its domain platform into AWS so that it will power AWS' new domain registration. Post the integration, GoDaddy will become the domain technology provider for all major public cloud vendors.GoDaddy also entered into a new partnership with Kabbage (KBGE), a provider of real-time small business financing. As part of the agreement, GoDaddy will help its customers get access to financing solutions from Kabbage. Within e-commerce, it expanded its partnership with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) customers to allow them to not only use PayPal as a checkout option but also use the PayPal Commerce Platform for back-end processing of other funding sources such as credit cards.GoDaddy also announced that its CEO of seven years, Scott Wagner, was stepping down for health reasons. He is being replaced by the former President of Brand Expedia Group Aman Bhutani.The market is not very pleased with GoDaddy's progress. Its stock is trading at $63.28 with a market capitalization of $11.3 billion. It touched a high of $84.97 in September last year. Its stock hit a 52-week low of $56.67 in December last year.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4316472,101693,2020-01-13T09:57:02-05:00,"Several Seeking Alpha authors seem to be neutral to bearish on the stock. However, I think this doesn't fit GDDY's fundamentals.In my view, the stock continues to grow its revenues consistently, strengthen its value proposition, and increase its FCF in spite of competitive pressures.To me, this signals that the bearish thesis is likely wrong, and the stock is probably reasonably valued, given the current macroeconomic environment.Consequently, I think it's worth buying GDDY's dips.","Lately, various Seeking Alpha authors have presented interesting bearish points regarding GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY). However, I think that the bull case is much stronger, as it's ultimately backed by consistent top-line growth and strong FCF. Moreover, I see GDDY also as an exciting acquisition target from Amazon (AMZN) or Google (GOOG/GOOGL) due to its strategic position in the web hosting market. And lastly, my valuation approaches seem to justify GDDY's current valuation. Consequently, I believe investors should be long-term bullish on GDDY and buy its future dips.Short-sellers often bring up valid points regarding GDDY's long-term competitive prospects, which raise questions regarding the company's long-term sustainability. For example, other seeking alpha authors have pointed out that GDDY's margins could contract due to competitive pressures against better-capitalized rivals. After all, the domain registration business is more or less undifferentiated. Thus, competitors such as Google and Amazon could very well derail GDDY's promising prospects. Indeed, competing against these tech giants has been incredibly tricky for most companies, and GDDY could suffer the same fate.Source: Seeking Alpha.I will concede that GDDY's business moat isn't as robust as some of its competitors. However, I'd say that the fact that GDDY owns 16.77% of the web hosting market says a lot about the health of its business. This means that the company hosts almost 1.5 million websites, which is almost twice as much as its nearest competitor (United Layer). I don't believe this happens by random chance and is likely a by-product of a compelling value proposition.Source: Datanyze.Moreover, management believes that margins shouldn't change meaningfully for the foreseeable future. This shows GDDY's inherent resiliency in spite of competitive pressures. For example, if VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) increases its prices, GDDY believes it can easily pass it onto its consumers. This is because consumers associate specific domain names with goals and dreams. Accordingly, it should be easy to charge a bit more for the ideal name. This is why GDDY's prices might not be as elastic as bears think.Source: My Best Website Builder. GDDY's Website Builder seems to garner positive reviews from users.Furthermore, GDDY's new CEO, Amanpal Bhutani, is optimistic about the company's prospects. Mr. Bhutani was an Expedia senior executive for almost a decade, so I imagine he brings the marketing experience required to differentiate GDDY's offerings. After all, the online travel market is relatively uniform as well. In particular, I liked how Mr. Bhutani seemed to recognize that GDDY's key to success is their ability to make clients' lives easier through seamless technology. It's promising to see the CEO understand that GDDY's success resides in facilitating their clients' lives. Specifically, Mr. Bhutani mentioned that he'd focus on exploiting GDDY's massive user base through investing in GDDY's technology, platform, and interface.It's also worth mentioning that, Mr. Bhutani estimates that eventually achieving $5 billion in yearly revenues is entirely attainable. For context, GDDY's current revenue run rate is approximately $3 billion. This means that GDDY's revenues should still grow another whopping 66%. If that happens, GDDY's profits should increase proportionally, which would justify a higher valuation.Also, I consider this bullish scenario shows why GDDY could also be a compelling acquisition target. In particular, Amazon and Google could be interested in instantly becoming market leaders in web hosting through a GDDY acquisition. This is why GDDY is also an attractive strategic asset in its market segment. Besides, GDDY's growth strategy already includes M&A. So, either way, its market position will continue to strengthen as it acquires competitors. Therefore it wouldn't surprise me to see GDDY being acquired eventually, which bolsters the bull case for the stock.Source: Datanyze.Currently, GDDY is already operating at slightly better than ""break-even."" Historically, GDDY has been unprofitable, but recently it turned the corner into profitability. Furthermore, the consensus is that profits and revenues will continue trending higher. In my view, this is due to GDDY's cash flows from operations growing faster than their CAPEX.Sources: Author’s elaboration (left image) and TIKR (right image).As you can see, GDDY's CFOs have vastly outpaced its CAPEX. Consequently, if this trend persists, GDDY's should see considerably larger profits over the long term. But more importantly, GDDY's steady FCF is why, despite being unprofitable, its cash reserves have consistently trended higher over the years. I deem this debunks the bearish thesis of GDDY being on the verge of margins collapsing, and with them, its seemingly ""lofty"" valuation.My valuation model shows that the stock is not as expensive as the bears might think. Therefore, if GDDY's current trend continues, the stock price seems fair. This is because, at this rate, GDDY will generate a whopping $1.1 billion in yearly FCF by 2024. This is outstanding after you factor in that in late 2018, the median S&P 500 stock had a 34.66 P/FCF multiple.I couldn't find a 2020 updated P/FCF figure for the S&P 500, but I sampled 100 stocks of the index and found that the median is currently 26.38. The actual P/FCF multiple could be higher because stock prices have risen considerably since late 2018. However, I'll use the 26.38 figure to be conservative. Therefore, if GDDY reaches a $1.1 billion run rate by 2024 and we value it at a 26.38 P/FCF multiple, then the implied valuation would be a whopping $29 billion 5 years from now. For context, this would translate to an incredibly 137% price appreciation potential over the next five years (until 2024).Source: Portion of the author’s S&P 500 sample.This is why I can't justify thinking GDDY is overvalued. Naturally, these valuation approaches could change significantly if the market multiples decline for any reason. Still, this would probably occur during a market crash, and under such a scenario, every stock tends to drop regardless of its particular circumstances. So I regard that bearish argument as moot.I consider GDDY has solid long-term business prospects. Its double-digit growth is consistent with healthy business fundamentals. This by itself should debunk a great deal of the bearish thesis. Besides, I believe GDDY's valuation is fair, given the current macroeconomic environment. Even GDDY’s forward PE multiple of 23.86 is in-line with the rest of the market. Consequently, after factoring in GDDY's growth, its valuation multiple becomes wholly justified. Moreover, I estimate that GDDY's strategic position and intrinsic value also make it a potential acquisition target for Amazon or Google. This is why I favor GDDY's bullish thesis over the long term.However, GDDY isn't quite a value investment yet. Thus, I think it's better to wait for GDDY to pull back. In my opinion, GDDY's ideal entry price is in the $60-$65 price range. That price range offers better value to investors but also coincides with strong technical support. Hence, I suggest you wait for GDDY to revisit that range before initiating a position.Thank you for reading, and good luck."

It forecast revenues of $2.97-$3 billion for the year. The Street was looking for revenues of $717.07 million for the quarter and $2.98 billion for the year.GoDaddy is focusing on the customer and product experience and a go-to-market strategy. In 2017, GoDaddy launched its mobile-friendly DIY website builder GoCentral. During 2018, it added to GoCentral's capabilities by integrating it across several relevant third-party platforms. It also added a number of product functions to help drive usage. The platform that GoDaddy has built now allows everyday entrepreneurs to create robust websites and syndicate marketing across the social reputation and e-commerce landscape. While GoCentral is GoDaddy's flagship DIY product, it's also making significant improvements in its WordPress offering.Nearly a third of the Internet already is built using the WordPress framework. GoDaddy's Managed WordPress offering automates the process of starting and maintaining a secure WordPress website and is helping GoDaddy drive subscriptions revenues.GoDaddy's second focus area is the go-to-market. It plans to continue to build on the brand. It's investing in brand promotion and is starting the campaign by promoting its influencers such as Ayesha Curry in its new Homemade brand. Besides icons, GoDaddy also is building a network of vertical-specific influencers who are experts in their trade.GoDaddy has been steadily integrating several technologies as part of its product innovation. Its hosting services are supported by a single automated infrastructure built on OpenStack. Its Platform-as-a-Service capability provides customers with an integrated set of services that enable them to build and deploy new products quickly and easily. It also uses open source Apache Hadoop to store and process data it collects through web crawling, local listings, social, and mobile platforms to provide business intelligence to its customers.GoDaddy has built its platform to become the world's largest cloud platform that's focused on SMBs and entrepreneurs. But it does not have a strong PaaS strategy as yet. If GoDaddy is looking for growth through acquisitions in the future, it will need to focus on developing a more comprehensive PaaS offering.GoDaddy was privately held since it was founded in 1997. Its funding details are not disclosed. In 2011, KKR, Silver Lake, and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) are estimated to have spent $2.25 billion to buy a majority stake in the company. It tried to go public in 2006 and then again in 2014. It finally went public in March 2015. It raised $460 million when it sold its shares at $20 each. The company was valued at $4.5 billion at the time of listing.Its stock is trading at $75.93 with a market capitalization of $13.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $84.97 in September last year. Like a lot of other technology stocks, GoDaddy's stock also had fallen to a low of $56.67 in December last year."

The company engages its customers from the initial steps of building an online presence by enabling them to get a domain and hosting. From there on out, GoDaddy assists its clients in the natural progression that follows by giving them support and tools to build their website and online stores, as well as helping users market them and monetize their sights.In essence, GoDaddy is a great place for new and inexperienced entrepreneurs to get started with their online brand.GoDaddy receives income from three main segments; Domains, hosting and Business applications.Source: 10-QAs we can see, in the figures for the last 3 quarters of 2019, GoDaddy receives about 45% of its revenues from Domains, followed closely by Hosting, 37% and the rest attributable to business applications. In terms of growth, the picture is reversed, with the latter growing at a rate of 20%, while growth for Domains and closing is close to 10%.As for the bottom line, GoDaddy achieved profitability as recently as 2017 with a net income of $136.4 million. Net income for the last 12 months stands at around $119 millionLooking at the share price action over the last year, we can see quite a bit of volatility. Starting the year at around $63/share, the price reached highs of around $80 in May, only to fall back to the$60 marks by May. Currently, the share price stands at ~$70. In any case, it is clear that GoDaddy disappointed investors during the second half of the year. So what are the reasons behind this?While we should expect the growth of a company such as GoDaddy to slow down over time, the latest 12 months have let missed most forecasts and disappointed investors.Source: Seeking AlphaAs we can see, revenue growth has been slow for the year compared to GoDaddy’s track record. But this isn’t the most striking piece of data from this table. Profitability has taken a very big hit, with EBITDA growth at only 3.07% and a fall in EPS of 13.35%Looking back at the company's financials, it is rather striking. Fundamentally, profitability hasn’t actually decreased. EBIT margin is increasing and the company has posted higher Operating Income every year has been increasing. However, this data is comparing the close of 2018 with 2017. The thing is, in 2017, GoDaddy reported Non operating Income of $131.7 million, highly skewing the EPS and EPS growth for the next year.To this extent, looking at the TTM figures shows that if anything GoDaddy is on track to increase profitability, with SGA, RnD and Interest expenses decreasing and overall profit margins increasing.The other more recent factor that has put a dampener on GoDaddy’s stock price, has been the current move by VeriSign Inc (VRSN) to seek to increase the prices if its domains. VeriSign is a domain registry, from which GoDaddy obtains its domain. To this effect, Verisign and Godaddy have a symbiotic relationship. Goddady registers domains for its clients on Verisign is. Goddady is a registrar, Verisign is the registry.Recently, Verisign sought government approval to increase the price of its dot com domains. This would mean an increase in the cost of GoDaddy’s operations, which would lead to one of three things:Management is confident, that given historical trends, it has the flexibility to pass on this increase in price to its customers, without demand being hit. CEO Amanpal Bhutani sees domains as the core of people’s dreams and believes that a 1 or 2 dollar increase will not affect demand in a significant way.Given the recent price decline, I find this could be an ideal time to buy the stock. There are a few reasons why I believe GoDaddy’s stock could double in the next year.GoDaddy has established itself as a dominant force in the website market, with over 18.5 million customers worldwide, the hard part in terms of marketing and brand awareness is done. GoDaddy can now focus on improving its platform and product portfolio, which it is indeed doing.Its new products, GoCentral and Managed Wordpress services, which produced growth of 40%. Furthermore, GoDaddy is also expanding its portfolio and services through partnerships and M&A. It is integrating its platform with Amazon and Facebook and has also partnered up with Kabbage (KBGE) and Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) to help its users finance their operations and seek alternative payment systems.Overall, I see GoDaddy in a privileged position to add value, as it has a direct link to its customers. Furthermore, because of the nature of PaaS, it is now in a position to organically increase its revenues by adding value through increased functionalities to its platform.The other thing I like about GoDaddy is it has recently received institutional support from some big hedge funds. 13F filings show Blue Harbor opened up a new stake with the company, while Eminence Capital increased its stake by 1.6M shares to 3.1M shares. Smart money is seeing this price as an investment opportunity and so should you.So what can we expect GoDaddy to be worth in the future? Based on a simple analysis using the industry-standard forward PEG ratio, we could expect to see GoDaddy’s shares double in the coming 24 months. Currently, GoDaddy trades at only 0.89 PEG (FWD), while the industry standard is 1.94. If our assumptions are correct and Godaddy can maintain its growth and increase profitability, we could expect this gap to close down.I believe today’s share price offers a buying opportunity. This is supported by a qualitative assessment, and also by a few institutional investors. GoDaddy has plenty of room to grow on all levels and this could be the best buying point for a long time."

Unfortunately, this brand did not create lasting profits or competitive advantage, as we discussed in our Danger Zone report in April 2018. Rather, its main business, domain registration, has grown commoditized due to the regulated nature of domain registrations and competition from giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), web.com (WEB), and many more, all of which offer domain registration for similar or cheaper prices.To diversify, GoDaddy expanded into hosting, site creation, and email account management. These markets are filled with entrenched incumbents, many of which are partnered with or owned by Alphabet. For site creation, Alphabet partners with third parties such as Shopify (SHOP), Squarespace, Wix.com (WIX), WordPress, and more. Furthermore, platforms such as Facebook (FB) and Etsy (ETSY) often make websites less important.For email, Alphabet has no partners or peers as its Gmail email platform has over 1 billion monthly active users and an estimated 27% share of the email client market. By comparison, GoDaddy is far from posing a threat with 18 million customers company wide, not just in email, at the end of June 2018.Entrenched competition and slow growth have not stopped investors from allocating to GDDY in hopes it can take even a fraction of market share. However, investors are backing the wrong horse in this race. Over the past three years, GDDY burned $1.1 billion in free cash flow while GOOGL earned over $37 billion, per Figure 1.Figure 1: GoDaddy Loses Billions While Alphabet Makes BillionsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDespite having much worse cash flow than Alphabet, GoDaddy's stock price reflects expectations for future cash flows that are much higher than the expectations in GOOGL. GoDaddy continues to generate negative economic earnings, even after operating for 20 years, yet the market expects it to grow so much that it must take a large chunk of GOOGL's (and all other competitors') domain, site creation, and email management businesses.See the comparison of the market's expectations[1] for future growth for the two stocks in Figure 2. As it stands, more than 100% of the current stock price depends on future cash flow growth, as GDDY currently has a negative economic book value per share. Only 49% of GOOGL's market cap relies on future cash flow growth.Figure 2: Future Growth Expectations for GDDY Are Dangerously HighSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsUnlike GoDaddy, Alphabet is highly profitable. Alphabet has never earned a return on invested capital (ROIC) below 25%, and it has grown economic earnings by 19% compounded annually over the past decade, as we noted in our Long Idea report in February 2018. While the market continues to wonder whether Alphabet's dominance can continue, its importance in nearly all internet services cannot be overstated. Instead of investing in competitors fighting in its shadow, investors can own the dominant Alphabet at a reasonable valuation.If GOOGL's NOPAT margin expands from 20% to 23% (based on lower tax rates) and the company can grow after-tax profit by 15% compounded annually for the next 10 years, the stock is worth $1,415/share today - a 20% upside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. Those expectations are low when compared to the company's 20% compounded annual NOPAT growth rate over the past decade.GDDY's bubble bursting would likely send a capital to competitors, and GOOGL represents the best in class.Dropbox (DBX) has built up a large base of free users with its cloud storage system, but the company has struggled to attract more profitable customers. DBX faces slowing revenue growth, accelerating expense growth, and a service that has been replicated by multiple competitors, either for free or at a similar price point. We covered each of these issues in depth in our March 2018 report.Competitors include Microsoft OneDrive, Google G-Suite, Apple iCloud, Box (BOX), Amazon Drive and more.Microsoft has solid relationships (through its Windows operating system and Office software) with the enterprise customers that Dropbox hopes to attract. Microsoft also benefits from (a) easily integrating Dropbox-like services within its deeply entrenched products and (b) generating significantly more cash than Dropbox, per Figure 3.Figure 3: DBX Barely Breaks Even While MSFT Makes BillionsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDropbox's valuation only compounds its lack of cash flow. To justify its current price of $27/share, DBX must immediately improve from a -5% to 9% NOPAT margin (average of competitors) and grow revenue by 22% compounded annually for the next 12 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario.In this scenario, Dropbox would be generating $12 billion in revenue, which, at current paying user averages, implies the firm would have nearly 103 million paying users. For reference, DBX had just 11.9 million paying users as of June 30, 2018. Microsoft's Office 365, which provides access to Microsoft's OneDrive, had 135 million commercial subscribers and 31.4 million consumer subscribers as of June, 30, 2018. Essentially, DBX must grow its user base to near Microsoft levels, while drastically improving margins and fighting off competition from Microsoft itself, along with the others listed above.Figure 4 highlights the how much more cash flow growth DBX must achieve, compared to MSFT, to justify its current stock valuation. More than 120% of DBX's current stock price (due to DBX's negative economic book value) is based on future cash flow growth. Meanwhile, only 54% of MSFT's stock price is based on future cash flow growth.Figure 4: Future Growth Expectations for DBX Are Dangerously HighSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsMSFT earned $21.8 billion in TTM economic earnings - the second highest [Apple Inc. (AAPL) is first and GOOGL is third] of any technology company we cover - on the back of strong growth in cloud services and continued Office 365 dominance.In fiscal 4Q18, Microsoft reported year-over-year revenue growth in 20 out of 22 product/service segments and double-digit growth in 16 of those segments. NOPAT margins increased from 21% in fiscal 2017 to 26% in fiscal 2018 and ROIC improved from 28% to 32% over the same time.If MSFT can maintain fiscal 2018 margins, and grow NOPAT by 11% compounded annually for the next 15 years, the stock is worth $142/share - a 25% upside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario. Those expectations are low when compared to the company's historical NOPAT growth: 12% compounded annually over the past 15 years and 33% compounded annually over the past three years.As we wrote in our original articles on the micro-bubble, changing trends, new technologies, and smaller tech ""disruptors"" get overhyped by the media and the market. The narrative that Best Buy (BBY) was doomed, that Tesla (TSLA) could supplant General Motors (GM), or that Amazon would bankrupt Walmart (WMT) never held water. The same goes for the companies on this list. Alphabet and Microsoft are highly profitable, stable companies with durable competitive advantages.

(GDDY) is the leader of online domain registration with 78.5 million domains under management, representing 22% of the world's total. The company has a history as a private company going back to 1997 with a more recent IPO in 2015. The story has been improving profitability and growing free cash flow in recent years with the company leveraging its domain leadership into a number of higher margin hosting and business services solutions. The stock has more than doubled in the past three years, although the gains have been flat over the past year. GDDY is down 17% from its all-time high.

During the quarter, the company also deployed new products in its existing Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) AWS solutions and talked up its integration with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 365 platform. It's important to remember that these are not necessarily exclusive relationships, and other web-hosting and site-building services feature similar products.GDDY Q2 financial highlights.

Management cited the timing of marketing and promotions, while intended to optimize customer lifetime value, this quarter had the effect of ""moving customer churn events from period to period"" on the weaker customer numbers.GDDY Total Customer Growth. Source: Quarterly Filings/ author chartThe other major development was the news that the CEO from the past eight years Scott Wagner was stepping down due to ""health reasons."" The company appointed Aman Bhutani, a nine-year executive from Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) as the CEO, technically effective September 4.There are many moving parts to the GoDaddy business, but at its core starts with a domain registration, when a customer registers a website name. From here GoDaddy, attempts to sell hosting services and additional website business tools that can reach the level of small enterprise functionality. It's also possible some customers utilize only individual products and services with an abundance of competing firms offering similar solutions. Clearly, business customers are more valuable as they typically require multiple domains and premium hosting plus higher value-added services compared to a hobbyist consumer managing a personal blog, for example. The concern here is that GoDaddy's growth has been decelerating particularly among domain registration which is often the first step in building long-term customer relationships.In Q2, domain segment revenue growth of 9.5% y/y was down from 15.8% in Q2 2018. The business applications segment, which has higher operating margins and has been the growth driver in recent years, was up 20.6% in Q2, but down from a rate of 28.4% in Q2 2018. Even as the average revenue per user this quarter reached a record $153, 8% higher compared to last year, the implication is that these gains appear to be plateauing or have more limited upside. The international segment revenue growth of 6.4% has also slowed considerably from 24.3% last year. Management cites a direct relationship with marketing and promotions which it is directing on areas globally that offer the highest return. The delicate balance is to maintain profitable growth with an optimal return from marketing. GoDaddy needs to win over new business customers to materially accelerate growth.While not directly addressed by management, we take a view that intense competition across all segments is the main reason for decelerating growth. A quick internet search finds a multitude of rival services among domain registrations and hosting in an otherwise price-sensitive market. Wix.com Ltd. (WIX), which began as a website building tool, has expanded to offer domain registrations and business solutions in direct competition to GoDaddy is one example. Wix with a market cap of $7.4 billion compared to GDDY at $13.2 billion reported Q2 earnings in July highlighted by user growth of 18% y/y and revenue growth of 27%, each exceeding that of GDDY. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) and privately-owned SquareSpace are two more examples of companies that are even cited in GoDaddy's annual report as competition in ""website creation and management solutions."" Based on the growth trends from WIX and SHOP, it appears GDDY is losing market share in certain parts of the business. The bearish case here is that GoDaddy continues to lose momentum and becomes more of a legacy solution.These dynamics are generally well known given the stock price is already down 17% from its all-time high set in October of 2018. On the other hand, valuation multiples have come down to generally reasonable levels represented by a forward P/E ratio of 25.6x and current price to free cash flow of 23.3x. Accelerating free cash is one of the more positive trends for the company, although the debt position at $2.4 billion (net debt of $1.2 billion) and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5x remain high but are declining. All in all, we think the stock is still expensive given the implied risks.For the full fiscal year 2019, management guidance of revenue approaching $3 billion for the year represents a 12-13% growth over 2018. Free cash flow guidance between $730 million and $745 million, up 18-20% year over year, is a positive, yet we wonder if the company can maintain that pace in the years ahead. If we are to believe the official reasons for the CEO change, investors should welcome the news nevertheless, as it could provide a fresh perspective necessary to move the company forward.Data by YChartsGoDaddy's decelerating growth along with a new generation of emerging competition from companies like WIX.com and Shopify represent the bearish case for the company. This is balanced by an otherwise solid financial outlook with positive free cash flow and debt level that is trending lower. Valuation multiples are also at more reasonable levels compared to recent years. We see more downside risks to current guidance and the stock price with a view that the market has not fully come to appreciate the intense competition which may slow growth and lead to margin pressures going forward. Investors should monitor how the company is able to maintain growth across its businesses and what, if any, new strategy initiatives its new CEO will look to implement."
4183534,104576,2018-06-25T10:30:07-04:00,"GoDaddy has provided broadly the same service over the last decade, and has not adapted its business model to evolving technology.
        Its rivals are more innovative and in many cases sell their own in-house gTLDs.
        When the stock's weak fundamentals are combined with the lack of innovation at the company, the outlook is not positive.","Innovative, gTLD-oriented rivals are quickly outcompeting GoDaddy in the race for dominance in this increasingly important area. In the long-run its lack of enthusiasm for the future direction of domain names will significantly bring down the firm's highly inflated stock price.In my opinion, one of the best ways to measure GoDaddy's recent success is by analysing its responsiveness to one of the major emerging trends in the domain name industry, new gTLDs (generic top-level domains).These alternatives to the original top-level domains such as "".com"" are arguably the future of domain names, offering registrants an extension more specific to their site's focus, and reducing overcrowding in the registrations of the existing gTLDs.In the past five years, new commercial domain extensions have been slowly introduced under ICANN's guidance. Some of the most popular of these are shown in the table below:(Source: ntldstats.com)With 23 million domain names registered under these new gTLDs since 2013, the new extensions are clearly playing an increasingly important role in the success of a domain name business. GoDaddy's reluctance to get strongly enough involved in them since they were first announced has continued, and poses a serious problem.(Source: ntldstats.com)GoDaddy certainly did have its own opportunity to apply to become the registry for some of its own private extensions (.home and .casa) but it withdrew from the process, leaving it open to competition from others, and adding to the evidence from my point of view that GoDaddy is the opposite of an innovative company, seeming mainly to want to preserve its core outdated business.Other companies which were more actively involved in the application process are now able to own proprietary gTLDs. Uniregistry, for example, owns and directly sells their Uniregistrar domains through their main website. TLDs owned by Uniregistrar include .link, .click, .lol, .sexy, .cars and .mom. Because these competitors have the advantage of being able to buy domains from their in-house registries, this removes any fees and maximizes profits on the registrar side of their businesses. GoDaddy's failure to market the gTLDs it does sell is also clear from the table below showing domain name sales for each main registrar:(Source: ntldstats.com)Alibaba, at the top of the list, has been much more engaged with new extensions. The company, for example, owns and manages the gTLD "".xin"". It has marketed that particular TLD as a trust-centric extension aimed at ""large companies, SMEs, and individuals that are willing to demonstrate themselves as a trusted and reliable entity"" in China.Admittedly, NameCheap does not directly own any gTLDs. However, its innovation in other areas and competitiveness in terms of pricing means it will ultimately outperform GoDaddy.It's clear that GoDaddy hasn't embraced gTLDs with the enthusiasm they deserve - but there are also other problems with GoDaddy's competitiveness.Firstly, the company is not competitive in terms of pricing. This is an especially large problem when you consider that domain names have almost no marginal cost. Domains from GoDaddy typically cost around $14.99/year, compared with domains from Namecheap which cost just $10.69/year.In addition, GoDaddy charges extra for services such as private registration, which are often free from other providers. These WHOIS privacy options offer semi-anonymity to those who register domain names. Without private registration, domain name owners' private information is posted into a publicly searchable WHOIS database. The fact that GoDaddy charges for such services only adds to the unwarranted fees GoDaddy charges on every transaction.When GoDaddy's lack of competitiveness is viewed alongside some of the numbers relating the stock, it becomes even more clear how overvalued the company really is.The stock has a P/E ratio of 71.3x. While some could argue this might be a a reasonable P/E for a rapidly growing internet company like Amazon or Netflix, GoDaddy has very little room left to grow, as the demand for domain names as a whole is pretty constant over time and there are no new markets to expand into. In this context then, such a high P/E ratio can only be an indicator of a poor investment.Combining that P/E ratio with the (unrealistic) analysts' consensus earnings growth projection of 32.1%, the company has a PEG ratio of 2.2x. Under the traditional logic that a company with a PEG of 1x is fairly priced, GoDaddy is also very overpriced by this metric. It's important to add that Godaddy's recent growth is largely inorganic (appearing principally to come from its acquisition of Main Street Hub).Based on P/B ratio, GoDaddy is seemingly even more horribly overpriced. The firm has a P/B value of 20.0x compared to the average P/B for internet companies of around 3.5x. This provides almost no margin of safety for investors. It's partially as a result of GoDaddy's massive debt in comparison with its net worth (debt is approximately 4.5x net worth).In addition, GoDaddy's value based on Discounted Cash Flow is $46.70. With a current stock price of $73.37, it is clear that the stock is also overvalued by this measure.In spite of this, the price has irrationally continued to rise and for the reasons I have outlined is inevitably due for a correction.gTLDs are a long-term trend in the domain name industry. Registrations (currently at 23 million) will only continue to increase over time, and GoDaddy is competitively in a terrible position to profit from this growth.I would not advise buying or holding GoDaddy. If you have any of the stock in your portfolio, now would be a good time to sell while the market as a whole is asleep to the irrational price of the stock and the lack of suitability of the firm for the future of the domain name market."
4040195,60151,2017-01-27T13:26:09-05:00,"GDDY has appreciated substantially since its IPO in 2015.However, with the influx of competition threatening each of GDDY's business segments, revenue growth and margin expansion will be difficult to achieve.This lofty valuation coupled with significant headwinds on the horizon leads me to conclude that GDDY is a risky investment.","GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) made a splash in 2005 by buying commercial time during the Super Bowl. GoDaddy initially had plans for an IPO in 2006, but the company withdrew its IPO plans in late 2006, amid concerns over market turbulence. In 2011, private equity firms KKR and Silver Lake led a $2.33 billion buyout of GoDaddy. Then GoDaddy was finally able to IPO and its shares were first sold on April 1, 2015, and the stock has been steadily increasing since. However, at the current valuation, I believe that GDDY is not a prudent investment.I will briefly discuss GDDY's recent preliminary Q4 and full year results and then delve into the business operations, and outline my bear thesis.Preliminary Q4 and Full Year 2016 ResultsThis morning GoDaddy announced preliminary Q4 and full year 2016 results. Specifically, management expects Q4 revenue to be roughly $486 million and full year 2016 revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion. The company also announced that net cash provided by operating activities for the full year 2016 is expected to be about $387 million, with total cash and short-term investments ending 2016 at $573 million. Management also stated that total long-term debt outstanding was approximately $1.04 billion. The full Q4 and full year 2016 report will be released after the bell on February 15.Lofty ValuationGDDY has historically produced losses, but was able to turn a small profit of $4.8 million last quarter. However, with the influx of competition in each of its business segments, I am skeptical that it will be able to remain profitable in the coming quarters. Despite generating such little net income and having full year 2016 revenue of about $1.85 billion, GDDY trades at a lofty valuation with a market capitalization of nearly $6 billion.Summary of BusinessGDDY competes in three major market segments: domains, hosting, and applications. Revenue for each of these segments in Q3 was: $236 million, $174 million, and $61 million respectively. On a percentage of total revenue domains represented 51%, hosting was 37%, and business applications was 13%.Here's a quick primer on each of these segments from GDDY's 10-Q:In the most recent quarter, revenue from domains increased 10% on y/y basis, primarily attributable to a 3.9% increase in domains under management, ending Q3 with 63.3 million. Revenue from hosting grew 15% and the business applications segment expanded 36%. All together, revenue grew 14.84% in the quarter on a y/y basis. As shown by the chart below, revenue growth has been in a downward trajectory for the past couple of years.Expense growth has outpaced revenue growth, with the cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) growing 18% in the same period. One of the primary drivers of the increase was due to higher costs associated with more domains under management. Additionally, GDDY increased its spending on software licensing fees to provide more offerings to its customers and prevent them from flocking to one of the many competitors in the market. I will further discuss the competitive landscape below.Customer care costs are variable and with each added user, this cost will rise. This cost structure means that even if GDDY is very successful in getting customers, the business is not too scalable. Customer care costs are currently $16 per customer and will continue to rise as GoDaddy must staff its customer care facilities with more representatives. With GDDY also trying to grow in international markets, this cost could increase quickly, due to the requirement of having representatives who speak different languages.GoDaddy's Market and CompetitionGoDaddy's strong brand value has allowed for it to be a huge player for registering domains and for web hosting. However, these markets have become quite commoditized, with an influx of competition from start-ups to established internet companies. This commoditization of the market will hurt GDDY's pricing power and profitability.Domain MarketIn the domain market, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has entered the fray and, although the program is still in BETA, GDDY should be concerned because Google has the footprint to take a huge market share and further commoditize this industry. GoDaddy sells a "".com"" domain for $0.99 for the first year, and then $14.99 for each subsequent year. However, Google has undercut them, offering domains for $12.Source: Google DomainsHosting & ApplicationsMoreover, hosting and applications are highly competitive markets, with software and service providers fighting aggressively to gain market share. WordPress (owned by Automattic) has been a big player in this market. Also, recently-public Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) has a simple and cheap platform to use. Rackspace, which was recently taken private by Apollo Global Management, is also a competitor and targets a more tech-savvy userbase.Additionally, Google entering the domain market also hurts GDDY's hosting business since it has partnerships for hosting with several sites such as Blogger, Shopify, Squarespace, Weebly, and Wix. Therefore, Google will likely take market share in domain registering and drive GDDY's market share away to competitors in the hosting and applications industries.Source: Google DomainsGoDaddy GoCentralOn January 25th, GDDY announced a new platform dedicated to small, independent ventures, called GoCentral. This new service combines a mobile website builder with an integrated set of marketing and e-commerce tools. The idea is to create a simple platform where smaller players can create a professional website in under an hour, even on a mobile phone. GoDaddy is trying to rely on what has worked in the past and ""will give GoCentral the center stage in this year's . . . Super Bowl Commercial.""However, with a substantial number of players already providing comparable offerings, GoCentral is unlikely to contribute much to the bottom line. Moreover, it is a red flag that GDDY is spending so much to market this project which will compete in a very competitive market.Other Notable NegativesDebtAs of the last quarter, GDDY's long-term debt consisted of a $1.1 billion term loan, due May 13, 2021, with an effective interest rate of 4.9%. GDDY also has access to a revolving credit loan due in May 13, 2019. The company has not borrowed under this facility yet and has $150 million available.Although this debt level is not alarming yet, it is noteworthy to mention that GDDY also had current liabilities on its balance sheet of $1.26 billion, which is much higher than its current assets of $940 billion. Moreover, although its total asset to total debt level is not too worrisome, a large segment of its assets are not liquid, with goodwill and intangible assets consisting of $2.38 billion of its $3.7 billion in total assets.If GDDY faces further pressure from competition, and becomes unprofitable, it may face liquidity problems. Although not imminent, this risk is worth mentioning. Moreover, GDDY's term loan is secured by GDDY's assets which could make it more difficult for GDDY to get further borrowing.International Expansion ProblemsA stronger dollar will slow GoDaddy's international business. Moreover, if Trump implements protectionist policies, that will also hamper GDDY's international growth. Finally, GoDaddy faces added competition from local players in the various markets it is trying to enter. For example, HiChina, an Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) company currently dominates the China domain market.Institutional HoldingsThe substantial number of shares that institutional investors still hold, following the buyout in 2011, is another key risk to consider. With 86.4 million shares outstanding, the majority of shares are held by institutional investors. If these institutions begin to sell of their shares to the market, the influx of shares could significantly depress GDDY's share price.Source: Nasdaq.comConcluding RemarksGoDaddy operates in a fiercely competitive market and its business model is not conducive to profitable growth. The simple fact is GDDY does not have a competitive moat and its average cost per customer acquisition will increase and its pricing will come under pressure. With revenue growth declining and margins at a significant risk of declining, I suggest staying away from this stock."
4165133,24157,2018-04-24T09:25:18-04:00,"We first rang alarm bells on this company when it went public in April 2015.Since then, profits have declined and the market has grown more competitive, yet the stock has tripled.Now, the firm’s lack of resources (relative to competitors) and low profitability make the expectations baked into the stock price look overly optimistic.","We first rang alarm bells on this company when it went public in April 2015. Since then, profits have declined and the market has grown more competitive, yet the stock has tripled.Now, the firm’s lack of resources (relative to competitors) and low profitability make the expectations baked into the stock price look overly optimistic. These issues, and more, make GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY) this week’s Danger Zone pick.We leverage our Robo-Analyst technology[1] to analyze the footnotes and MD&A in company filings to get an accurate look at a company’s true profitability. Through this work, we find that GoDaddy’s GAAP net income was artificially increased in 2017 due to hidden (and non-hidden) non-operating income.We made 10 adjustments to GoDaddy’s 2017 income statement, with a total value of $279 million. One of the larger adjustments was the removal of $32 million (23% of GAAP net income) in non-operating income related to the gain on sale of PlusServer. We also removed $123 million (90% of GAAP net income) in tax receivable agreement liability adjustments included in the income statement.After taking into account all adjustments, we removed $86 million in non-operating income from GAAP net income. These adjustments revealed that despite GAAP net income increasing from -$17 million in 2016 to $136 million in 2017, after-tax profit (NOPAT) fell from $54 million to $50 million over the same time.This disconnect in GAAP net income and the true recurring profits of the business is not new either. Since 2015, GDDY’s net income has grown from -$47 million to $136 million while NOPAT has fallen 10% compounded annually, per Figure 1.Figure 1: GDDY’s Misleading GAAP Net IncomeSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThe decline in NOPAT stems from NOPAT margins falling from 4% in 2015 to 2% in 2017. At the same time, average invested capital turns, a measure of balance sheet efficiency, have fallen slightly from 0.70 in 2015 to 0.68 in 2017. Falling margins and inefficient capital use have dropped GDDY’s return on invested capital (ROIC) down from 3% in 2015 to 2% in 2017.We’ve long warned investors about companies using non-GAAP metrics to obscure actual profits. GoDaddy’s use of non-GAAP takes this misleading practice one step further and limits comparability to previous years by changing the non-GAAP metric on which they tell investors to focus. At the end of 2016, GoDaddy stopped reporting adjusted EBITDA, which removed significant expenses, such as equity-based compensation, from its calculation. In its place, the firm began reporting “unlevered free cash flow”, which is supposed to “evaluate the business prior to the impact of its capital structure and after-tax distributions”. Unlevered free cash flow adds back cash paid for interest and cash paid for acquisition-related costs.Both metrics significantly overstate the profitability of the business. Adjusted EBITDA removes real operating expenses and completely ignores the balance sheet, while “unlevered free cash flow” doesn’t take into account the costs of acquisitions, like GoDaddy’s $1.8 billion acquisition of HEG in 2017. Switching between the metrics exaggerates their flaws by making it difficult to compare profitability between periods.In either case, Figure 2 shows that non-GAAP metrics provide a misleading picture of GDDY’s profitability. From 2015-2016, adjusted EBITDA increased from $147 million to $263 million. When calculating adjusted EBITDA, GoDaddy removed $40 million (>100% of net income) and $57 million (>100% of net income) in equity-based compensation expense in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$65 million to -$68 million.Figure 2: GDDY’s Non-GAAP Metrics Paint False Picture of Firm* Prior to 2016, GDDY reported Adjusted EBITDA, which was replaced by Unlevered Free Cash Flow in 2016Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFrom 2016-2017, unlevered free cash flow rose from $357 million to $496 million, while free cash flow (see calculation here) fell from $161 million to -$1.5 billion and economic earnings fell from -$68 million to -$152 million.GoDaddy’s executive compensation misaligns executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. The misalignment helps drive the profit decline shown in Figures 1 and 2.GoDaddy’s executives earn annual cash bonuses based on the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals. The corporate performance goals include bookings, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, and total customers. Equity awards are given in either time-based options or performance-based stock units, which are also tied to bookings and adjusted EBITDA.As noted above, these non-GAAP metrics do little to measure the true profitability of the firm. Instead, they include numerous adjustments that allow executives to earn bonus awards while destroying shareholder value. We’ve demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not non-GAAP net income or similar metrics, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without major changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction.GoDaddy may be best known for its flashy Super Bowl ads from years ago, but the company operates in three main segments: domains, hosting & presence, and business applications. See Figure 3.Figure 3: Domains Still Make Up Largest Portion of RevenueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsGoDaddy may have had an advantage at one point due to its superior brand recognition, but its advantage has disappeared. Customers today are just as familiar, if not more so, with many of its competitors.Per Figure 4, GoDaddy’s margins and ROIC rank well below its largest competition (as noted in its 10-K) and only outrank previous Danger Zone Pick Dropbox (DBX). More alarming, GoDaddy’s margins have declined despite diversifying its business away from the commoditized domain registration business.Figure 4: GoDaddy’s NOPAT Margin Ranks Near the BottomSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings The domains segment allows customers to register and purchase domain names. This segment is largely commoditized, as the price registrars pay for domains is set by VeriSign (VRSN), which holds a contract to distribute domain names from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This contract runs through 2024 and sets a standard price on the cost of domains. With set costs, this segment provides little room for margin expansion despite being GoDaddy’s largest revenue source.Domain registration competitors include Web.com (WEB), namecheap.com, DreamHost, United Internet, Donuts, Google (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) - which recently entered the domain registration market - and more.Even worse, what was once GoDaddy’s namesake business is losing ground. From 2014-2016, GoDaddy’s market share in domain registration fell from 21% to 19%. It jumped back to 22% in 2017, but largely due to GoDaddy’s acquisition of Host Europe Group, which added 1.6 million customers. With dwindling capital (more on this below), GoDaddy cannot rely on acquisitions to boost market share.The hosting & presence segment offers website hosting services as well as tools to build websites and online stores. GoDaddy provides these services in an effort to diversify its revenue sources while also providing additional value to its customers.Website hosting and creation competitors include Amazon Web Services (AMZN), WordPress, Shopify (SHOP), Squarespace, Weebly, Wix (WIX), and more. Unfortunately for GoDaddy, its site creation lags many of its competitors, in both market share and function. According to Datanyze, which calculates market share for web technologies, Wix is the leader in website building with a 23% market share. Squarespace comes in second with 17%, while Weebly has 15% and GoDaddy has just 9% of the market.Additionally, numerous reviews note that GoDaddy’s site builder, which does not offer a free version, lacks standard features often provided by free competitors. Product integration (domain and site building) can be a positive add-on, but only if you’re offering clients the best available services and tools.Lastly, the business applications segment includes email accounts, email marketing tools, and IP-based telephone services.Business application competitors include tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (via Gmail), and Dropbox. Social platforms and third-party e-commerce sites such as Facebook (FB) or Etsy (ETSY) also present competition as they provide sales and marketing capabilities outside of creating a traditional website.We don’t think it is likely that this business segment will generate much, if any, profit growth given the stiff competition and relatively weak offerings of GoDaddy.Despite being founded in 1997, GoDaddy’s first reported accounting profits occurred in 2017. As we noted earlier, this reported profit was artificially achieved with significant unusual income. Because of the lack of real profits, investors have chosen to focus on revenue growth and customer growth, while ignoring real issues in the business. As the industry slows, rising costs and lack of resources in a highly competitive (and commoditized) industry threaten any bull case.According to VeriSign’s Domain Name Industry Brief reports, the growth in domain name registrations is slowing significantly. Per Figure 5, top level domain name registrations grew 1% year over year in 2017, down from 10% year over year in 2011.Figure 5: Domain Name Registration Growth is SlowingSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDespite the slowing growth of domain registrations, GoDaddy achieved record revenues in 2017 and grew its customer base by 18% (11% came from an acquisition). However, its operating expenses grew even faster. Year over year, general & administrative, technology & development, and customer care costs grew 28%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Cost of revenues and marketing and advertising grew 18% and 11% YoY as well. For reference, revenue grew 21% YoY.Making matters worse, some of these costs may not be reduced, unless GDDY sacrifices key functions. For instance, customer care expenses represent the cost to advise and service customers. As GoDaddy strives to increase customer count, it must also increase customer care. For a firm already plagued with numerous complaints regarding its customer care, this cost structure could prove a challenge to sustaining customer growth and achieving profitability.Beyond cost concerns, GoDaddy lacks the capital and the operational flexibility to grow at rates required by its valuation. GoDaddy’s excess cash is dwarfed by its more profitable competitors.Figure 6: GoDaddy’s Spending and Capital Resources Lag CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings In their last fiscal years, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook spent over $37 billion in research & development expenses combined, or nearly five times GDDY’s market cap. Dropbox, Shopify, and Etsy each allocated more capital to research & development as a percent of revenue than GoDaddy as well, per Figure 6. GDDY is fighting stronger competition that is investing more into their businesses.Further limiting bull arguments, GDDY needs to keep investing heavily to maintain its revenue and customer growth. The majority of its customer growth in 2017 was attributable to acquisitions, and its organic customer growth was just 7%. However, without the resources of its larger competitors, GoDaddy cannot adequately develop new technologies to meet consumer needs and risks losing business to other offerings.Even if you believe that GDDY can reverse years of poor operating results (in a more competitive market than when it started) and maintain high revenue growth, such optimism is already reflected in the stock price. GDDY’s current valuation implies that it will immediately improve margins and significantly grow profits for years to come, as shown below.Despite the fundamental deterioration noted above, GDDY is up 67% while the S&P is up just 12% over the past year. This rapid price appreciation has left GDDY significantly overvalued, both by traditional metrics and when analyzing the expectations baked into the stock price. GDDY’s P/E ratio of 77.6 is well above the Technology sector average of 37.8 and the S&P 500 average of 24. When we analyze the cash flow expectations baked into the stock price, we also find that GDDY faces significant downside risk.To justify its current price of $61/share, GDDY must immediately improve NOPAT margins to 6% (slightly below competitor Web.com and well above GDDY’s 2% in 2017) and grow NOPAT by 25% compounded annually for the next 13 years. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here.In this scenario, GDDY would be generating over $15.4 billion in revenue, which, at current per user averages, implies the firm would have over 110 million customers. For reference, GDDY had 17 million customers in 2017. To grow its user base to such levels, GoDaddy must convince the next generation of consumers that its services are better than the competition, not just milk the customer base acquired when it had first-mover advantage. New customers may be harder to acquire given how much more sophisticated and discerning they are about the internet and website. It will take more than some flashy Super Bowl commercials to get their business.Even in a highly optimistic scenario, GDDY holds significant downside. If we assume GDDY achieves an 8% NOPAT margin (equal to competitor Web.com) and grows NOPAT by 23% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $25/share today – a 59% downside. See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here.Each of these scenarios also assumes GDDY is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, GDDY’s invested capital has grown on average $424 million (19% of 2017 revenue) over the past three years.Often the largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk”, which means an acquirer comes in and pays for GDDY at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. An acquisition could come from another firm in the domain registration industry or web hosting platform looking to increase its presence in the market. However, as domain registration grows more commoditized an acquisition may be less likely now than in the past. Any firm looking to acquire GDDY would be imprudently allocating capital and destroying substantial shareholder value in an acquisition.We show below how expensive GDDY remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies.To begin, GoDaddy has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, GDDY is worth less than its current share price.Figures 7 and 8 show what we think Alphabet should pay for GDDY to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. While purely hypothetical, acquiring GDDY would immediately enhance Google’s domain registration business while providing a “one-stop shop” from registration to site building to email and applications via Google Drive. However, there are limits on how much GOOGL would pay for GDDY to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ‘goal ROIC’ assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 17% in year one and 12% in year two, which is the consensus estimate for GDDY’s revenue growth. For the subsequent years, we use 12% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of consensus estimates. We use 18% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with GOOGL would create additional revenue opportunities through increased search marketing and cross-selling of existing GOOGL services.We conservatively assume that GOOGL can grow GDDY’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume GDDY immediately achieves a 12% NOPAT margin, which is the average of GOOGL and GDDY’s margins. For reference, GDDY’s 2017 NOPAT margin is just 2%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices for GOOGL to Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 7 shows the ‘goal ROIC’ for GOOGL as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 7%. Even if GDDY can grow revenue by 16% compounded annually, with a 12% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $61/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would only be value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal GOOGL’s WACC.Figure 8: Implied Acquisition Prices for GOOGL to Achieve 31% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 8 shows the next ‘goal ROIC’ of 31%, which is GOOGL’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to GOOGL shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the implied stock value fails to reach $0/share, mainly because of GDDY’s large liabilities noted earlier and its debt load. Even assuming this best-case scenario, GOOGL would destroy over $10 billion by purchasing GDDY at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 16% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for GOOGL.As more domain registries enter the industry, the race to the bottom for profit margins becomes inevitable. There are few differentiating features when registering domains, and pricing is mostly regulated. Additionally, the number of free and premium website creation tools challenges growth in that business segment. As noted earlier, with margins near the bottom of the industry, GoDaddy can ill afford any further pricing pressure while its limited cash levels leave it with limited ability to continue enhancing its platform.Beyond industry trends, GoDaddy’s earnings could prove a negative catalyst as well. Over the past year, 2018 consensus expectations have fallen dramatically, from $0.83/share in April 2017, to $0.42/share in April 2018. Healthy companies can consistently generate and grow profits. GoDaddy’s business has done the opposite, and any future earnings miss could send shares lower.While we don’t attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, such a realization could severely damage investors’ portfolios.Over the past three months, 18.3 million insider shares have been purchased and 27.8 million have been sold for a net effect of 9.5 million insider shares sold. These sales represent 7% of shares outstanding and fail to create confidence in the long-term prospects of the business.Short interest is currently 4.5 million shares, which equates to 3% of shares outstanding and three days to cover. Short interest rose 7% over the prior month and remains near its 52-week high. Short interest could rise if earnings fail to beat expectations or a dilutive capital raise is announced.As investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings. Below are specifics on the adjustments we make based on Robo-Analyst findings in GoDaddy’s 2017 10-K:Income Statement: We made $279 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $86 million in non-operating income (4% of revenue). We removed $196 million in non-operating income and $110 million in non-operating expenses. You can see all the adjustments made to GDDY’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $1.3 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $623 million. One of the largest adjustments was $432 million related to midyear acquisitions. This adjustment represented 11% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to GDDY’s balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $3.2 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $2.2 billion. Apart from $2.6 billion in total debt, which includes $115 million in operating leases, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was $146 million in deferred tax liabilities. This adjustment represents 2% of GDDY’s market cap.The following funds receive our Unattractive-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to GoDaddy Inc.This article originally published on April 16, 2018.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1] Harvard Business School features the powerful impact of our research automation technology in the case New Constructs: Disrupting Fundamental Analysis with Robo-Analysts."

The company has become the market leader through significant advertising and marketing spend, including regular Super Bowl spots. However, GoDaddy competes in a crowded industry, selling commoditized products with increasing competition, both from innovative start-ups and Internet giants. Meanwhile, costs are rising as the company attempts to fend off competition and build its brand in competitive international markets. The stock is overvalued by 35%.1. Whereas top-line growth is slowing in the US due to increasing competition, international expansion will be difficult as GDDY will go up against established local firms in international markets.Commoditized nature of the domain business ensures no pricing power. More than half of company's revenues originate from the sales of domain names, a lower-margin commoditized business. There are hundreds of companies accredited to sell the same domain names at very competitive pricing. GoDaddy sells a "".com"" domain for $0.99 for the first year and $14.99 for future years, $7.85 of which it has to pay to VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN), the domain registrar. Other popular websites charge the same or less for domain registrations. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) entered the space in 2015, selling domains for a flat rate of $12. Although Google has not actively promoted domains, the product rounds out its website offering.Increased domestic competition in website building and hosting will pressure top-line growth. Competition for website building and hosting is intensifying with the increasing popularity of easy-to-use, sleek-design website builders. The most popular sites are Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), Squarespace and Weebly. Wix, the only public company of the three, has 1.77 million premium users, a growth of 45% in the prior year.GoDaddy sources 40% of its new customers from paid media, a large portion of which find the site through Google. According to Google Trends, the relative number of Google searches for GoDaddy has been declining while those for the newer competitors have been rising. Wix is now searched for almost as often as the much larger GoDaddy and 1&1.International expansion will be difficult. GDDY is attempting to grow share in international markets by localizing its offering. However, GoDaddy will experience fierce competition in each of the international markets as local firms have already been selling domains and website hosting for many years. For instance, GoDaddy recently announced that it will attempt to expand into China. However, the Chinese domain market is led by HiChina, an Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) company. Furthermore, GDDY will not offer hosting services in China as many of its servers are blacklisted in the country.2. Costs are rising as GDDY battles domestic competitors and seeks international growth with a business model reliant on variable costs.Customer acquisition costs are rising. Last year, customer acquisition costs increased by 28% to $73 per new customer as GDDY is fending off domestic competition and attempting to raise brand awareness in international markets. Yet, revenues are not growing fast enough as indicated by a decreasing customer lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio. Although GoDaddy has an 81% brand awareness in the US, the company is not well known in new international markets. In developing markets such as India, GoDaddy also faces the challenge of persuading small businesses that they need a website. According to the Vice President and Managing Director at GoDaddy India, ""most people in India are saddled from the 'Not-for-me' syndrome, and that the Internet is only meant for big brands or firms and they are not big enough to need a website."" Customer care costs are variable and will increase with international growth. GoDaddy's business model relies on providing robust customer care 24/7. However, customer care costs rise proportionally to new customer growth, reducing GDDY's ability to increase profitability. Customer care costs ($16 per customer) have been increasing at a similar rate as the average revenue per customer. These costs will continue to grow as GDDY staffs new customer care facilities abroad with local language speakers.Consensus View/MisperceptionsGDDY will capture a large share of the ~200 million in global small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). Increasing domestic competition will reduce GDDY's domestic market share. Whereas the international market is large, GDDY will have to take share away from local competitors that have been operating in the market for many years. In addition, the need to establish an online presence will grow gradually abroad as many small businesses currently don't see the need for their own websites, especially with the growth of other alternatives, including Facebook, Google Local and Yelp.GDDY will leverage its platform to expand internationally with little additional costs. GDDY's business model includes significant variable costs. Both customer care and customer acquisition costs will increase with revenues, preventing the company from significantly increasing profitability.CatalystsRevenue growth will continue to decrease as domestic competition increases while the company still has to make significant inroads in international markets. Customer acquisition costs will increase faster than the ARPU as the company spends more to fend off domestic completion and raise brand awareness abroad.Price TargetI have a price target of $20, representing an upside of 35%. The target is based on the average of multiples of EBITDA ratio and DCF valuation less than the NPV of the TRA payments. I use the DCF approach as there does not seem to be a market consensus as to what valuation metric the stock trades on, with different analysts using sales, EBITDA or uFCF multiples. Key assumptions include declining customer and ARPU growth and increasing customer acquisition and customer care costs.RisksInternational growth. GDDY may be able to take significant share in new international markets if it can demonstrate a superior product. For instance, in four years, GDDY has taken 33% of the Indian market for domain names.Secular trends. Increasing SMB online penetration will continue to provide a significant tailwind for GoDaddy. Top-line growth can lead to higher profitability if the company changes its business model to reduce costs.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

4060938,45911,2017-04-15T10:00:00-04:00,Detailed analysis of GoDaddy's operating margins by segment.How I predicted last quarter's surprise EPS miss from the changing state of the web.Management's track record and the state of the balance sheet.,"ContentsRecent History: A (not!) Surprising Miss & Upgrade   It's been said that a rising tide lifts all boats, and GoDaddy (GDDY) riding the growth of the internet over the past two decades certainly fits that aphorism. Yet, on January 23 of this year, my service predicted that GoDaddy would miss 4Q16 EPS expectations. Just four days later, in conjunction with a major new acquisition, GoDaddy pre-announced revenue in line with analyst expectations. Yet, when the official report came out on Feb. 15, it looked like this:GDDY was initially down almost 10%, and multiple analysts on the conference call expressed concern about the near-term revenue guidance. However, in the absence of any explanation, the market quickly dismissed the results as a blip, as you can see from the chart below.  Just last week, the latest upgrade from Barclays, a long-time bull that just happens to be the primary lending, Administrative & Collateral Agent, and Letter of Credit Issuer for GoDaddy, pushed the stock to an all-time high of $38. This article will examine GoDaddy's accounting and management practices to show why that is misguided. More importantly, it will look at how the internet is changing to explain how I predicted last quarter's surprise loss, and why it is just the first step in a new and damaging trend.  Current Business Overview: The Main Business is Essentially a Loss-leader  GoDaddy reports three business segments: In terms of margins, the original domain registration business should always be a race to the bottom because registrars are essentially just intermediaries for the TLD monopolies, mainly VeriSign (VRSN), which processes over 80% of new domains, with .com still the runaway leader. Despite criticism, this will not change within a meaningful time frame, as VeriSign has just renewed its agreement with ICANN until 2024. My calculations from the most recent 8-K indicate that the segment barely got above breakeven:All revenue figures in millions $  These calculations are very kind. GoDaddy did not update its ""over 63m domain names"" marketing figure in the most recent quarter, so either it is not growing, or the Domains segment actually loses money. Nonetheless, the Domains segment is very important because it is the gateway for business to flow to the other segments. The split of costs and thus operating margin, between Hosting & Presence and Business Information is a judgment call, but it's certain that these two segments account for nearly all of GoDaddy's margin.  GoDaddy has attempted to mitigate the domain margin issue with aggressive marketing, and by embracing questionable tactics such as cybersquatting, which leads to dysfunctional stats like the internet having about 1 billion registered domains with only 171m active sites. Though advertising has been somewhat successful in terms of market growth, it has not been profitable. In fact, the company has never shown an annual profit, and filings from the failed IPO attempts document consistent net losses over more than a decade, with the only gap in records being 2007 and 2008. Avoiding football advertising expense did help the company turn its first-ever quarterly profit of 5 cents in 3Q16. Management also does what it can to obfuscate the situation, focusing on top-line stats like ARPU (average revenue per user) rather than margins or profitability, and even those are squirrelly, as the amended 10-K had to replace ""revenue"" with ""bookings,"" while confirming that the Domains segment is lower margin than the other two.   The Encrevolution Catalyst  Short Term: Another Earnings Miss   The primary reason that I think profitability will remain elusive is that the web is changing in a way that will harm and potentially cripple GoDaddy's Hosting & Presence segment, which includes domain validations. There has been a movement for the last two years to encrypt all web communications. That movement saw a major breakout in 3Q16 as a non-profit called Let's Encrypt, which was founded by two former Mozilla.org employees, came out of beta. In a nutshell, Let's Encrypt makes getting and maintaining the domain validation certificates used by any secure website simple, automated, and free. It supported 11.5m domains by year end, up from about 4.3m from ALL prior quarters.  GoDaddy is the closest thing to a pure play on this development because about 95% of the certificates it issues are simple domain validations of the sort that Let's Encrypt supplies, rather than the organizational level ones supplied to big firms by companies like Symantec (SYMC). GoDaddy's response to a recent in-house security vulnerability in this very area allows us to measure the impact. About 6100 customers and less than 2% of certificates issued over the course of 5+ months were affected, according to GoDaddy press release captioned ""We've got it covered."" In dialogue where Mozilla security questioned that assertion, GoDaddy revealed that 8850 invalid certs were issued, allowing us to infer the following statistics:These calculations do not account for seasonality. Stat #2 is important because GoDaddy certificate annual renewal pricing is highly discounted for multiple certs ($70 for the first, minus $10 for each additional up to 5, for a minimum of $30 each.) The average coincides with GoDaddy's promo pricing of $56. Using that price, if all 8850 certificate owners ceased to pay GoDaddy for certificates, the loss for the period would only come to $495.6K, or about a half cent in EPS, but GoDaddy's error wasn't even found until after the new year. So, that's not important for this quarter, but I think it does give a best case scenario for the company. The worst case is that mishaps like this cause GoDaddy lose CA (certificate authority) trust and thus all validation business, with major spillover to its hosting services. This may sound far-fetched, but loss of trust has already happened to other CAs for similar problems. Symantec is now trying to face down similar problems for incompetence of its own.  My base case uses a top down approach instead: back in August, about 8% of the certificates issued by Let's Encrypt were to domains that already used encryption. That percentage could have easily gone up in the third quarter, but applying it to GoDaddy's 10.3% CA  market share works out to 132K lost certs or $3.3m of the company's highest margin revenue in 4Q16 alone. Other estimates put GoDaddy's market share at nearly twice that level, so these calculations should be considered conservative. The 3Q16 conference call confirms that GoDaddy does all its SSL technology development in-house so, if anything, associated costs will stay the same or go up as the company attempts to address its issues. That put my base case estimate of the hit to the bottom line at 3.4 cents per share from certificates alone. Again, the fallout from GoDaddy's certificate mishandling came after last quarter, but I think you can see it in the chart above and that the more general trend is ongoing.  Medium Term: Added Expense, Profit Attrition and Excuses  Let's Encrypt has sponsorship from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), amongst others. Major hosting platform OVH just renewed as a platinum sponsor and has plans to expand the available services. We're still near the beginning, but critical mass has been reached. Let's Encrypt spent the last two years doing the bureaucratic drudge work to become a CA. That work is ongoing, but already universally functional and currently accepted by the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Mozilla, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) root programs. Others (Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and BlackBerry (BBRY)) should follow soon, putting Let's Encrypt on a clear path to eventually fulfill the same role for domain validation that ICANN currently does for registrations. Important technology community websites like Slashdot, Debian, and the Linux Foundation are already using Let's Encrypt directly.   Where Let's Encrypt has partners, GoDaddy has competitors. It is broadly reviled in the developer community, as shown by the responses to its recent calamity. The company is bounded by innovators like Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), NameCheap and DreamHost on the low end, and Symantec, Google and Amazon on the high end. All of these competitors have similar offerings and features, so I find it fairly ridiculous that GoDaddy spent so much time on the last call touting its own solution.  Firsthand experience shows that the ACME protocol developed and used by Let's Encrypt makes maintaining domain validation completely automatic from one's web server. It has been well-tested, and unlike GoDaddy's implementation, there have been no major problems. Yet the discussion above indicates to me that GoDaddy is behind on ACME, as per Wayne Thayer, General Manager of Security Products:It's important to recognize that automation is far more important than the free aspect because, like domains, certs are a gateway to the hosting & intelligence businesses; anyone with a little tech experience can put a web server on a computer, but they still must go through a third party for domain registration and certification. That's why major web hosting providers like DreamHost, WordPress, Cloudfare and Amazon (AMZN) are already providing free domain certification, many using Let's Encrypt as a back end. The unavoidable conclusion here is that $50-100m of GoDaddy's highest margin annual domain certification revenue is going away permanently. The rest of the Hosting & Presence segment will suffer additional attrition until it follows the market and makes domain certification free, which will have an out-sized effect on the bottom line.  In the meantime, management introduced a sale, as it does whenever market share flags, but preying upon neophytes necessitates pairing discounts with advertising expense. Thus, GoDaddy's return to the NFL's not-so-super finale also increases marketing costs by several million. That won't help margins. Cutting development and operating costs would be one way to go about it, but a sneakier way is to simply change your accounting...Management has always avoided focusing on standard profitability metrics likes EPS, but last quarter it shifted from EBITDA to ""Unlevered Free Cash Flow."" This is dodgy move by any standard because it pretends that interest, amongst other things, is not a cash expense and allows it to be added back in. Tricks like this are why I often assess company health by looking at the balance sheet dynamics over time. Given all the leeway that management gets with acquisition expenses, their annual projections are not surprising, but they don't represent any value for equity holders.Long Term: Acquisition, Balance Sheet and Cash-Out  The purchase of Host Europe Group for €1.69b ($1.82b) is the other move being made to manage the books. The transaction has just closed and in conjunction with it, GoDaddy more than doubled the debt on an already horrendous balance sheet to $2.5b. To my eye, the move has three main purposes:They are demonstrably familiar with tactic #2:   GoDaddy's $3.8b in total assets only narrowly outweighed its $3.2b in total liabilities and a whopping $2.4b (64%) of the former is goodwill and intangibles. I have no doubt there will be some synergies and costs to cut, but it defies imagination to consider how taking out a loan to pay €605m in order to assume €1.08b in additional net debt will result in a profitable combined company, given the current operating model and challenges. The new debt load is still LIBOR based. Predictably, the banks want no part of the debt they are arranging and are syndicating it out to investors.  Management will try to reduce debt by selling off the PlusServer segment of HEG, but that will be a drop in the bucket. HEG's annual report shows that it bought PlusServer along with other assets just a year earlier for €206m. There are many companies that grow the top line at a loss in order to eventually streamline the business and start raking in profits. GoDaddy's history indicates a different business model that doesn't include any such benefits for ordinary shareholders. Instead, I see the company as an early mover in another area. It is one of a growing number of public companies whose real business seems to be enriching management and investment banks by selling stock and debt to patsy investors.  Ancient History: GoDaddy's Origins & Management Record  Jomax Technologies was founded in 1997 by Bob Parsons, with strategic investment from KKR, Silver Lake, Technology Crossover Ventures. The name was changed to ""Go Daddy"" for marketing reasons two years later, and the space was removed from it in 2006, the year after it became the largest ICANN-accredited registrar. GoDaddy filed to IPO that same year, but withdrew soon after. In 2010, it put itself up for auction instead, only to cancel that as well. The following year, the original trio of strategic investors instead bought 65% of the company, reportedly for $2.25b. In 2014, the group unnecessarily ratcheted up the company's debt and interest payments, allocating themselves a $350m dividend in the process. Only after that did GoDaddy finally did complete an IPO in April 2015, with 61.8m shares outstanding. Receiving cash for shares in the IPO is the only point in the company's entire fiscal history that debt declined meaningfully. Yet just one year later management diluted the original shareholders with another offering.   Even before the HEG purchase, management's actions over the years had already saddled the GoDaddy with $14m in quarterly interest expense on $1b in debt. Perhaps the era of infinite financing will last another 7 years, but for GDDY longs, that's only useful if interest rates don't rise and the growth story can be maintained. I think the most likely progression is that the VCs will use the time spent spinning such growth stories to quietly cash out before admitting defeat and letting the company collapse. The trio of KKR, Silver Lake and TCV still nominally owns 36.4% of shares, but the 13F & D ownership stats clearly include double-counting and/or miss offsetting short positions in amounts that just happen to approximately equal that ownership.  Summary and Risk  To my mind, GoDaddy is an example of how excessive capital can subvert technology, destroying value for both customers and investors in the process. Analyst projections for sustainable profitability have GDDY near all-time highs around $38. However, these are based on problematic accounting from shareholder-adverse management and ignore the revolution that is taking place across the web. Analysts were confounded by the EPS and margin miss last quarter, and if anyone does recognize the reason now, they aren't talking about it. Seeking Alpha has documented the inherent conflicts interest at play (see the last paragraph). The reality is that management's actions have never been shareholder-friendly, and while the HEG acquisition gives them room to obfuscate further, it does little to actually solve GoDaddy's problems. Even if markets continue to be sanguine about debt loads, increasing interest rates will hurt the business performance, even as a broken growth story progressively hurts the stock.   The main factors that GoDaddy does have going for it in the meantime are inertia and ignorance. These are powerful forces, not to be ignored, and in a profitable company they might even constitute a reason not to short. As things stand, however, it seems pretty clear that the only way that investors will ever make money from GDDY is via the Greater Fool Theory. To that end, here are some of the possible stories that could be told in addition to the unlevered-FCF nonsense:All of these are stopgap possibilities, but none of them are fixes that can ultimately overcome competition and change. Like all short opportunities, the details will need to be monitored, but I predict erosion of revenue in the Hosting & Presence segment, which almost certainly is company's biggest contributor to the bottom line, will intensify. GoDaddy will eventually be forced to relinquish its domain validation revenue entirely simply to preserve its ability to attract the fledgling business customers that it needs to up-sell. A rising tide lifts all boats, but GoDaddy has been taking on water since the beginning and has just sprung a major new leak. It remains to be seen whether it will capsize or sink, but I suspect the crew is simply out to save themselves."

This piece from February and this one from May both call for a significant drop in shares. Outside of a brief dip in February, partially related to an earnings miss and partially to the entire stock market melting down, the stock has held up well.The shorts point to increased competition, commoditized products, higher customer acquisition costs, as well as the seller overhang from the private equity funds that took GoDaddy public as reasons to be bearish on the stock. I believe these are all largely manageable headwinds that will not derail the GoDaddy growth train.The BusinessGoDaddy is the largest domain business in the world. It has doubled revenues in the last five years and aims to double revenues again over the next five. GoDaddy operates three business segments: Domains, Hosting and Presence and Business Applications.Source: quarterly press releasesEach is on a different growth trajectory. Domains is growing at ~10% annually. Hosting and Presence is growing ~15% annually. The fastest growing part of GoDaddy is Business Applications, which is benefiting from strong sales of Office365, e-mail marketing services, and recent acquisitions.Concerns over the domain registry business due to increased competition and commoditization are overdone. In fact, domains are about to get more lucrative for GoDaddy. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is set to approve 1,300+ new domain name extensions called gTLDs (generic top-level domains). These will be added to the .com, .net, .biz, etc. These new domains are being sold for ~$25 a pop versus the $12-$15 for a .com domain.This will significantly increase revenues and margin for GoDaddy in the longer term. As the leading marketplace for buyers and sellers of domains, GoDaddy stands to significantly benefit from this growing trend as domain owners want the largest audience of potential purchasers when they sell their domains. Domains are growing ~10% annually and have a margin profile of ~35%, though it should show incremental improvement as the gTLDs ramp up due to their higher price point.GoDaddy is much more than a domain registry business. It is also a sophisticated web hosting business that builds and hosts websites in an OpenStack environment. Both professional developers and business owners use GoDaddy's services to easily build websites and power e-commerce with a lot of value-add services, such as payment processing, shipping logistics, QuickBooks integration, and search engine optimization. This business is growing mid-teens and has an excellent gross margin profile at ~70%.GoDaddy's newest business segment is Business Applications. It offers a variety of products designed to make the business of business easier. Primary offerings include email accounts, email marketing and Office 365.GoDaddy has made a few acquisitions recently to round out its offerings, including ManageWP, a WordPress management tool, and FreedomVoice, a cloud-based communications provider for small businesses. This segment is experiencing the highest rate of growth at the company, accelerating the top line at 45-50% annually. It enjoys a gross margin similar to the Hostings and Presence business.Small Business Environment a Big TailwindSmall business optimism has recovered nicely since the great recession.While not as high as it was in the 2000s, it is very supportive of the current level of growth. GoDaddy enjoys tremendous brand awareness thanks to its past marketing campaigns. Working with GoDaddy is one of the first things a new business will do, as gaining a presence on the web is a crucial marketing step.GoDaddy is as well positioned as anyone to capitalize on this movement. As businesses succeed and grow, GoDaddy is there to provide many more value-add services. The company is already capitalizing on this movement, as evidenced by the growing ARPU.Source: quarterly press releasesInternational ExpansionApproximately 26% of revenues are currently coming from outside the US. International sales are growing high teens annually. GoDaddy has put forth considerable resources in recent quarters building out its international capabilities, including adding localized versions of its websites and software in over 50 markets globally. It is ramping up digital marketing across the Americas, Europe and Asia.In 2016, GoDaddy expects most of its overseas growth will come from Canada, the UK, Australia, India, Brazil and Mexico. The company thinks it can continue to grow in its existing international markers with attractive return profiles, while at the same time ramp up its presence in new Asian markets. International should be a positive contributor to top line growth for many years to come.Source: quarterly press releasesProfitabilityTo-date, GoDaddy has not been profitable on a GAAP basis. High depreciation and amortization expense ($161M) and cash interest expense of $47M annually are holding back profitability. The company is leveraged to higher growth in its Hostings and Presence and Business Applications businesses. Both these businesses have gross margins at 70% or higher versus the ~35% margin for Domains.Source: quarterly press releasesTwo years ago, Domains was 56% of total revenues. Today, it is 50%. With Hostings and Presence and Business Applications growing notably faster than Domains, its percent of total sales will continue to drop. That, along with the new gTLD domains coming to market, will help the company achieve GAAP profitability. Consensus sell-side estimates expect GAAP profitability for all of 2017.Source: BloombergGoDaddy's business does generate a lot of free cash flow despite not being GAAP profitable. The reasons for this are two-fold: It has a large amortization expense that runs through the income statement and bookings growth increases cash flow.Source: company filingsGoDaddy has used this impressive free cash flow to reduce debt, bolster its balance sheet and make bolt-on acquisitions. As bookings and revenues continue to grow and profitability improves, so will free cash flow - and likely at an accelerating rate.Private Equity OwnershipGoDaddy IPO'ed on April 1 of last year. It was taken public by its private equity owners: KKR, Silver Lake and Technology Crossover Ventures. They have sold some of their shares, but they still own a large percentage of the float. I expect each of these firms selling down their stake to be a near-term headwind for shares. But if the company continues to post solid results, there will be plenty of demand for shares. For long-term investors, I would not be overly concerned with the near-term price pressure created when each of these entities moves to reduce their stake.Source: BloombergConclusionsGoDaddy is operating in an industry with many secular tailwinds (e-commerce growth, new business formation, outsourcing, efficiency, etc.). While competition is and will continue to be fierce, GoDaddy is well positioned to capture its fair share of growth thanks to its unparalleled name recognition (81% brand awareness in the US) and growing product suite. Between organic and inorganic opportunities, I expect GoDaddy will continue to grow annually in the low-to-mid teens overall.The free cash flow the company generates affords it a lot of financial flexibility. The cash will continue to be used for bolt-on M&A as well as possible debt reductions. GoDaddy may also implement a stock repurchase program to limit dilution from stock-based compensation. Consensus estimates for FY2017 free cash flow are for $384M, up from the expected $311M in 2015.FCF will accelerate as profitability improves. I expect solid results in Q3 and Q4, and the private equity owners can sell into strength if they so choose. The stock has rallied over 15% since Q2 earnings were released. The stock trades at 19.3x LTM FCF. As expectations for 2017 begin to firm up in the next few months, I believe the stock will continue to climb. Even if the multiple falls to 17x in 2017, that implies a 16.5% increase in shares or a $40/share price target.Risks to my thesis include slower international growth, commoditization of the new gTLD domains being sold (pricing falls toward .com domains), a more intense competitive landscape, and quicker than anticipated pace of selling by the private equity owners. I think GoDaddy will effectively manage all these risks, which sets up the shares for a nice potential return over the next twelve months. I would be a buyer at these levels, adding on pullbacks."

The tangible book value of equity is the difference: $-1.8 billion or $-11.28/share. GoDaddy has $2.4 billion of goodwill and intangible assets. If we believe in the value of these intangibles, the book value of equity increases to $4.05/share. This analysis shows that proper valuation of this company requires a thorough valuation of the company's brand and profitable growth prospects.Let's look at growth in the table below. Revenue growth is expected to decline to 16% in 2015 from around 23-25% in 2013 and 2014. Customer growth also slowed from 14% in 2012 to around 9% in 2014.Source: GoDaddy 10-Q filed November 5, 2015 and GoDaddy's Q3 2015 Earnings Call Investor Presentation.This slowdown in top line growth is concerning since so much value is in the intangible assets. Note that reported revenues on the income statement represent growth with a lag because the income statement does not include the deferred revenues that have not been earned yet. The growth in deferred revenues declined from 38% in 2012 to 15% in 2014.A discounted cash flow analysis suggests shares are worth about $12/share. Let's take the LTM (Sept 30, 2015) unlevered free cash flow of $170 million (source: Capital IQ and filings) and do a simple perpetuity valuation. Assuming a 12% discount rate and a 5% long run growth rate, I get a perpetuity value of $16/share of future asset value. I subtract $4.5/share of net debt to get about $12/share.Clearly, GoDaddy's value depends largely on the value of GoDaddy's brand and growth prospects. As of this article, GoDaddy's stock trades around $30/share with a market value of equity of $4.5 billion. My expectation that the price will decline to $15 by 2017 points to a 50% downside. Let's see if GoDaddy's industry and position justify a higher expected growth in free cash flows.GoDaddy's IndustryGoDaddy describes the industry as ""highly fragmented"" with many vendors providing part of the solution (domain registration versus hosting versus website development) and ""highly competitive"" with many existing competitors. Competition is not a friend of any business.Competition is increasing in both the domain registration and hosting markets. Some of the many domain registration competitors include NameSilo, NameCheap, Name.com and Domain.com. Substantially all of the cost of revenues for GoDaddy relate to domain registration fees paid to the various domain registries and to ICANN, payment processing fees and third-party commissions. GoDaddy lacks control over the fees charged and does not gain economies of scale with respect to cost of revenues.Competitors in web hosting include HostGator, DreamHost, Hostwinds, Bluehost, hostMonster and SiteGround. GoDaddy does not have any pricing power in hosting. Competitors all charge prices between $3-$7 per month and GoDaddy charges $4/month. Competitive pressures should drive these prices to their marginal costs, so I don't see hosting itself as a promising business.Also, hosting is a capital intensive business. One has to purchase, maintain and update servers and provide customer support. These capital expenditures are necessary to reduce the latency someone experiences when accessing a website and increasing uptime of websites. There is a saying that good technology companies ""don't own stuff"" because the continuous hardware improvements mixed with competition are expensive. GoDaddy owns 55,000 servers around the world.Competitors in cloud services include the big players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, for GoDaddy, Google and Microsoft have other incentives, notably to attract customers to their ecosystems because they have dominant positions in internet marketing. Google and Microsoft may be willing to compete strongly on price to capture existing and new customers and have deeper talent and financial resources with which to do so.In this competitive industry, GoDaddy has to grow by being an aggressive marketer. GoDaddy spent around 12-14% of revenues on marketing activities from 2012 through 2015. This consistent spending represents a cost of maintaining GoDaddy's market share and brand. Nevertheless, growth in revenues and customers is slowing suggesting that GoDaddy needs to spend more to protect its market share.GoDaddy's industry is evolving rapidly, and GoDaddy thus faces the continuous threat of innovation. Large companies tend to not be the ones that develop the new breakthroughs. New competitors enter the market with each wave of innovation. GoDaddy has to either acquire the competitors or spend the resources to develop the technology to have a competitive product that will eventually be commoditized.Google Entered Domain RegistrationContributing to the slowdown of GoDaddy is the rise of Google in domain management. In January 2015, Google opened their domain registration service to the public in the United States. Google's domain registration is still listed as a ""beta"" offering, which may deter some customers from using Google. Also because Google's product is only in the United States, the ramifications for GoDaddy in the international markets have not been felt. As Google's offering becomes more established and available in 2016, the ramifications for GoDaddy will increase.The pricing and feel of Google's domain registration system is simple: $12 per year buys a domain, free private registration and 100 free branded email addresses. Private registration keeps your name, address and phone number out of the public WHOIS database.Let's look at GoDaddy's prices for the same services. GoDaddy charges $15/yr for domain registration, $8/yr for private registration and $5/month for branded emails. This similar offering costs a GoDaddy customer $83/year. Google's pricing pressure will further squeeze GoDaddy's margins. Also, customers who bought domains from GoDaddy were more likely to buy other services from GoDaddy, but Google is competing directly with GoDaddy at this important customer acquisition point.A key point is that Google has strong incentives to enter the market. The domain registration service integrates nicely with its analytics, email and AdSense offerings and Google also has the most servers in the world. As many businesses rely on Google already for winning traffic and advertising, switching to Google can simplify managing their web presence. I think Google is increasingly interested in making sure that small businesses developing a web presence live in Google's ecosystem.I see many of the following types of customer reviews:Google is now battling in GoDaddy's domain, and Google has a lot more value to bring to the table. We can expect to see Google Domains expand offerings in the coming years.Catalysts for a Downward Price MoveIn conclusion, I think GoDaddy's stock price will decline to around $15 by 2017, representing a 50% downside from a current price of $30/share. GoDaddy likes to focus investor attention on its growth (see Q3 2015 investor presentation), but I am not convinced that the growth will be profitable.An important upcoming catalyst is the open session after the earnings announcement on February 17, 2016. GoDaddy filed an S-1 registration statement on November 25, 2015 that indicates that holders of LLC Units can exchange those shares for Class A common stock and sell those shares on the open market. Class A shares outstanding would increase from 65.5 million to 157.3 million if all LLC units were exchanged. Legal restrictions on insiders (includes 10% owners) likely are delaying sales until the next open sessions. The first open session since the S-1 follows the earnings announcement on February 17, 2016.Another catalyst is that the stronger U.S. dollar will slow down GoDaddy's higher growth international business. Competition from Europe, India or Asia can compete more aggressively on price since their currencies are devalued relative to the dollar.Some potential upcoming catalysts in 2016 with respect to Google's entry include: removing the Beta designation and allowing registration by international customers.How to TradeI would recommend adding GoDaddy to a diversified short portfolio. For the upcoming earnings release, I would leverage my short position using short-term put options expiring on May 19, 2016. The May 19, 2016 puts will capitalize on the post-earnings announcement drift and any selling by pre-IPO holders during the subsequent open sessions."

GoDaddy has 13.8 million customers that are small businesses, entrepreneurs, universities, charities and hobbyists and many other individuals. There is a large runway for this business to grow with approximately 60% of small businesses not having a website and the increasing importance of having a dynamic web presence. GoDaddy is projected to grow revenue over 14% over the next two years, but its valuation at 1.9 times projected forward revenue is at a slight premium relative to its peer set, despite being unprofitable. GoDaddy is an attractive business opportunity, which we will outline further, but we urge investors to consider waiting until the valuation looks more attractive and the effects of the follow-on are fully appreciated in the stock price.GoDaddy provides a comprehensive suite of small business solutions, including marketing and email solutions. GoDaddy has had a core of its revenue within the United States but recently announced its large expansion into the Asian market. We see this as a strong positive given the Asian market is home to one of the most vibrant small business communities within the world. With Internet access and smartphone adoption expanding within the region, it will be increasingly important for businesses to develop strong digital identities to achieve their goals. We also believe the investment to enter new markets will not be terribly large given the existing infrastructure of the GoDaddy platform. Currently only 26% of bookings in 2015 were from international accounts, representing an enormous runway for the company to expand this segment of their business.GoDaddy recently announced a follow-on offering with a large number of existing shareholders cashing out some of their investment in the business (see capitalization table below). We note however that most investors are still holding a substantial equity stake in the company which is somewhat comforting. However, we feel this offering might place some downward pressure on the stock in the near term. Some of this downward pressure could arise from the shares now being easier to short (Yahoo Finance states roughly 50% of shares were held short prior to the offering). The chart below shows the high short interest in the stock, which will possibly increase now as the cost of shorting declines with a larger float.GoDaddy Stock Chart CapitalIQSource: Company ProspectusIn order to value GoDaddy we looked for other domain and hosting providers with a strong presence within the United States. We performed comparable company analysis and found that GoDaddy trades roughly in line with its peers at around two times revenue versus its peer set at 2.4 times revenue. We feel the stock should trade around its current valuation given its lack of profitability versus Web.com (NASDAQ:WEB) and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), despite having slightly higher top line growth. Thus we would look for a steeper valuation discount to its peer set prior to initiating a long position or the company generating a similar profit profile.Source: Author Analysis/CapitalIQOverall GoDaddy offers investors the ability to invest in the rapid expansion of small businesses and own stock in a company with an 85% customer retention rate. However, given the recent follow-on offering and the in line valuation with the company's peers, we feel investors should wait for a better entry point to purchase shares. This is a great business for investors to keep on their radar in the coming months though, especially on a broader technology sell-off."
4048930,98656,2017-02-23T12:50:57-05:00,"Should Donald Trump remove the Dodd-Frank, we expect to see sustained small business growth.As small businesses are the lifeblood of the GoDaddy business we expect demand for its services to increase.We expect to see revenue continue to grow strongly through to at least FY 2018.This could result in strong gains for shareholders over the next 18 months.","Whilst President Trump hasn't given much away in regard to infrastructure and corporate tax plans, he has certainly let the market know that he's not a fan of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. If the president has his way then the Act will soon be removed, leading to easier access to money for small businesses and start-ups across the United States. We agree with Trump and feel its removal will stimulate small business growth and lead to certain small business-focused companies profiting greatly. One such company is small business web development giant GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY).Despite the fact that internet has been mainstream for over two decades, a huge number of small businesses have still not developed an online presence. Last year a survey of 350 small businesses with less than 10 employees and under $1 million of annual sales, by research firm Clutch , found that 46% of U.S. small businesses didn't have a website for their company. The number one reason given for the lack of a website was a lack of a technical know-how. Whilst you might think that having a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page was another key reason for this, but in fact just 12% of those surveyed said they use social media instead of a static website.We think this is a huge opportunity for a company like GoDaddy. As a leader in domain name registration, website building, and web and email hosting, we believe GoDaddy is in a perfect position to continue to deliver solid organic growth for the next couple of years at least. And that's as things stand now, as we will go on to explain, if Donald Trump scraps the Dodd-Frank we expect small businesses to be given a huge boost. We believe this will result in stronger demand for GoDaddy's portfolio of products.On the table below you can see GoDaddy's performance in the last three years with our forecast, ceteris paribus, for the next couple of years.Source: Company data, and author's forecasts.However, as we stated previously, we believe if President Trump's repeal on the Dodd-Frank goes ahead, then companies with exposure to the small business community stand to benefit greatly.The reason for this is that under the Dodd-Frank, banks have been issued larger reserve requirements which has made it harder for them to lend to start-ups and small to medium-sized businesses. We share the view of President Trump that this has had a negative impact on the small to medium-sized business community and ultimately the American economy.As you can see by the chart above, the Small Business Lending Index is currently below pre-GFC levels. However, in comparison, commercial and industrial loans have increased by 31 per cent since the Global Financial Crisis and shows no signs of slowing.Source: FREDWill the Dodd-Frank make a difference?We believe that if the Dodd-Frank was removed by Trump it would result in easier access to lending for small businesses. This in turn should result in a vibrant small business community and an increasing number of start-ups. Such conditions are perfect for a company like GoDaddy and as a result we expect an increase in demand for its services.Our forecast for GoDaddy's revenue growth through to 2018 changes if the Dodd-Frank is scrapped. In the table below you will see that we have predicted a slight increase in the rise of customers, average revenue per user [APRU] and revenue, all as a result of relaxed lending criteria. Because we think it could take lenders a few months to adapt to the new lending regulations (if the Act is scrapped), we think FY 2018 will be when GoDaddy really starts to benefit.Source: Company data, and author's forecasts.As the company is just edging into profitability, we believe the best way to value GoDaddy's shares at this point in time is on a price-to-sales ratio. As you can see below, in the limited time it has been listed on the stock market, its shares have had a tendency to change hands at a reasonable 1.6x sales.The other component we need to value the shares on a PS ratio is its shares outstanding. At present there are 96.74 million shares outstanding, but we expect this to rise to 98 million by the end of FY 2017 and 102 million by 2018.Based on the aforementioned sales multiple, our prediction for shares outstanding, and finally our revenue forecast for GoDaddy (with the Dodd-Frank scrapped), we believe the fair value for its shares is currently $36.32, rising to $41.09 in FY 2018. Whilst there may not be a great deal of gains ahead this year, we believe that patient investors will be reward with an 11.8% gain by FY 2018.Overall, we feel GoDaddy is a solid investment and one that stands to benefit greatly from President Trump's plan to remove the Dodd-Frank."
3857866,95066,2016-02-02T18:15:38-05:00,"Shares of GoDaddy have been available for almost a year.GoDaddy has performed very well compared to the market.In terms of growth, GoDaddy is forecast to see excellent earnings growth as well as revenue growth.However, they need to find a way to operate net income at a profit.","GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) is an internet domain company that we are all becoming familiar with. The company produces tons of commercials that we see on all programs, especially during the football season. They have over 61 million domain names, which makes the company the largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world. It is very popular among small businesses looking for an e-mail provider. This company IPO'd almost a year ago in April 2015, and so far has performed well. This article will first discuss how the stock has performed in comparison with the S&P 500. Then, I will go into discussing company financials - the ""go"" and the ""no"" if you will. From these trends and reports, I will draw my conclusion on a long-term investment in shares of GoDaddy.GDDY vs. S&P 500You can see that the graph above shows a good year compared to the S&P 500 index. GoDaddy is up 16.6% compared to the index for the market which is almost down to -3% since last year. When looking into how a stock has been trending in the last five days, investors can still find GoDaddy is performing twice as better as market expectations. When a company is outperforming its surrounding market, this is typically a good thing to reflect on. The best stock picks rest above these market trends. Since GoDaddy has seen growth favoring this trend in the past year, investors should buy in while shares are reasonably priced. Since its IPO, the company has seen the stock price reach over $35 a share. It currently rests at about $30 a share, which is still upwards from their $26 buy in at IPO. As long as GoDaddy continues to perform on par or better than the S&P 500, the share price should continue to grow in value in the future.Financials - The ""Go""The above graph displays quarterly revenue for the past two years. Any potential investor would want to look for a company that consistently increases revenue on a quarterly and/or a yearly basis. As you can see, GoDaddy has been following this positive trend in consecutive quarters. Revenue has increased 4.21% from Q2-2015 to Q3-2015 and over $100 million in a year and a half. Aside from reflecting on revenue, the consensus forecast for GoDaddy's earnings growth is looking sharp as well. By the end of 2016, earnings are expected to increase by 78%. A year after that, they are expected to surpass well over 100%. The future estimates average out to 21% growth in the next five years. The graph below demonstrates this increase in earnings:Financials - The ""No""Although revenue has been increasing in most recent quarters, the graph above displays that GoDaddy has been operating their net income at a loss. In the case of GoDaddy, it is important to recognize this loss, especially since the past couple years they have recorded an annual income at -$100 million. If potential investors plan on adding this stock for the next couple of years, it is important to keep an eye on this company's net income. It is unfavorable to invest in a company that is operating at consecutive quarterly losses, especially if one is looking for company growth for the long-term. If GoDaddy plans on being a powerhouse at any point in the future, they must find a way to cut cost of goods sold and operate at a profit. Once they fix this problem, this should create solutions for other gray areas within the company. Earnings per share, for example, has been underperforming as of recently. The graph below displays this phenomenon, showing that every quarter has fallen below zero with no signs of going positive until September 2016..Conclusion - Go or NoGoDaddy does tons of advertising in a variety of creative ways, but one thing they have in common is getting their brand name across to potential customers. Customer growth has increased about 9% this past year and they now serve just over 13 million people. Their prospecting techniques are starting to pay off due to their revenue growing with customers. With the powerful brand they have created and a bulk of the market share, GoDaddy has set themselves up for an exciting opportunity to grow in the future. However, it will not be a smooth ride. In order to achieve success, they must find a way to operate net income at a profit or else there will be no thoughts of a long-term investment at all for shareholders. Even though they are not currently generating a profit, GoDaddy seems to be moving away from a loss in recent quarters. Given that and the positive forecast financials of the company, I say that investing in shares of GoDaddy is a GO."
3525276,39791,2015-09-22T18:02:58-04:00,Provides services that are not commoditized and faces high competition.High valuations do not support company fundamentals and low entry barriers.The company has not managed to generate profits despite being the industry leader.,"GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is one of the most popular domain name registrars and web hosting service providers in the world today. The company has more than 13 million customers, providing products and support in 37 countries. Though the company gave a good set of results in its most recent quarter, I am still not very bullish on the stock due to its inability to generate profits.GoDaddy competes with the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the technology space, with start-ups entering its domain as well. The stock in my view is still highly overvalued, given the lack of specialized services it provides. It is concerning that GoDaddy, while being a leading industry name, is unable to generate profits in a relatively mature industry. Given the high competition, lack of profitability and low entry barriers, GDDY is not a buy at the current price.Stock Downsides1) Lack of Differentiation - GoDaddy suffers greatly because of a lack of product differentiation. The company mainly provides web hosting and domain name registration services to its clients. While the domain registry business has expanded by leaps and bounds and will continue to do so in the future, GoDaddy has not been successful in selling value-added services. Though the company started email marketing services, it remains a very small part of the whole business. According to Domain Hosting Services, GoDaddy ranked 8th for the year 2015. This shows that many organization offer similar services in the market, and if GoDaddy does not diversify into unique services, it might lose its market share.2) Not Profitable - Though revenues have increased over the years, the company has been unable to generate profits. The major component of cost is the sales and general expenses that have been increasing steeply over the years.(Figures in million $)Data from Morningstar & GoDaddy3) High Competition - As I mentioned above, GoDaddy provides services that are not specialized and operates in a highly commoditized industry. This has led to price wars among peers. The company faces competitive pressures not only from new ventures providing similar services but also from giants like Google. With the advent of Google's Google Domain, clients have access to a more integrated product and service offerings. Google is a technology giant that can provide a host of services in addition to web hosting. The scenario is highly competitive with peers offering many services at affordable prices. Amazon's Route 53 has already started providing web hosting services and Microsoft also plans to enter this segment. I think GoDaddy will have a tough time handling the pressure from these technology giants.4) High Valuation - The company has a market capitalization value of ~$4 billion, with a P/B of 11x compared to the industry average of 4.4x. Though the stock price has corrected slightly and is currently trading at ~$25, I still believe there is a lot of scope for improvement. The company had a debt of $1.09 billion against a cash balance of $295 million at the second-quarter end. The current valuation does not support the company's dismal performance.Upside Risksa) Good Quarterly Performance - In the last quarter, GoDaddy showed improvement in almost all its metrics other than net income. The company posted Q2'15 revenues of $394.5 million which was above consensus. Customers rose by 200K on a quarterly and 1.1 million on an annual basis to 13.3 million. However, the company spends quite a lot on its customer support and marketing services, leading to losses. Q2 loss per share was 46 cents, missing consensus by 29 cents.b) The company is trying hard to offer new services through acquisitions - GoDaddy acquired Marchex, Nodejitsu and Elto in 2015. Elto is a start-up which offers a marketplace to connect small business owners to web developers for improving their online presence. Marchex is a call driven mobile advertising technology company and Nodejitsu provides server-side JavaScript framework. The company is trying hard to expand into new service offerings through the inorganic route. However, the success of these numerous acquisitions remains to be seen.Stock PerformanceThe stock is currently trading at ~$25 which is 20% above its 52-week low price. The stock lost ~4% YTD when its peer Web.com (WWWW) gained more than 14%.Source: Google FinanceConclusionGoDaddy has more than 60 million domain names under management and is amongst the industry leaders. However, the company is still not generating profits. It provides services that are not specialized and competes with the industry giants in the technology space. I feel with more and more companies getting into this line of business, prices are bound to go down leading to price wars and thereby reducing GoDaddy's chances of being profitable. However, the company gave a decent quarterly performance and is acquiring smaller companies to diversify. I think that GoDaddy will take some time before it establishes itself as a profitable technology company. The valuation seems high given the above issues, hence I would advise investors to stay on the sidelines."

The company has over 13 million customers with over 60 million domains under management. The company provides an array of web hosting and domain registration services such as initial registration, transfer and renewal of domain names with .COM, .NET, .ORG, .BIZ, .INFO AND .US domains. In addition, the company offers sales and marketing software, e-commerce solutions, website design and creation and other cloud-based services surrounding website management.GoDaddy stock fell in August by 11.8 percent and ended the month off 24 percent from its high of $31.82 in June. Currently, however, at just above $24.50, the stock trades above its initial price of $20.(Nasdaq.com)Mixed Results in AugustGoDaddy announced its second quarterly results as a publicly traded company in early August. Analysts had predicted a net loss of around $0.17 per share on revenue of around $393 million. The company exceeded the revenue expectations with $395 million in sales; however, EPS results were a disappointing loss of $0.46 per unit. The day after that announcement, shares in GoDaddy declined by 11 percent.The stock recovered a bit by the end of August, coinciding with an interview conducted by Business Insider with CEO Blake Irving. The article cast GoDaddy in a positive light, much like an innovative newcomer rather than an 18 year old, maturing company.A significant portion of the Q2 losses resulted from early debt extinguishment fees, as GoDaddy paid down $300 million of its debt to improve its balance sheet. The company reduced its long-term debt to $1.05 billion, and without the additional expenses, the net loss reported would have been closer to a loss of $0.13 per share.Second Quarter 2015 Financial HighlightsFULL RESULTS HERE.Management Team: Bringing Experience From Yahoo! and other Tech GiantsPrior to joining GoDaddy, CEO and Board Director Blake Irving was EVP and Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

3183526,76475,2015-05-15T12:43:10-04:00,"GoDaddy delivered its first quarterly results since going public in April.Most of the company’s growth metrics improved in double digits.The company’s losses fell by a significant margin.GoDaddy shares are likely to perform well in the current year.The suitability of the shares for a long-term position, however, remains doubtful.","Leading web registration and hosting services provider, GoDaddy, Inc. (NYSE:GDDY) released its first quarterly results since its April IPO. There was actually a lot to like about GoDaddy's results. The company's revenue ramped up 17.5% while the company posted a narrower net loss of $43.4 million compared to a loss of $51.3 million posted during the prior year.All the company's segments grew in double digits: the core domains registration segment (53% of revenue) grew 10.4% while website hosting services (37% of revenue), a natural complement to the company's domains business, expanded 21.2%. It was, however, the company's business applications segment (10% of revenue) that caught my attention. GoDaddy is one of the biggest resellers of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office 365 suite. Business applications brought in $36.9 million for the company after growing 53%. The fast growth being exhibited by this segment is great for the company because it's helping to offset slower growth by the domains business. Meanwhile, total customers were up 9.3% to 13.1 million while ARPU increased 9.6% to $115.Even though GoDaddy's shares popped 30% on the day of its IPO, investors have generally been cautious about playing new entrants into the markets this year due to the disappointing performance of cloud storage company Box (NYSE:BOX) whose shares have plunged 25.7% since its January IPO. But I don't believe GoDaddy will go down that road; at least not in the near-term. GoDaddy shares are currently trading 33.85% above their $20 IPO price.Decent Top Line GrowthGoDaddy can hardly be classified a growth company since it has been in existence for 18 years. But I think the company's top line growth is impressive for an 18-year old company, especially when you consider that the company is considered the largest player in the space with about 25% market share. Its close peer, Web.com (WWWW) has been growing much slower, and saw its revenue contract 1% during the first quarter of the current fiscal year to $132.6 million. That says something about the brand power of GoDaddy. In fact GoDaddy's brand equity and recognition are reputed to be among the highest in the tech industry. It's quite likely that GoDaddy is growing at Web.com's expense. Not only has Web.com's overall revenue started falling, but its ARPU has been on a decline too.GoDaddy's rapidly growing business application segment will provide a nice boost to the company's top line and help to offset weaknesses in its core domains registration business which might slow down as the years roll on.The good part though is that there is still plenty of room to run for GoDaddy. The U.S. Small Business Administration says that there are more than 30 million businesses in the U.S. with less than 5 employees, and most of these tiny businesses have little or no technological skills. A recent Gartner study found that about half of small businesses do not even have a basic website. GoDaddy currently has 13 million customers. The company still has plenty of room to run in the U.S., not to mention its international markets where it derives 25% of its revenue and where growth is faster than in its domestic market.Operating Expenses are SubduedLooking at GoDaddy's financial statement, it's hard to point to point at any single line item as being responsible for the company's losses. For growth companies in the tech sector, marketing expenses, R&D as well as stock-based executive compensation expenses are usually the biggest drags on profitability. Sales and marketing expenses of many young tech companies are usually north of 50% of revenue. GoDaddy's numbers for all three metrics are very favorable: sales and marketing constitute 13.5% of revenue; R&D accounts for 18% of revenue and stock-based executive compensation is just 2.3% of revenue, in line with most mature tech companies which dole out 2%-3% of revenue as stock-based executive compensation.The best part, however, is that GoDaddy's operating expenses grew just 12% to $396.8 million, 550 basis points slower than top line growth. Cost of revenue grew just 9% to $137.2 million. As long as GoDaddy is able to maintain the current momentum, it stands a good chance of turning from the red to the black in as little 6 quarters.GoDaddy's Value as a Long-Term Holding Is QuestionableGoDaddy's first quarterly report was pretty decent by many counts. Still the question lingers why an 18-year old tech company is still making losses at this stage of its growth cycle. There is one particular company that bears an eerie similarity to GoDaddy's case - Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI). Angie's List was 16 years old when it listed for its IPO in 2011. Just like GoDaddy, Angie's List was reputed to have never made a profit during its 16-year existence. Unfortunately, this streak extended into the company's public life.Angie's List shares debuted at $13 and went to hit an all-time high of $26 in 2013.Source: CNN MoneyBut investors soon grew tired of the company's mounting losses and started exiting in droves. Angie's List shares have been cut in half since they started trading four years ago.I would rather wait at the sidelines and watch if GoDaddy's losses will continue coming down before taking a long-term position. I'm also aware of the stratospheric valuation of the company's shares - its EV/EBITDA ratio of about 23 dwarfs Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) reading of 15. The market tend to get very jittery when a company with such a valuation shows any signs of slowing growth--just look at what has happened to Yelp. I will therefore keep the company in my radar and see how it performs for the rest of the year. But so far so good."
3206376,39791,2015-05-23T14:01:50-04:00,GoDaddy’s valuation is too high compared to peers and its growth profile.The company operates mainly in providing commodity web services which have low margins and require a large investment in sales and marketing.It faces potential competition threats from large technology giants such as Google.,"GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is one of the world's largest providers of web hosting and domain naming services. The company has 13 million clients across the globe with an Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of $115. The company gave its first quarterly results after its recent IPO, where it reported revenue and EBITDA growth of ~17% from a year ago. The revenue growth came through a mix of growth in both volumes (increase in number of customers) and price (ARPU). However, total bookings came in slower at 13%. GoDaddy competes in a mainly commoditized industry where it sells domain names and web hosting services. There's not a lot of differentiation in this industry, which leads to a lot of price competition. That being said, GoDaddy has a well-recognized brand name in the industry for providing good services at affordable prices. However I think that the company's valuation at ~$4 billion is a bit too high, given that the company is not creating profits. The growth rate of around 15% also is not inspiring, given the company only provides basic internet services. I would avoid GoDaddy at the current stock price of ~$26-27 and wait for much lower prices before considering the stock as a buy.GoDaddy negatives1) Valuation and Debt - I think that GoDaddy can be an attractive investment but at a much lower price. The company's stock price has jumped by more than 30%, since it did its IPO at $20. The company is not making a profit, though it is generating a free cash flow of more than $100 million. The valuation at more than $4 billion is a bit too high for a company that's operating at moderate margins and does not have a great growth profile either. The company's underwriters are coming out with favorable sell side reports, despite no favorable catalysts. GoDaddy has a net debt of around ~$850 million which is a bit high considering the technology sector. Though it does not face any liquidity risk, this means that the company's enterprise value is more near $5 billion. Its EV/EBITDA ratio is quite high at more than 10x. The company's P/B ratio at 10.6x is at a ~50% premium to its listed competitor web.com (WWWW).GDDY Price to Book Value data by YCharts2) High spend on customer support and marketing - GoDaddy sells small value services to a large diversified customer base spread across many countries. The company's sales and marketing expense is quite high as the company has to spend a lot of money to acquire new customers. Its customer acquisition costs are extremely high, lowering the return ratios for the company. The company spent almost $150 million in the current quarter on customer care, marketing and administrative expense. This forms more than 40% of the company's revenues.3) Low value commodity services - GoDaddy is in the business of selling mostly domain names and web hosting services. Both of these services are low value added activities without high entry barriers. It is mostly a commodity business, in which you can mostly differentiate through pricing and a little bit by offering better service quality. Switching between hosting providers is not a big hurdle for most customers. GoDaddy is diversifying into providing additional services such as email marketing, web designing and other web services. However, the domain name and web hosting services constitute almost 90% of its revenues.4) Potential competition from technology giants - Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has entered the domain naming services sector and it has started testing its beta for US-based customers. Google has extensive reach into the SME sector and has a lot of web services that it can offer as an integrated offering. Google has a deep understanding and data on the global internet thanks to the dominance of its internet search. The company can offer email services, web marketing and analytics along with domain name and web hosting services. GoDaddy will be hard pressed to match the web services provided by Google. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two other technology giants which offer similar services. Their reach and size is much greater than GoDaddy. Many service providers such as those in the mapping and news areas have seen markets collapse, with the entry of these technology companies providing better and cheaper services. Go Daddy's future depends on Google not investing too much of its money and intellectual capital in this area.GoDaddy PositivesStock Price PerformanceGoDaddy stock has increased by ~35% since its IPO last month and trades near its all-time high of ~$27. I think that the company's valuation is a bit too high considering its fundamentals.GDDY data by YChartsSummaryGoDaddy is a good company that has done well to establish itself as the leader in providing domain names and web hosting services. The company has a large client base to whom it can sell additional web services such as marketing, analytics, email, etc. However, the business of providing domain names and web hosting is not a high-margin business. The growth profile of the company also is not high enough to justify its $4 billion plus market valuation. While this area is too small for the likes of Google and Amazon to become too aggressive, investors should keep in mind that these companies are already present in this space. If these companies suddenly change their strategy, then GoDaddy will see its high valuation quickly collapse. I would look to avoid GoDaddy at its current stock price."
3744116,25120,2015-12-09T11:03:54-05:00,"GoDaddy is expanding its domain name portfolio as it continues to improve services for its clients.Shares have seen a real momentum run in recent weeks following solid third-quarter results.Based on the valuation, leverage employed, and potential growth scenarios in the future, I fail to understand why the market attaches a high valuation to the firm.For these reasons, I would approach shares from the short side, considering a small short allocation.","Shares of GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) rose to fresh highs following the news that the company acquired a domain portfolio. Shares of the domain name and hosting provider have enjoyed some real momentum following its third-quarter earnings report.I believe that shares are trading at very elevated valuation multiples, even if I take into account the strong topline growth being reported. Based on the current losses, leveraged balance sheet and limited capital gains based on future scenarios, I would refrain from taking a stake in the business. If anything, I would prefer to approach the stock from the short side.Improving Its ServicesGoDaddy has acquired a domain name portfolio consisting out of some 70,000 domain names which the company will make available for its customers to buy. While this looks like a large deal, in reality it is not. GoDaddy has 13 million customers and over 61 million domain names, which pretty much implies that its inventory of domain names will increase by 0.1% as a result of the deal.While the deal is relatively small, it illustrates how GoDaddy continues to improve its offerings for its clients.Solid Momentum RunGoDaddy continues to report healthy growth rates, as seen by the third-quarter earnings report which was released a few weeks ago. Third-quarter sales were up 15.2% to $411.1 million, as topline sales grew by 16.4% in the first nine moths of the year. Growth has been supported by an 8.8% increase in the customer base to 13.6 million as annualized revenue per user (ARPU) was up 6.8% to $119 per customer.The company continues to expect solid topline sales growth for the immediate future. GoDaddy expects that fourth-quarter revenues will increase by some 1%.Looking At The PotentialAt the moment, GoDaddy has 13.6 million customers, as the company has added roughly a million customers over the past year. Roughly two-thirds of these customers are located within the US and the remainder are located overseas. The company itself claims that it holds roughly a fifth of the global domain market, as it has some 61 million domains being registered.Let's assume that GoDaddy can continue to grow the customer base by a million a year for many years to come. In such a case, it could have a customer base of 30 million by 2030. Of course, this prediction is highly uncertain given the long time frame involved and the rapid developments in the industry. If I assume that ARPU will increase by 3-4% per year, ARPU could total $200 per customer by the year 2030. If this is somewhat realistic, revenues could come in around $6 billion by 2030.At the moment, the company is still failing to report a profits on its current revenue base. Operating losses are now equivalent to 3-4% of sales, but they have been narrowing rather quickly in recent years. It should furthermore be stressed that the cost base is ""real"" and not being heavily inflated through one-time costs or very high amortization charges.So What Can Future Margins Look Like?There are a few other companies listed on the stock exchange which are active in providing domain registration services and hosting solutions. Web.com (NASDAQ:WEB) is valued at roughly $1.6 billion, including its debt load, equivalent to 3 times the trailing revenue base of $540 million. Web.com has been profitable for three years now, as operating margins have improved to roughly 10%.With GoDaddy being roughly three times as large in terms of sales at the current moment, I would believe that operating margins could expand to 20% in a favorable future scenario. That means that operating profits could come in at $1.2 billion by 2030 under these assumptions. An unleveraged business could post after-tax earnings of around $750 million in that case, supporting a $13-$15 billion valuation if all goes well.Note that at the moment, at current levels of $34 per share, equity of GoDaddy is valued at $5.3 billion. The company furthermore has a net debt position of little over $700 million for a current enterprise valuation of $6.0 billion, equivalent to roughly 4 times sales. This means that the company trades at a premium compared to Web.com despite a lack of profits.That means that if all goes well, the value of the business could increase by some 130% in the coming fifteen years, translating into potential capital gains of 5-6% per year through 2030. This is only the case if the company can execute on this growth scenario.These are just very modest potential returns, certainly if I take into account the large risks related to the execution on this growth strategy. This is certainly the case as the company remains highly leveraged at the moment, is not yet profitable, and faces a lot of (potential) competition.Final ThoughtsIt is clear by now that GoDaddy is not a long candidate at current levels in my perspective for all the reasons mentioned. The potential ways to initiate a short position are limited as well. Options in the company carry quite some premium as only relatively short maturities are available to trade upon.The conclusion is clear. Shares are not suitable for any traditional value investors, not even for growth investors in my opinion. I would approach the shares with a great deal of caution, and potentially consider a very modest short allocation through the shares, although I realize the risks for momentum to continue."
3044186,70065,2015-04-01T04:04:32-04:00,GoDaddy's IPO has been priced at $20/share.This is in line with my estimate of intrinsic value based on analysis of prospectus data (yawn).I would only be interested in the stock if it trades above $30 (short) or below $16 (long).,"GoDaddy (Pending:GDDY) has priced its IPO at $20/share. What does this mean for investors who are considering buying shares in the secondary market? Was the IPO fairly priced? How much could an investor expect to earn, and should they go long or short? These are the questions I have endeavored to answer by analyzing the data contained in the IPO prospectus.Historical DataGoDaddy provided three years of historical data in the prospectus, which is just barely long enough to see the recent trend. Revenue grew at 24% in 2013 compared to 2012, and 23% in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating profit has been negative all three years, but at a steadily lower percentage, improving from negative 22% in 2012 to negative 4% in 2014. Net income has also been negative all three years, but the trend has been improving from negative 31% in 2012 to negative 10% in 2014.After adjusting net income for non-cash items, we arrive at operating cash flow. In this case, we add back depreciation, equity-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital. The result is operating cash flow of $106 million in 2012, $153 million in 2013 and $180 million in 2014. Operating cash flow has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of 30% from 2012 to 2014.Capital expenditures have been steady over the three years, growing from $44 million in 2012 to $67 million in 2014. This gets us to levered free cash flow of $62 million in 2012, $101 million in 2013 and $113 million in 2014.ForecastWhile the historical numbers are ""interesting"", the value of GoDaddy is in its future, not its past. The historical figures are useful in identifying the trends, and thus, have helped shape this forecast.Based on GoDaddy's already large scale and market share, I expect revenue growth to continue at a lower rate. I expect revenue growth to steadily decelerate from 23% in 2014 to 5% in 2019.Operating costs should improve as a percentage of revenue as economies of scale and operating efficiencies kick in. Operating costs have been steadily declining, and I expect operating profit to trend from negative 4% in 2014 to positive 11% in 2019.Non-cash items are expected to more or less continue past trends. Changes in working capital will eventually normalize at $0, and capex is assumed to continue to grow at a manageable rate.Summary of AnalysisBelow is a summary of the valuation analysis.(Source: Analysis by author)ValuationBased on the above analysis, we can now calculate the net present value of the levered cash flow and arrive the intrinsic value per share.Key assumptions for the DCF analysis are:Taking the above assumptions into account, I arrive at a net present value for equity of $3,291 million, and when dividend by 151 million shares outstanding, I get a share price of $21.77.Finally, if I take the current IPO price of $20/share as the purchase price, I would expect to earn an internal rate of return of 15% by participating in the IPO.ConclusionWhile the DCF analysis is ""interesting"", it is also a bit of a yawn in terms of the investment opportunity. I don't find it to be a compelling long or short, but rather, I am unexpectedly neutral on it. What will be truly interesting, however, is to watch how the shares trade in the first few days.If the shares trade below of $16 in the near future, I would be a strong buyer, as that would allow me to achieve my target IRR of 25%. If prices reach north of $30, I would consider a short position, as that trade would have an expected return of 30%.In closing, unfortunately GoDaddy is a bit of a yawn on the initial pricing, but there could be some interesting opportunities down the road!"
3049336,67493,2015-04-03T05:49:07-04:00,"The mispricing of securities in the IPO process never ceases to amaze me.GDDY has exhibited decent revenue and bookings growth in recent years, posting mid-teens CAGR growth rates in the 2012-2014 period.GDDY is not a new company; has not generated a GAAP profit once in the last five years.","The mispricing of securities in the IPO process never ceases to amaze me. Despite reams of historical evidence that most IPOs are overpriced and represent poor medium-term investments, there is an almost-unending stream of retail punters who jump into the next 'hot' IPO at almost any price, often on the basis of name recognition alone, only to be sorely disappointed in the months that follow. For the life of me, I can't figure out what it is about new merchandise that so excites the masses, but this element of bull market behavior seems immutable. GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), the well-known domain name and internet hosting service (mostly for its raunchy Superbowl ads), is just the latest in a long line, coming public at $20 this week and closing the first day's trade north of $26, for a cool 30% day one pop. As an example of how fundamentally wrong the market can be (for extended periods), it serves as a pretty fine example.Before digging into the negatives, though, let's acknowledge the positives (yes, unlike some IPOs, there are actually a few). GDDY has exhibited decent revenue and bookings growth in recent years, posting mid-teens CAGR growth rates in each of the 2012-2014 period (somewhat supported by acquisitions, but we'll leave that for now). While profitability on a GAAP basis remains elusive (mostly due to a large interest burden from the company's substantial debt), adjusted EBITDA has grown nicely from $174mm in 2012 to $275mm in 2014 (heavily adjusted, but still - let's leave for now). More important than the numbers, perhaps, is the business and GDDY's place in it: the core domain registry and hosting business (around 90% of group revs in 2014) is low-margin and maturing but still growing low double-digits (in lock step with the ongoing growth in shift to online); GDDY is one of the largest players with ~20-25% market share. Better for GDDY is their focus on small businesses - around 50% of which, in the US, remain offline (according to the company), offering further ample runway for growth. ARPU trends are favorable, growing ~10% a year the last two years, and, at ~$115/year, are still lower than their main competition, Web.com (WWWW), where ARPU is ~$165/year, suggesting scope for further growth there too.Now for the bad. GDDY is not a new company: they have been around, in one form or another, since 1997, and according to the data offered in the prospectus, has not generated a GAAP profit once in the last five years. This is a massive problem for a company in a well-known industry and maturing market that is trying to convince the market to pay a premium multiple. Consider that despite the operational and scale improvements of the last two years, the company is still running solidly loss-making at the operating level; and given how fragmented the market, it is unlikely market share has much room to expand. And while GDDY claims to be a 'cloud-based provider' of value-added services, core domains/hosting still represents ~90% of revenues as of 2014 - which, since these markets are competitive and relatively low-margin, suggests overall market expansion could be difficult to achieve as well.Somewhat ominously, GDDY had previously tried to IPO twice, but PE sponsors pulled the deal both times due to 'market conditions' - not exactly propitious for buyers now. Most all the use of proceeds of the offering (~$315mm out of ~$470mm raised) will go to debt paydown, meaning PE sponsors are not cashing out their stakes at the IPO. Normally, I would take this as a positive sign, but actually in this case it makes me think large PE secondary offerings are simply a matter of time, especially if the stock stays up here (mid-$20s).I guess it all comes down to valuation in the end, and this is where the current price is mind-boggling. Consider, pro-forma for the IPO, the share count will consist of: 23mm class A shares issued in the IPO; 38.8mm other Class A shares already existing; 90.4mm class B shares (held by sponsors and exchangeable to Class A post-IPO); and up to 35mm more shares to be issued under existing incentive plans/stock options agreements (at least 27mm of which have strike prices in the $7-8.5 range). Let's say pro-forma fully-diluted share count is 179.2mm shares (including just the stock with low-priced options from the above), suggesting a pro-forma market cap (at $26/share) of $4.66bn. (It's important to note that only ~12.8% of the total share count is in the float (23mm/179.2mm), which - like many recent IPOs - provides a technical bid to the shares in the near-term but will likely pressure prices substantially once the majority of the float enters the market). Given the company also has ~$900mm of pro-forma net debt (even after the paydown post IPO), GDDY is sporting a cool ~$5.55bn EV - or 4x 2014 sales, and 20x FY14 'adjusted' EBITDA.20x EV/EBITDA - even assuming the EBITDA number is real, which it is not (heavily adjusted by deferred revenue changes and stock comp) - is expensive in a vacuum; but when you look at comps it really makes you wonder. Web.com is the best comp: it is smaller (~3.5mm customers vs. 13mm for GDDY) but occupies the exact same niche (small business focused) in the exact same industry (domain name registry, hosting, and value-add web design services, etc.). Sure, it is growing slightly slower (7-10% revs + bookings) and has perhaps less scale, but trades at just 10x EV/EBITDA and 2.5x EV/sales. Much larger, more diversified VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) - which, by the way, has been consistently GAAP profitable and throws off a ton of cash - trades at 11x EV/EBITDA (admittedly the business model for VeriSign is a bit different).If GDDY was an early-stage growth company with an undefined 'blue sky' growth opportunity, these kinds of multiples and day-one enthusiasm would at least be explainable. But in response to the listing of a two-decades old business with a history of operating losses, a mostly mature (or at least maturing) market, a large majority of the share count yet to enter the float, the specter of numerous secondary offerings from motivated PE sellers; and, of course, listed comps trading at a fraction of the valuation, GDDY at $26 is beyond expensive. Look out below!Disclosure: No position in GDDY (but may look to short once borrow becomes available)"

The company plans to offer 22 million shares in the range of $17-$19 per share. At the midpoint, the market cap would be roughly $2.7 billion fully diluted - roughly 2x current annual sales. This is not GoDaddy's fist go at an IPO. In 2006, the company withdrew attempts citing a weak market for IPOs. In 2011, KKR, Silver Lake and TCV made a major investment for ownership, keeping the company privately-held. The most recent IPO attempt is being spurred by both private equity backers looking to exit and the need to pay a $300 million debt obligation. However, the result may not be all bad for IPO investors.ExitingThe IPO is clearly an opportunity for the private equity owners to exit and take a payday while IPO appetites and market valuations are high. The current IPO is structured to create limited dilution for existing owners. The result will be a large payday.Source: GoDaddy S-1Individual investors should always be worried about IPOs that are clearly exit opportunities for existing owners. Existing owners understand more about the company than the IPO investors, and they also have an incentive to price the IPO as high as possible for themselves, with no consideration to appropriate valuations.DebtThe other reason for the IPO is to raise capital for an existing debt obligation in tune of more than $300 million. Since the IPO is likely to raise somewhere around $400 million after fees, the vast majority of proceeds are earmarked toward paying this obligation.Source: GoDaddy S-1GoDaddy is using the IPO to reduce unsustainable leverage levels. The IPO capital is a much-needed source of capital as the company will be unable to service their debt with annual cash flows. Currently, their annual cash flow is about one-tenth the total amount of debt due within the next five years.Income ProblemsDespite strong sales growth, GoDaddy has been unable to post a positive net income figure. After backing out non-cash depreciation expense, the company was about breakeven in 2014.Source: GoDaddy S-1The main issue is the fact that even on private equity management, GoDaddy was unable to turn a profit. The investments in technology and marketing to stay competitive seem to outpace and outweigh the achievable sales growth.The OpportunityDespite all of the signs that scream ""avoid this IPO,"" there is one sign that still looks extremely promising - growth. If you would have invested in the GoDaddy IPO of 2006, you could have seen steady growth of roughly 30% annually over the past nine years. The company posted just over $130 million in revenues in 2005. The result - a 10-fold increase in revenues from 2005 plus an improving net income. Also, without $300 million in debt and the interest payments, the company would be much closer to profitability in 2014. The result would have been an investment that with all likelihood would have increased nearly 1,000% in nine years.Source: GoDaddy S-1Even as growth has slowed in the past five years the company has posted steady and strong growth. With expanded focus on international markets, the company likely will be able to post these growth trends at least for the next few years.SummaryThere are many signs that would seem to signal that individual investors should avoid this IPO. The signals include private-equity backers that are capitalizing on an excellent time to exit a company, and most of the proceeds are going toward paying off debt. Nevertheless, GoDaddy has posted incredible growth for a small business over the past 10 years. Even if this growth slows slightly, the move toward international opportunities should enable strong growth in the near future. Investors should let the dust settle after the IPO. There are many signals that will likely deflate the price of the stock following the initial issue. Once the stock shows some signs of stabilization, investors should consider picking up a high-growth technology stock."

3214526,69675,2015-05-28T09:31:51-04:00,"Since its IPO, shares of GoDaddy have soared, likely leaving some investors thinking about what to do with the company's stock.Given the company's performance and the business it operates in, it's likely growth will continue but investors need to be cognizant of the company's bottom line.Add to this the fact that shares of the enterprise appear fairly expensive and it's clear that GoDaddy is not for the committed value investor right now.","With shares of GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) trading near their 52-week high, some investors may be thinking it's time to get out while the getting's good, while others may be considering whether or not it's appropriate to buy an even larger slice of the pie. The latter train of thought may be particularly appealing since shares already soared 30% on the day of their IPO, which indicates that Mr. Market is incredibly bullish on the business, but is it more likely that it's the more conservative investor who's got the right mode of thought right now?GoDaddy has had mixed resultsOver the past three years, GoDaddy has been quite a growth machine. Between 2012 and 2014, the company saw its revenue jump 52.3% from $910.90 million to $1.39 billion. Most of this can be chalked up to a 24.2% increase in customer count, which rose from 10.24 million to 12.71 million, but investors should also attribute some of the improvement to the company's average revenue per user (its ARPU), which increased by 22.6% from $93 to $114. What this means is that, in addition to adding a larger customer base, the company has been doing so while generating higher sales from each additional customer. When a business is able to accomplish both of these tasks simultaneously, it demonstrates some degree of supplier power.While sales growth has been quite impressive, the same cannot be said of earnings. In 2014 alone, GoDaddy reported a loss of $143.31 million. Although this represents an improvement over the $279.27 million loss the company reported two years earlier, the fact that a business could be valued at $4.12 billion on the market while generating meaningful net losses is scary to say the least.From a profit perspective, GoDaddy is clearly a wash, but what about when you look at the company's cash flows? Last year, the business reported cash flows from operating activities totaling $180.57 million, up 70.2% from the $106.11 million management reported for the company's 2012 fiscal year. This disparity between operating cash flows and net income is due to a lot of factors, but the two largest are depreciation/amortization and deferred revenue.At first glance, investors may not think much of this and may simply find it satisfactory enough that the company is cash flow positive. However, when you consider that depreciation and amortization are expenses that will, one day, be realized in cash when it comes time for the replacement of the relevant assets, and when you consider that deferred revenue is merely cash that the company is borrowing from its future self, it's important to question whether it may be more sensible to evaluate the company from a net income/loss basis instead of from a cash flow one.Shares look expensive either wayFor those who don't mind throwing caution to the wind and basing their investment decision on operating cash flow, there's still the fact that shares of GoDaddy look to be pretty expensive. Using 2014's metrics, shares of the domain name and online servicer are trading at 22.7 times cash flows from operating activities. This isn't necessarily outrageous when you consider that sales have been increasing at a nice clip and the company's bottom line is showing year-over-year improvements, but it's also far from being in the bargain bin of the investment universe.One way to rationalize its share price is to look at the potential for expansion in the years to come. Currently, there are about 3.13 billion internet users across the globe, 279.83 million of whom are located with the U.S. Now, not all of these users will have a use for GoDaddy's services since the majority of internet users don't have their own websites, but if the company can gain the same kind of exposure internationally (it only generated about 24.9% of sales outside of the U.S. in 2014) as it has in the U.S., and if the proportion of U.S. users with domain names is the same abroad, then the business has a prospective market of 94.06 million users that are still up for grabs.TakeawayAt this point in time, I believe that GoDaddy has a great deal of potential from a growth standpoint, but I worry about the company's profitability. Yes, cash flows from operating activities are positive, but due to the nature of those cash flows, there's no guarantee that that will continue. Even if this can happen, however, shares of the online servicer are fairly expensive and may not make for an attractive prospect for hardcore value investors but may, instead, be a more appropriate candidate for growth-oriented investors who care more about market exposure than profitability."

Total bookings from domains grew an average of 11% annually from 2010 to 2014.Hosting and PresenceGDDY generated 39% of 2014 total bookings from the sale of hosting and presence products, primarily from a variety of web-hosting offerings, website builder products, SSL certificates and online commerce products.These products generally have higher margins than domains. Total bookings from hosting and presence products grew an average of 19% annually from 2010 to 2014.Business ApplicationsGDDY generated 10% of 2014 total bookings from the sale of business applications products, primarily from productivity tools such as domain-specific email accounts, which also have higher margins than domains. Total bookings from business applications grew an average of 29% annually from 2010 to 2014.Intellectual propertyAs of December 31, 2014, GDDY had 144 issued patents in the United States, covering various aspects of its product offerings.

2475265,23690,2014-09-05T22:29:51-04:00,An early read of the partial S-1 suggests a market cap of $2.8B to $4B post IPO.Ownership by private equity firms complicates the structure and story a bit – could impact valuation.Company strategy to increase ARPU using value-added services has had limited success so far.Investors should expect an active M&A program post-IPO.,"PositioningGoDaddy (DADDY) is one of the dominant providers of internet domain services for consumers and small businesses. They are famous thanks to their splashy TV commercials, and have built a $1.4B business on the foundation of registering domain names and offering some basic website tools and services. Demand for these core services continues to expand with the internet, and GoDaddy has introduced additional products to support e-commerce and social media with an eye to increasing ARPU.This isn't a nice clean IPO. In 2011, GoDaddy did a financing with private equity firms (KKR, Silver Lake and TCV) which drastically concentrated ownership of the company. GoDaddy is leveraged with $1.5B in debt.Investors will easily appreciate the current position of GoDaddy in the market today for core internet services, but will be looking for more clues as to how the company will grow their value-added service business. Our bet is that M&A will be ramped up sharply post-IPO.Not including the debt, we'd expect the company to trade at $2.8B to $4.0B in terms of market capitalization. We'll have more to say on it once the road show is available.Market and CompetitionGoDaddy competes in three major markets - domains, hosting and applications. 2013 revenues for these three were $672M, $381M and $79M, respectively. Domains and basic hosting continue to dominate the business today.The GoDaddy brand has enabled the company to remain the go-to company for registering domains even though superior options exist. This has enabled the company to excel in what is a fairly commoditized market. The same is mostly true for basic web hosting.The domain market is highly fragmented and very confusing for most consumers and small businesses. This gives GoDaddy a sustainable, moderate growth core business with solid margins. We see United Internet as one of the best direct competitors. This isn't a market in which we expect to see a high degree of rivalry because there is not a lot of juice in it.Hosting is a much more competitive market, especially in terms of price. This is thanks in no small part to the massive investments and innovation brought to the market by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Hosting also is a highly fragmented market. However, software and service providers have been more aggressive here. WordPress (owned by Automattic) has carved out a major position in the free segment with others, including recently-public Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), providing very easy-to-use paid services. Some more tech-savvy users can use companies like Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) or any one of a myriad of smaller services.The value-added or ""business application"" segment of the cloud market is much more open and less commoditized. Even without doing the math, this is where GoDaddy is likely to get the highest returns on new investments if they can achieve scale. So far, the progress has been very limited. For most SMB owners, things like email marketing, social media, payments and promotions are all fairly central to the business. These are all places we should expect to see GoDaddy expand, probably via acquisition, post-IPO.Strategy and ManagementA big part of what GoDaddy provides is a 3,100-strong customer care operation. (Detractors might say that a large number of these are needed simply because the GoDaddy platform is so hard to use.) The strategy depends on adding new customers to the existing base and selling additional services as part of the ""support"" process.Management of GoDaddy is now heavily ""professional"" and driven by the private equity firms which will continue to control the company. The CFO/COO, Scott Wagner, is a KKR guy. The CEO, Blake Irving, was brought in at the beginning of 2013 and has a range of experience, but largely as a high-level custodian at organizations like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (YHOO). Other executives are from organizations like AT&T (NYSE:T), NTT, Microsoft and Yahoo. Bob Parsons, the colorful founder and prior CEO, remains on the board of directors.Management base compensation is reasonable for a $1B+ revenues company and is indexed to performance of ""Cash EBITDA"" and ""New Customers."" What's not clear at all is how those figures would be adjusted or counted if new products are acquired via acquisition.Interesting FootnotesThe organizational structure of this offering with KKR, Silver Lake, TCV, and Bob Parsons is by far the most important aspect to consider. A good portion of the S1 deals with this, and should be weighed carefully as part of the investment case. Since we don't yet have valuation information, it's too early to have a position here.Generally speaking, all the controlling entities of GoDaddy have been keen to take money out of the company, not in a bad way so far, but in the form of interest and distributions. They have put incentives in place for existing management, which are also self-serving. It remains to be seen how external equity investors will be treated.For example, the private equity group is getting $2M per year plus expenses for ""transaction and monitoring fees"" which will terminate with the IPO. However, a final $25M payment due under this agreement will be made as part of the ""use of proceeds."" Ouch.Potentially more troubling is the selection of First Data Merchant Services for reselling as a commerce and payment platform. KKR owns 40% of First Data Corporation. Selections like this are done favoring PE portfolios and will undermine the ability for GoDaddy to provide competitive solutions in a rapidly evolving and very innovative market.Open QuestionsIf domain and hosting services got further commoditized by companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) GOOGL), Amazon and Microsoft, how will GoDaddy grow their still-small value-added services business to prevent growth from going away?What is the exit strategy of the PE groups which will still own the majority of the company? How can that plan be implemented and still provide attractive returns to common equity shareholders who come in with the IPO?Why have new value-added services not grown more over the past few years? It's not like email marketing and services like Shopify are radically new.What criteria will be applied making acquisitions?ConclusionSince we don't yet have the basics on filing range and shares outstanding, it's impossible to have a feel for valuation versus prospects on this one.However, there are certainly some yellow flags given the structure and interested parties that will remain part of GoDaddy as a public company post-IPO. As a reference point, we see the average of 3.4x sales to be the top-end of a likely 2-3x sales trading range.Investors should consider the $1.4B in debt when considering TEV, but they may not. If they ignore it, the company could trade at a $2.8B to $4B market capitalization."
3014326,61281,2015-03-19T14:16:52-04:00,Web services provider GoDaddy files for IPO for the third time since it was founded.The PE-controlled company offers a complex Up-C structure for its offering and directs most of the proceeds to its principal shareholders.Current growth in the company’s margins seems too little and too late.GoDaddy is an IPO to avoid.,"Web services provider GoDaddy (Pending:GDDY) filed its S1 with the SEC at the end of February. The company that was founded 18 years ago, in 1997, quickly became the leading go-to company for domain name registration. For many, GoDaddy is associated with controversial Superbowl ads, Danica Patrick's sponsorship, and scandalous former CEO Bob Parsons. However, GoDaddy also is an Internet veteran that's controlled by private equity funds that want to increase the return on their investment. The current move to go public is part of this effort and, in my opinion, will mainly benefit these funds.The company had previously abandoned its IPO plans in 2006 and 2014, not only due to lack of interest and low demand, but also due to its former CEO's refusal to accept the SEC quiet period terms and follow other SEC restrictions associated with the IPO. A company that withdraws an IPO for dubious reasons and then files again, claiming it has changed, is not an investment I would like to make with my hard-earned money. Besides of the gut feeling I have that drives me away from this IPO, there are other alarming issues in the company's prospectus that make the GoDaddy IPO an unattractive investment, such as disappointing financials, a sophisticated IPO structure, and problematic use of proceeds.Financials and InnovationGoDaddy is an 18-year-old mature company that may make noise and attract negative attention, but it operates in a conservative way with very little innovation and risks. The company generates revenue in three segments: domain, hosting and business applications. The domains segment is the core business of GoDaddy, in which the corporation generates revenues from registering new domain names with ICANN, the organization responsible for domain registration on the Internet. This segment accounts for 55% of the company's revenues and grows at a quarterly rate of 3%. The hosting segment is GoDaddy's second largest segment and accounts for 37% of the company's total revenues. In this segment, GoDaddy generates revenues by offering hosting and website building services to its domain customers. The third and smallest segment is the business applications segment that accounts for 8% of the total revenues and grows to 11% per quarter. In this segment, GoDaddy generates revenue by offering additional services to its existing customers, such as email services, productivity applications and online data storage services. As shown in chart 1 below, all three segments increase steadily from Q1'12.GoDaddy improves not only its top line but also its margins and bottom line. As shown in chart 2 below, the company grows its gross, operating and net margins while keeping its EBITDA margin relatively unchanged.At first glance, it looks great. The company lowers its operating loss margin and net loss margin while increasing its gross margin and maintaining a stable EBITDA margin. However, for an 18-year-old company that's a market leader in its niche, it is too late and not enough. Moreover, when comparing GoDaddy to another Internet veteran with marginal profitability like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), it highlights the unattractiveness of GoDaddy even more. The e-commerce giant understood the necessity to expand to another market outside of its comfort zone as well as to strengthen its core business. Amazon had successful initiatives like AWS and Kindle, less successful initiatives like the Fire Phone, and some ambitious projects that are yet to be decided, like the drones project. However, regardless of whether or not you believe Amazon chose the right initiative and whether it could deliver quality hardware products, the company is constantly looking to innovate and expand its business to other sectors. In GoDaddy's case, the company is focused on a small, highly competitive market of Internet services and does not present any innovation or innovative thinking to grow its business. It seems to me that GoDaddy is comfortable with its leadership position in the Web services market, and it tries to improve it with many small, low-key initiatives. As the profitability is marginal, I would have expected to see great growth plans for the future that would compensate for the inadequate financials, but GoDaddy does not have any.IPO Structure and ProceedsIn 2011, three private equity funds - KKR, Silver Lake and TCV - acquired 68% of GoDaddy for an estimated amount of $2.5B. These funds are now offering GoDaddy's stock to the public in an Up-C structure in which investors will be offered stock to a new company after it has bought the assets of the old company. The complicated structure may seem irrelevant for some of the investors, but it will provide tax benefits for the funds mentioned above and will lower GoDaddy's tax liability as it creates an intangible asset on the balance sheet of the new company. Facilitating this structure and executing it involves higher IPO costs that will be reduced by the expected proceeds.The rest of the proceeds will be used to pay the holding funds and repay a senior note, and only $25M will be employed by the company for operational needs, as shown in the excerpt below from the company's S1.When most of the IPO proceeds flow out of the company immediately after the IPO and only $25M is planned to be used for operational needs, it seems that the only ones to benefit from GoDaddy's IPO are the holding private equity funds and Bob Parsons, who still holds 28% of the company's shares.ConclusionWeb services provider GoDaddy has filed for an IPO for the third time since its inception. In the current attempt, the company unveils disappointing financials that don't reflect an 18-year-old company. The complex IPO structure and use of proceeds highlight my concern that the main beneficiaries of this IPO are the principal stockholders: KKR, Silver Lake, TCV and Bob Parsons. On top of that, the company does not seek other revenue streams outside of its core business of Internet services and does not offer any impressive growth ahead. I usually cover growth tech companies and discuss their growth potential and how investors can benefit. In GoDaddy's case, I do not see it."

With over 4900 employees and 59 million registered domains, it has set terms to raise $396 million through an initial public offering. The company will debut on the NYSE on April 1st under symbol GDDY. Originally set for 2006 with Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch as the book-runners and the anticipated ticker ""DADY"", Go Daddy withdrew its application for IPO 3 months later due to the claimed ""weak demand for IPOs"" at the time; however, 84 other tech companies managed to go public that year. In a Seeking Alpha article by Lior Ronen, the 2006 withdrawal was also due to its former CEO's refusal to accept the SEC quiet period terms and follow other SEC restrictions associated with the IPO. Five years later, after Bob Parsons stepped down as CEO, private equity firms KKR, TCV and Silver Lake Partners acquired the company for $2.25 billion - Parsons still owns a 28.1% stake and [post-IPO] will own 40% of class B shares and 24% of class A shares.Current Stakeholders (March 31, 2014 Estimates):Directors and Executive Officers - 29%KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P) - 28%Silver Lake Partners - 28%TCV (Technology Crossover Ventures) - 12.6%Other affiliated entities - 2.4%If you have the time to read the prospectus you will see some favorable terms for existing stakeholders. For example:-Bob Parsons will receive a $3 million services-agreement termination fee, as per the Wall Street Journal.-Private Equity firms, although they will their stakes in GoDaddy, will receive a $26 million to terminate their management agreement with the company. Which is interesting because GoDaddy already pays KKR, Silver Lake and TCV management fees of $2.2 million a year.NOTE: this is after their portion of the $350 million distribution back in May 2014.· On May 13, 2014 GoDaddy financed and increased their term-loan balance to $1.1 billion to make this distribution to unit holders and certain holders of unit options [executives and PE firms].-Existing owners (pre-IPO) will receive 85% of certain tax savings available under the ""Up-C"" structure adopted to undertake the IPO.

Of total sales, 23% was attributed to customers outside of the United States.Net losses attributable to GoDaddy Inc. on a GAAP basis are $324 million, $279 million and $200 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Over the last 5 years (2009 through 2013), the company has invested [to support their growth] $763 million in technology/development expenses and $543 million in marketing/advertisement expenses. Throughout the same period, however, they have experienced consistent revenue growth. GoDaddy even warns that any additional debt or equity financing [which they anticipate will need] may not be obtainable on acceptable terms due to their significant debt -- currently worth $1.4 billion.The web hosting market is a low margin business, GoDaddy is not the only company that has posted operating losses - Web.com and Endurance International Group has posted years of losses. GoDaddy still thinks that their outdated strategy of flashy ads to generate domain registrations will take them out of the red. For example, their localized and targeted domain naming strategy of adding "".guru"" or "".nyc"" (among others) is targeting the businesses and individuals who are having difficulty finding new domain names or cannot afford the premium prices for the 270 million registered .com's, .org's, and .biz domains. What GoDaddy does not realize is that business is transforming into mobile and social media, where websites are an ancillary tool and not a core necessity. In today's market, for the bulk of GoDaddy's market (small local businesses), a well-built Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) flash page will drive more sales and attention than any website. Additionally, the competition is ramping up their efforts to take away market share. The smaller competitors like 1and1, Squarespace, BlueHost, and iPage, are providing great service packages and deals to generate domain transfers from under GoDaddy's management. Meanwhile, bigger name competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are leveraging their cloud computing services and merchant solutions to capture the business that comes AFTER a domain registration. Google is even selling domain names directly now.From a service and pricing standpoint, here are some examples of Web Hosting Reviews:Web Hosting Free Reviews: GoDaddy not ranked in top 10 (iPage ranked #1)TopHostScout: GoDaddy Not ranked in top 10 (inmotion hosting ranked #1)Consumer-Rankings: GoDaddy ranked #8 (iPage ranked #1)Top10Best: GoDaddy ranked #5 (web.com ranked #1)There is one great thing about GoDaddy: Their brand equity and recognition in the market is arguably one of the highest in the technology industry. But the incredibly complex legal structure is orchestrated to benefit the current shareholders and not the new buyers. The first tech IPO in 2015 was Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX), a cloud storage/SaaS company, and it has not performed very well due to billing slowdown and an unbelievable statistic: 96% of revenues spent on sales and marketing. Box has dropped in value by 32% since its IPO debut. We anticipate GoDaddy will yield similar performance figures post-IPO before the end of 2015."

The payout, far from unusual in the private equity world, pushed GoDaddy debt up to $1.5 billion on May 31, just days before the IPO filing.The substantial borrowings add to the difficulties facing GoDaddy. It reported a net loss of $51.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, roughly equal to last year's quarterly loss. That followed a 2013 full-year loss of $199.9 million and a 2012 loss of $279.1 million.Loss making, of course, has become admired by some investors who're focused on rapid growth, and that sentiment has pushed up shares of some tech shares, notably sotware-as-a-service stocks like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), NetSuite (NYSE:N), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK).WDAY Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsBut GoDaddy, still relatively small with annual sales cresting above $1 billion for the first time in 2013, posted first-quarter revenue growth of a mere 22%, to $320.2 million. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which had 2013 revenue of $55.6 billion, is still growing nearly that fast; its first-quarter revenue was up 19%. Terms of the GoDaddy offering aren't set yet and market conditions in coming weeks will have a lot to say about how much the company can raise in the offering, and whether the IPO can establish a deep and liquid market in GoDaddy shares that would allow the investor groups and Parsons, should he want to, to make an exit. Or, as GoDaddy's ads say, ""It's Go Time.""KKR and Silver Lake led the $2.33 billion buyout of GoDaddy in late 2011; GoDaddy had filed for an IPO in 2006 and then called it off. The 2011 deal had the buyout firms putting up $881.7 million of actual cash, more than one third of the purchase price. A KKR official told Reuters at the time that a bigger cash contribution than normal was involved because GoDaddy was a ""growth investment.""Parsons founded the company in 1997 and it became the largest marketer of domain names, with 57 million addresses under management, or 21% of domains worldwide. Once someone buys a domain name, they tend to renew, so 85% or so of GoDaddy revenue comes from customers who were also with the company the year before. That's the kind of annuity-like business model investors like to see.GoDaddy was last profitable on a full-year basis in 2009, with net income of $14.6 million on revenue of $610.3 million. A modest loss in 2010 was followed by big losses in the following three years.Growing, it turns out, is expensive, with big technology investments, marketing and sales costs and, under the buyout's accounting set-up, big amortization and depreciation expense.In its IPO filing, GoDaddy makes clear it prefers different metrics. It likes bookings, which are all the cash receipts taken in during a given period, better than revenue. It only records revenue as the domain name and other customer agreements progress, so a two-year domain name rental paid up results in revenue spread out over 24 months. Bookings for 2013 were $1.40 billion, versus revenue of $1.13 billion. Some sales don't stick, however, and GoDaddy is forced to make refunds: $96.1 million of refunds in 2013.GoDaddy also likes adjusted EBITDA, which omits those pesky depreciation and amortization expenses. And it's also enamored by a metric known as unlevered free cash flow, which is akin to a consumer making a monthly budget that omits the mortgage payment. It's fun to dream.Costs as a percentage of revenue are generally coming down, which is good news. But the domain name and web site hosting business has become very competitive. And, GoDaddy warns in the IPO's risks section: ""As a result of out increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve future profitability.""Disclosure: No positions"

The company, which maintains headquarters in Scottsdale, Ariz., offers website hosting services and domain name registration to over 12 million customers worldwide.IPO Details Still TBDFamous for its controversial and sassy commercials, GoDaddy has chosen Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase to lead the IPO, which could take place late this year or early next. GoDaddy has not yet announced how much equity the IPO will raise or how much privately held stock will be included in the sale.Currently, major shareholders include investment firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake. These two private investment houses paired up with Technology Crossover Ventures to buy GoDaddy for $2.25 billion almost two years ago.GoDaddy Goes BigAfter the leveraged buyout, GoDaddy tempered its raucous image in edgy advertisements that included models in skimpy outfits. One Super Bowl commercial had a woman use a puppet to tell her boss she was quitting. Another ad had bodybuilders racing in the streets and taking over a spray-tanning salon.(Source: money.cnn.com, courtesy of Go Daddy).In addition, the firm brought in Blake Irving, previously a Yahoo executive, as the chief executive two years ago; as a result, GoDaddy has worked on expanding its market share with businesses.The Next In A High-Profile SeriesAn IPO for the company would represent the latest in a group of sales with stock indexes coming close to record highs and investors seeking ownership in newly listed firms.Within the first two months of this year, more IPOs came to market than any time since 2007. Several high-profile IPOs are set to sell or have sold recently, including King Digital Entertainment PLC (BATS:KING), which makes Candy Crush Saga, and Moelis Co.Endurance International Group Holdings (NASDAQ:EIGI), a direct competitor of GoDaddy in the web hosting market, IPO-ed last October, and its shares have seen an 18% increase since then.Expected Revenue GrowthGoDaddy expects revenue to grow in the high-single-digit percentages this year, according to a report in January by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. S&P indicated that it predicts that cash profits will grow by a slightly lower rate, due to increasing costs as GoDaddy invests in its growth.GoDaddy has added a lineup of new products and has focused on expansion overseas. At the same time, the company has opened a new technology center and offices in the U.S. Currently, GoDaddy manages more than 56 million domain names.What Investors Should Watch ForGiven these potential positive catalysts for GoDaddy, along with its continued high-profile, flashy advertisements, it is likely that GoDaddy could warrant significant attention come-IPO.Like KING, however, GoDaddy's flair could backfire. KING had a first day return of approximately -15% and is currently trading below its IPO price.As with any high-profile IPO, investors should pay close attention to the company's fundamentals. If GoDaddy continues posting strong revenues and keeps growth on track, investors should consider buying in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

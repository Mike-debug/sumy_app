As you can see above, its underlying issues were already affecting the company in 2019, way before COVID.Saying that, H1 2020 has been particularly challenging for Groupon, with its revenues falling by roughly 31% y/y.This has been amply reflected already in valuation (more on this later), but it's important to keep this trajectory in mind, as we consider its bottom-line prospects.Putting aside some volatility in its share price, for all intents and purposes, Groupon is already very close to an all-time low price. Yes, looking in hindsight, the argument can be made that Groupon's shares have bounced back from the lows set earlier in the year, but in the grand scheme of things, Groupon trades at close to an all-time low, with shareholder sentiment most likely also very negative.In other words, investors' expectations here are so low that any shareholder who would have wanted to throw in the towel already has.Groupon believes that it can strip back costs from its operations, so that even with only 80% of pre-COVID revenues, it could reach adjusted EBITDA levels comparable to 2019. Back in 2019, Groupon had $227 million of adjusted EBITDA.More specifically, the carrot for investors is roughly $250 million of EBITDA by 2022.Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationGroupon asserts that its prospects lie in getting more customers to use Groupon more frequently. To achieve this, Groupon believes its strategy needs to revolve around having higher quality inventory that interests consumers to return to its platform.Before discussing its valuation, bear in mind that Groupon's balance sheet is not as nimble as desirable.To illustrate, investors should remember that Groupon has $200 million outstanding under its revolver, plus roughly $20 million under letters of credit outstanding. Also, Groupon has approximately $420 million of borrowings on its balance sheet.These sums totaled up imply Groupon's claims are close to $650 million. Of course, this is easily offset with the $780 million of cash on its balance sheet.Leaving Groupon with more than $130 million of cash and equivalents. Given that its market cap reaches $730 million, this means that more than 17% of its market cap is made up of cash.To a certain extent, this would put some sort of downside protection to equity investors. Having said that, I know from experience of investing in the deep value companies that investors are much more concerned about the business' ongoing prospects, rather than having sufficient cash on the balance sheet. Because, in reality, cash on the balance sheet is only worth something if management is able to do something with it.As a reminder, Groupon's CEO Aaron Cooper has only been in the job a few months and has little skin in the game in terms of Groupon's shares.Moving on, for H1 2020, Groupon's cash flows from operations were negative $149 million - during the unprecedented pandemic.Thus, given that Q2 2020 generated more than $87 million in cash flows, this is a very strong performance. To offer some context, let's not forget that Groupon's main verticals are events and activities, beauty, wellness, travel, and dining - those sectors were most damaged by COVID.Also, during the same period a year ago, Groupon's cash flows were negative $50 million.However, despite the strong cash flows made during Q2 2020, management still guides that Groupon will finish 2020 with negative operating cash flows.Groupon's Q1 2020 EBITDA was negative $10 million, while Q2 2020 EBITDA was positive $1 million. Management guides investors that if August and September are in line with July, Groupon may see its adjusted EBITDA come close to $10 million.On the one hand, $10 million of EBITDA in Q3 2020 - management's top end guidance - is a marked decline from $50 million of EBITDA Groupon reported during the same period a year ago.On the other hand, last year, the economy was strong and vibrant, thus being able to report any positive adjusted EBITDA would be a very strong result for the company.Groupon is in a difficult situation where its operations are in the middle of the most affected sectors. However, nobody can reasonably make the argument that investors are pricing in any sort of growth story, given that the stock trades for approximately 3x its 2022 EBITDA.Investors have long ago forgotten about this company, and in the event that it turns around its fortunes, it could be a rewarding investment opportunity."

The closure of the company’s goods business shows that Groupon is committed to pivot to another business model, which has a greater potential to reward its shareholders in the long term. The better than expected performance in Q2 shows that Groupon, after years of losing value, still has a chance to execute a turnover and return to profitability. For that reason, I decided to open a long position in the company.The closure of Groupon's goods business this year shows that the company's management is able to quickly shut down poor-performing projects and look for other opportunities that have a greater potential to create value. While the goods business accounted for a large chunk of Groupon's revenues, its gross profit margins were at low double-digit levels, so it made sense to shut that business down and focus on high margin opportunities. With 38 million active users on its platform, it makes sense for Groupon to pivot the local experiences market and expand its marketplace of bookable activities. By offering various deals to its users, Groupon should be viewed as a great lead generation tool for small and middle businesses to quickly acquire new customers and improve their conversion metrics.The latest earnings results for Q2 surprised the company's investors and proved its doubters that Groupon is not a dead brand yet. While Groupon's revenues from April to June declined by 25.7% Y/Y to $395.65 million, they were better than the street estimates by $212.38 million, and the company managed to generate $70 million in FCF. In addition, the company's GAAP EPS was -$2.53, which is also better than the street estimates of -$3.97, while its net loss of $72 million was better than the forecasted loss of $113 million.At this stage, becoming a marketplace for local experiences makes sense. In 2019 alone Groupon had $3.4 billion in billings from local experiences such as sports, concerts, restaurants, bars, etc. In addition, the services business, unlike goods, has always been a high margins business, which has the potential to return the company to profitability. Considering that Groupon has more than 200 million downloads of its mobile app, while its site, which has more than 1 million merchants, is one of the most visited eCommerce sites in the US, it would be easier for the company to leverage its assets and pivot to the new business model with relative ease. The good thing is that it's unlikely that we'll see another round of lockdowns in the US, which is the company's biggest market, so it's safe to say that now is the good time for Groupon to reorganize itself. The only thing that Groupon now needs to focus on is to build a substantial inventory of experiences and establish a stronger foothold in various local markets in order to improve its overall margins and attract new customers that will drive the growth of the overall business.The two major risks that I see at this stage are the inability of the current management to execute a turnover, and the increased competition from other local experience providers. We should not forget that the current management failed to drive growth when the economy was booming, as Groupon's stock has severely underperformed against the S&P 500 in recent years. In addition, as companies like TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Airbnb (AIRB) also begin to leverage their platforms to establish a better presence in the local experiences market, there's a risk that customers might abandon Groupon and opt for other platforms. With that in mind, I believe that executing this transition to local experiences is a key at this stage, and there's a risk that the management might fail to deliver the necessary results that could lead to growth.Chart: BloombergHowever, while I believe that those risks could hurt the company's performance in the foreseeable future, at the current price the downside of owning Groupon shares is priced in. After all, the company has a solid $785 million cash position and it also plans to cut an additional $200 million in operating expenses in the near term. In addition, the company trades at a price-to-sales ratio of only ~0.3x, which makes me believe that Groupon is undervalued to other tech stocks, which trade at insane premium valuations right now. While pivoting to new endeavors is always a risky thing to do, I think that Groupon's management is capable of improving the overall situation and for that reason, I'm long the company."
4366858,102472,2020-08-09T15:53:13-04:00,"Groupon's share price surged almost 60% on not-so-bad results, recuperating the losses from the past months, but still offers 100% upside.
        Turn around plan is expected to bring results by the end of the year and put GRPN on growth trajectory again. Balance sheet is strong enough to support the plan.
        The management expects $250m-$300m adjusted EBITDA in 2022, which at 6x multiple yields EV of $1.5bn-$1.8bn or $40-$50/share.","Groupon, Inc. (GRPN) surprised the stock market by delivering not-so-bad Q2 results on August 6. Groupon shares surged almost 60% in the falling market on August 7, recuperating its losses from the previous months. We remain bullish on the stock and believe that probability of the successful turnaround plan is underestimated by the market. In our opinion the share price offers at least 100% upside.We were the only author on Seeking Alpha with bullish recommendation on GRPN in the past two months. In our article we described the new strategy and put a target price of $60-$80/share: Groupon Is A Buy For A Patient Investor. Groupon shares took a beating after the reverse share split in June, with market apparently expecting a deterioration in company's performance.In fact, EPS consensus estimates for Q2 were at -$3.97 ($113m net loss), while Groupon delivered -$2.53 in results for Q2 2020 yesterday ($72m net loss), beating the market by $1.44. In our view, one reason behind such disparity in estimated vs. actual results could be the assumptions regarding the write-downs and restructuring costs. In Q1 2020 Groupon's new management orchestrated an earnings bloodbath, by writing down $135m in goodwill and long-lived assets impairments. Without those charges, Groupon would have posted a net loss of $76m in Q1. In Q2, however, Groupon incurred only $40.5m in restructuring costs and therefore posted ""only"" $74m in net loss.As for the earnings estimates going forward, the analysts expect Q3 EPS to be in line with Q2 results: -$2.35/share (net loss of $66m). After that a minimal quarterly loss of $4m-$30m is expected. Source: Seeking Alpha, Author's commentsAs we discussed in the previous article: Why The Stock Is So Volatile, 40% movements in one day are not new for GRPN stock. We expect this to continue as the share price is easily moved by strong trading volume. We see GRPN not as a speculative stock, but rather as a long-term investment and a faith in company's turnaround.Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/VB8GVFMl/The chart below shows Groupon's revenues, gross profit and operating expenses over the past 5 quarters. As you can see, back in 2019 the company barely generated enough gross profit to cover the operating expenses. The reasons behind it were 1) declining revenues due to severe competition in goods 2) extremely low (15%) gross profit margin on goods segment, which accounted for 52% of sales in 2019. In contrast to goods profit margin, Groupon earns a staggering 85% gross profit margin for services. The third reason was 3) high operating expenses, which could not be supported by the declining revenues and gross profit.Source: Company's dataTo overcome the negative points above, Groupon's management announced on FY 2019 earnings call that the company would exit Goods segment by the end of 2020 and conduct a restructuring program to cut its operating expenses by $200m in 2021.Groupon's management is currently executing a strategy of exiting the goods category and expanding Groupon's inventory in the services segment such as things to do, beauty and wellness and dining offerings.Groupon estimates the North America market at 80 experiences pro consumer p.a. The management currently directs its attention to capture that market by offering not only heavily discounted deals, but also local experiences at little to no discount. In addition to that, Groupon plans to eliminate the restrictions on its deals, where the customer could use it only on particular day or could buy the deal only once, thus driving repeat purchases and revenue streams respectively.If successful, this move will attract not only new customers interested in a broader and deeper inventory, but it will also improve the relationship between Groupon and its merchants. In the past, Groupon's strategy was to place only heavily discounted offers on its platform, which was not acceptable to some merchants. Now the company is dedicated to building a lasting and mutually-profitable relationship with its merchants by offering also full-price services on its platform.We view the strategy as positive, because, when successful, it will enable Groupon to return to revenues growth after years of decline. However, the current environment amid COVID-19 crisis poses a significant challenge to Groupon's ability to execute on its plan. According to company's earnings call, Groupon's local units were down nearly 70% in Q2. It's services revenue in Q2 decreased 60% compared to the same quarter last year. People are unlikely to try out new services, such as wellness and spa when they are concerned about their health and the risks associated with COVID-19.Therefore it's crucial that Groupon has a solid balance sheet with $785m in cash as of June 30, 2020 (compared to $667 at the end of Q1). Even better news is that despite the decline in revenues, the company was able to generate $70m in Free Cash Flow in Q2 2020. During the recent earnings call, Groupon's CFO Melissa Thomas gave adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2022:At the same time Melissa pointed out that the current measures could lead to growth beyond pre-COVID levels, which, then respectively could result in even higher EBITDA.However, even using a conservative assumption of $250m-$300m adjusted EBITDA in 2022, the valuation at 6x EV/EBITDA multiple would result in a fair price of $40-$50/share. Implying, that even after today's almost 60% surge in share price, GRPN still offers 100% upside potential.In our opinion, Groupon is successfully steering its way through the COVID-19 crisis, delivering better than expected results and outlining clear strategy for growth.Using EV/EBITDA 6x multiple valuation and company's guidance for 2022, results in fair share price estimate of $40-$50/share, offering 100% upside to the current price.To watch: Q3 Reslts in November, especially the following KPIs: active customers, billings and gross profit margin.If you liked the article please ""follow"" to see more articles like this."
4369214,69905,2020-08-17T12:53:10-04:00,Q2 results show that Groupon still has some vitality left in it.Dissecting its free cash flow shows that much of the cash made in the quarter is not likely to be recurring.There is a lot of pessimism priced into its stock. Investors would do well to follow the company from the sidelines.,"Groupon (GRPN) reported strong Q2 2020 results that saw the stock pop more than 50%. Even though the results are certainly attractive, the company is still not out of the woods.Groupon still has a lot to prove to demonstrate to investors that it could be a rewarding investment opportunity. However, on balance, I argue that investors should keep an attentive eye on this company, to see if its plans to grow its EBITDA line gains any traction. For now, the stock is a hold.Source: Author's calculationsGroupon is the typical deep value play where shareholders become accustomed to receiving bad news that anything less than bad news and the stock was primed to re-rate higher.Indeed, the troubles plaguing Groupon had been in place long before COVID, as the graph above highlights.In fact, looking back to Q4 2019, when the economy was at its strongest pre-COVID period, Groupon's revenue growth rates even then were reporting negative 23% revenue growth rates.Also, shareholders are likely to remember that earlier in 2020 both Groupon's CEO and CFO stepped away from the company and that interim CEO Aaron Cooper took the reins with the objective of stabilizing the business.The big headline that drove the stock to pop more than 50% on the back of these results was that the company had stopped burning through cash and actually generated positive $70 million of free cash flow despite the horrible environment it had to operate in.Investors would be quick to speculate that if Groupon was able to stop its cash burn and actually generate some free cash flow during COVID, then there may actually be some underlying potential to the company, right?Digging into its free cash flow one key item surfaces. Noteworthy is that the bulk of its free cash flow was driven by improved working capital movements.In fact, accrued merchant and supplier payables were a source of $80 million of cash during Q2 2020; a sharp reversal from the negative $50 million seen during the same time a year ago.This source of cash infusion is obviously not sustainable and is even likely to reverse in the quarters ahead. However, for now, this affords Groupon with some breathing space.Looking ahead over the coming few quarters and early 2021, Groupon believes that it can report adjusted EBITDA levels comparable with 2019. Looking back to 2019, Groupon reported $227 million of adjusted EBITDA, thus, for a company with a market cap of less than $700 million, this is an alluring amount of EBITDA for shareholders to consider.Groupon drew down a further $50 million on its revolver during Q2 so that its total outstanding under its revolver now reaches $200 million.Moreover, Groupon also has approximately $420 million of borrowings and senior notes combined. However, that is easily offset by its $785 million of cash on its balance sheet.Altogether, Groupon's balance sheet carries at least $150 million of net cash (if we don't include its lease obligations).Looking back over the past several quarters, Groupon has attempted to grow its Local operations. Groupon declares that Local has a total addressable market of $1 trillion and that Groupon is a leader in this space. The assertion is that if Groupon gains any market share here, it would be highly rewarding for shareholders.Groupon's Q2 2020 results argue that the company is down but not out and that there is a strong imperative to stabilize its operations.For now, investors are being asked to pay up less than $700 million market cap for a company with a $150 million net cash position. In other words, Groupon is in no way exuberantly priced. However, Groupon still has a lot of work to do to impress investors that it has what it takes to gain traction in the quarters ahead."

        Groupon has had to resort to its Goods marketplace to sustain cash flow during this time, a business it had planned on exiting.
        Recovery trends in the flagship Local business are weak through May.
        Despite cost-cutting measures, Groupon is currently still bleeding through its cash balances.","Like it or not, the coronavirus will change the way we live for a long time. Businesses that depend on people getting together and organizing events, like Groupon (GRPN), will not only face near-term challenges but face an existential threat to their entire business model. Alongside other events-based internet companies like Eventbrite (EB), Groupon has lost a great deal of market value in the year-to-date, with shares down more than 60% so far:Despite being now what seems like a value offering, Groupon is like a fish flailing on dry land. The key points investors should be aware of:The fundamental question here: will people still use services like Groupon in the post-coronavirus world? I think that they will, but at a far reduced rate. The way Groupon frames its ideal North American customer, summarized in the slide below from its latest earnings deck, is a telling signal:Figure 1. Groupon's target customer Source: Groupon Q1 earnings deckThese days, this target young professional millennial is actually moving out of cities, and though the fact that young people have started socializing again has led to a recent spike in coronavirus cases, they aren't purchasing organized group events through companies like Groupon, which are often held with strangers - instead, people are choosing to socialize in their own small circles, via self-organized events.Groupon, a business that was already losing momentum pre-pandemic (units growth in the Local business was in the single digits), may be nearing its end. Recently, in a bid to shore up enthusiasm for the stock, Groupon's chairman and co-founder Eric Lefkofsky bought an additional ~$5 million worth of shares and increased his stake to ~12% of the company, but investors would be wise to avoid buying the dip in this name. Like many Internet businesses before it, very few companies can manage to retain scale and longevity beyond their period of initial popularity, and I fear that Groupon is looking at the end of the road.Let's start with the obvious: the coronavirus has completely decimated Groupon's business. We got a taste of that in Groupon's first-quarter results, shown in the table below, when poor performance in March brought down the entire quarter:Figure 2. Groupon 1Q20 resultsSource: Groupon 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenue in the quarter sank -35% y/y to $374.2 million; gross profit dollars, the more closely-watched top-line metric for Groupon, also fell -34% y/y to $201.2 million. Note, however, that Groupon was no stranger to declines: in the fourth quarter, Groupon's revenue was already trending at a -23% y/y rate of decline.Of course, when combining March with a relatively strong January and February, Q1's results were still deceptively stronger than Groupon's new baseline. The impact of the coronavirus actually bottomed out in April, as we can see in Groupon's monthly linearity chart below. And though Groupon notes that trends in the flagship Local business have improved slightly in May (green line below), May is still below where March was. Figure 3. Groupon post-Q1 trendsSource: Groupon Q1 earnings deckThis is a dire picture to paint for Q2, where Groupon has declined to provide specific guidance but instead vaguely noted that there will be a ""decline in gross billings and gross profit vs. 1Q2020 due to full quarter of lower demand and elevated refunds resulting from COVID-19."" Wall Street consensus, reported by Yahoo Finance, pegs Groupon's Q2 revenue at down -65% y/y. What can also be seen in the chart above is that Groupon has relied on sales of Goods to sustain revenue and cash flow. The company has turned to selling mundane, high-demand items like masks and hand sanitizer recently - which makes Groupon more of a common merchant than a true, differentiated internet business.Note that this move drags Groupon backwards from its plan to exit the low-margin Goods business. In its year-end 2019 report, Groupon described its strategy to leave the Goods business as follows:Note that Goods is still on the chopping block, with the company planning to start transitioning the Goods marketplace to a fully third-party operated model as early as Q2. So excluding the temporary sale of Goods on the Groupon marketplace, Groupon's actual revenue/gross profit dollar decline would have been much worse. One more thing to note: Groupon's Google search traffic volumes also corroborate that recovery has been slow. The chart below, taken from Google Trends, shows the search volume frequency for the term ""Groupon"" since the start of the year. The first week of January was the strongest and indexed at 100; the previous week indexed at 51, or approximately half of January's volumes.Figure 4. Groupon search volumesSource: Google TrendsWe're also worriedly monitoring Groupon's cash burn. Unsurprisingly, Groupon's free cash flow burn soared in the most recent Q1, with free cash flow losses of -$247.0 million growing 49% y/y versus the prior Q1. On a full-year basis, Groupon burned through roughly $78 million of cash over the trailing twelve months, but with Q1's accelerated burn rate plus the expectation of a substantially worse Q2, I fear that the forward-looking cash burn will be more acute.Figure 5. Groupon cash burnSource: Groupon 1Q20 earnings releaseAs of the end of May, Groupon noted that it had fairly ample cash balances of $767 million on its books, which is the good news. The company has also implemented cost reductions and layoffs that are expected to drive $125 million of annualized cost savings in 2021 ($100 million of impact in 2020). It's unclear, however, how much of these savings will be realized in cash (versus savings counted against stock-based comp and other non-cash expenses).Figure 6. Groupon coronavirus responseSource: Groupon Q1 earnings deckThe other fact that investors should be aware of is that Groupon's ~$767 million of cash doesn't come free and clear of debt. As of the end of March, Groupon had $150 million of short-term debt and $218.4 million of convertible debt (due in April 2022); the company also drew down an additional $50 million on its revolver in April (bringing total draws to $200 million out of $400 million in total capacity, per Groupon's 10-K). So in truth, Groupon's net cash position is really only around ~$350 million.Don't get caught in the Groupon value trap. It's unclear if consumers will gravitate back to Groupon in the post-coronavirus world; recent company-provided trends through May and Google Trends search data through June suggests the recovery will be very slow, if it recovers at all."

By being a marketplace for local experiences, Groupon thinks that it will be able to reinvent itself and return to profitability after years of sales decline. The problem with this plan is that the local experiences market relies on people connecting with each other, and it’s unlikely that Groupon will be able to get people to share experiences in the midst of a pandemic. Since the majority of its users are from North America, which is the epicenter of COVID-19 in the world right now, we don’t see how the company will benefit from fully pivoting to the local experience market.With a fully drawn credit facility and a history of failing on numerous projects, we believe that investing in Groupon is a risky endeavor with a high chance of getting a negative outcome. Not only did the company not provide its full-year guidance, but it also decided not to hold a conference call at the end of Q1, which is a red flag for us. Since it’s unlikely that Groupon will receive any financial benefit from the current restructuring this year, we believe that the company is uninvestable at this stage.The biggest advantage of Groupon is that it generates leads for businesses and receives a commission for it. By offering cheap deals on its platform, it’s able to attract a high number of consumers that are likely going to purchase products and services of various sellers that are present on Groupon’s platform. However, after deciding to become a shopping service itself, Groupon struggled to gain market share from companies like Amazon (AMZN), and its sales quickly deteriorated. Last year, the company even failed to meet its EBITDA guidance for the year, and its stock depreciated by more than 75%.In its latest earnings report for Q1, Groupon once again disappointed its shareholders, as its revenues were $351.7 million, down 35.3% Y/Y, while its net loss for the period was $210.9 million. As a result, the company trades at negative valuation multiples, and it has one of the worst margins among its peers.Source: Capital IQGroupon quickly realized that it needed a change and recently announced that it’ll close its goods business and pivot to the local experiences market. By doing so, the company will lose nearly half of its revenues that were coming from the goods business, and there’s no guarantee that its new business plan will create value. While in 2019 a total of $3.4 billion were spent on Groupon’s platform on local experiences, such as sports events, concerts, massages, etc., the company still doesn’t have an edge in the industry. By having TripAdvisor (TRIP), Airbnb (AIRB), and others as competitors, Groupon needs to improve its user interface and user experience if it wants to compete for market share. Right now, the goal of the company is to improve its booking process by giving its customers the ability to make reservations with one click only like it’s on Airbnb. Other than that, Groupon didn’t provide any additional information about its strategy.Another problem is that Groupon says that local experiences are a $1 trillion market. However, in its earnings slides, the company doesn’t cite the source for that number and only shows the market share of its peers based on their earnings reports, which is way below $1 trillion (Source: Latest earnings presentation, Slide 7). Even if that number is true, it’s hard for us to imagine how a company with less than $1 billion in market cap will be able to gain a substantial market share without spending lots of resources to compete in such a highly lucrative market.At the same time, we don’t think that changing a business model, which relies on a constant connection between humans in the midst of a pandemic, is a wise thing to do. Since the majority of its customers are from North America, which is currently the epicenter of COVID-19 in the world, it makes no sense for the company to expand its local experiences offering, especially with the fully drawn credit revolver. It’s unlikely that Groupon will gain any financial benefit from such a restructuring this year, and there’s a high chance that its net loss will widen as a result of this decision.There’s also no guarantee that Groupon will succeed by pivoting to local experiences. A few years ago, the company purchased Korean startup Ticket Monster but later sold it, as it didn’t know what to do with it. It also used lots of resources to aggressively expand in India, but later decided to exit the Indian market and focus on growth back at home. Groupon failed to create value in the goods business, and there’s a possibility that it’ll fail to gain market share in the local experiences market too. Considering its poor performance in the past, we believe that the company is uninvestable even at the current price.With liquidity of $767 million and $514 million in debt, it’s unlikely that Groupon will be able to aggressively expand in the local experiences market. After announcing poor results in Q1, company management didn’t even hold a conference call and didn’t share its strategic vision with the rest of the world. By not providing any guidance for the year ahead and not communicating with analysts through a conference call, it’s hard to even understand in which direction the company is moving. While Groupon will hold a conference call next week after announcing its Q2 results and will provide more details about its plans, we are likely going to remain convinced that more value will be lost in the next year as a result of its move to pivot to the local experiences market. Since the Street expects Groupon to be unprofitable at least for the next few years, we believe that it’s better to avoid the stock.Source: Seeking Alpha"

Any demand beyond this volume will move the share price significantly.GRPN's intrinsic value per share is at $80 as explained in my previous article: Groupon Is a Buy For A Patient Investor.","Groupon (GRPN) shares were moving by a staggering 40% up and down in the past week, without any significant news on the company. The reason behind that is that GRPN with a market cap of around $600m is virtually a micro-cap stock at the moment with a daily trading volume of 15m shares, so any order that is deeper than the market will move the share price significantly.On June 5-10, daily trading volume was over 25m, which has caused 40% price movements up and down.Source: TradingViewAt its AGM on June 9, Groupon approved the reverse stock split of 1-for-20 and implemented it on June 11th. Although the reverse share split doesn't change the company's fundamentals, it can be seen as negative by the market since the management admits that it doesn't expect the share price to rise to its previous highs on its own. If you look at reverse share splits historically, they are not necessarily a bad move. The benefit of the reverse stock split is that GRPN won't be a penny stock anymore, allowing it to continue trading on Nasdaq, eliminating the risk of being delisted.Just to show how underloved Groupon shares are compared to some other tech stocks; for example, Zoom (ZM), let's compare their revenues. Both companies can hit $1.8b in revenues in 2020. For Groupon, it would mean a 19% decline; for Zoom, an extraordinary 300% growth.Both companies are not extremely profitable. However, the market cap of Zoom is $60bn, meaning it is 100x larger than that of Groupon. Let it sink in. Two companies that have comparable sales volume and equally low profitability have a difference in valuation of 100 times. Zoom gave guidance for non-GAAP operating income margin of 19%, I predict that Groupon can achieve 15% after it exits goods and focuses on services. Therefore, the two companies will be similar not only when looking at their sales volume but also when looking at their profitability.The major difference between Groupon and Zoom is, of course, their growth prospects as perceived by the market. While Groupon is licking its wounds, changes management, tries to complete a turnaround, Zoom has a free ride on the back of COVID-19 from a surge in video conferencing. However, both companies are in the tech sector, with a huge market and virtually unlimited growth prospects. Should Groupon be able to achieve 20% growth after a year of decline in revenue, it will be at least a five-bagger stock. Or somewhere between 5x and 100x bagger, as judged by current Zoom valuation.For the intrinsic value analysis of Groupon, please check my previous article: Groupon Is a Buy For A Patient Investor.This enormous discrepancy in valuation between different stocks brings me to the topic of Robinhood investing. There has been news of a significant surge in the private brokerage accounts such as, for example, Robinhood. The overwhelming majority of these accounts tend to hold mega stocks, pushing up the share price for those stocks. Since the market crash in March, the private investors invested their money back into the stock market, whereas institutional investors remained on the sidelines. That could explain the discrepancies in valuations for different stocks with similar fundamentals.Now, imagine, Groupon manages to catch consumer attention again and activate its 43.6m customer base so that consumers not only buy the services offered on the Groupon app but actually also buy the stock.Groupon is a volatile stock and the volatility of its share price may continue in the future aided by the general market volatility.Should GRPN become a darling of private investors, like other tech have become, the share price may increase many-fold.Our current estimation of the intrinsic fair value per share is at $80.To watch: GRPN's Q1 earnings on June 16th."

However, I argue that investors are not likely to be rewarded here, even after this aggressive sell-off. Avoid this stock for now, but revisit it at a later stage. Here's why:(Source)The graph that follows doesn't need much clarification:Source: author's calculationsThere is a clear trend that the business model is unraveling.However much we wish to avoid dealing with the facts, it's undeniable -- Groupon was at one stage a promising enterprise with strong potential, however today, the facts paint a different and painful reality.When a company faces consistent declines of double digits, something is very wrong with its business model.To this effect, Groupon declares that it's exiting Goods business, stating that the landscape has become overly competitive and that customers are demanding expedient shipping on a fast array of products, which Groupon is poorly positioned to offer.Management highlights these long-term targets:What would one expect management to do? They have to give investors some hope, that's their job.Groupon notes that 2020 will be a challenging and unpredictable year as it navigates through situations that will be largely outside their control. There are high hopes that through 2020 and into 2021, Groupon will aim to remove as much as $125 million from its cost structure, allowing it to better leverage its revenues.Moreover, Groupon notes that 2020 and 2021 will be building years as Groupon looks to reposition itself in 2022 with mid single-digit growth on its revenues.There is always the chance that Groupon will make a surprisingly strong recovery, but this is highly unlikely.The most important action for investors is to avoid pricing anchoring. This means, just because the investor paid a higher price and is now holding onto a loss, that hoping that things will not get worse, hoping that they will be able to breakeven in time, is not a good investment strategy.In fact, investing in 'hope' rarely makes for a promising investment opportunity.The one aspect which keeps me fairly interested in this company's long-term prospects is its strong balance sheet. Groupon has a net cash position of more than $500 million.When asked on the call about its capital allocation priorities management was unwavering in its response, noting that it has no near-term intentions to repurchase its stock from these low levels, but rather seeks to reinvest back into its business.In my mind, although Groupon wishes to position itself in the Experiences marketplace, and it will come against tough competition from the likes of TripAdvisor (TRIP) that is similarly focused on the same strategy. Although, thus far, neither of these companies has gained any meaningful traction here.Groupon's market cap valuation has taken a huge beating. This becomes very attractive for contrarian investors. However, the most important aspect of investing is not to be contrarian for contrarian's sake but to be selective, contrarian, and correct.Investors need to put the odds firmly in their favor, and simply because Groupon has fallen in value, does not automatically imply that there is a strong bargain opportunity."
4354238,69905,2020-06-17T05:06:39-04:00,"Shelter-in-place weighed on Groupon's results, with full impact hardest felt in April.Groupon points to positive free cash flow during April and May.An unclear opportunity, I'm unsure that investors will be rewarded here, even at this valuation.","Groupon (GRPN) reported its Q1 2020 results which saw its highly anticipated Q1 2020 results beat analyst consensus both on its top line and bottom line. After a detailed appraisal of its financial performance and commentary, I'm not entirely convinced that shareholders will be rewarded here. Rather than seeing a company determined to strive for growth, we see a company being forced to adopt a brace position. Even at less than $700 million market cap, investors are unlikely to be rewarded here.In my previous article on Groupon, I noted that Groupon's balance sheet was strong and flexible and supportive of the bullish thesis. This quarter we now see that after drawing down on the revolver facility $150 million as well as, including its convertible notes, all together its net cash position fell to just $280 million.Subsequent to the quarter ending, during April, Groupon then further drew down on its revolver by $50 million.Its most recent figures, updated to May point towards Groupon's net cash position coming back up to approximately $350 million. Thus, after the grim Q1 period, its net cash position approximates the same level it was back in Q4 2019. Digging further, this quarter saw its cash flows from operations use $236 million, a dramatic step down from the $147 million for the same time a year ago.Note that, when calculating this cash flow from operation figure I've not included any capitalization of intangibles or capex spend. Also, we know this use of cash was made worse as customers demanded refunds as they could no longer use their vouchers due to shelter-in-place requirements. Thus, for all intents, Groupon's cash flows are looking grim. Of course, this forces some questions from its shareholders: is this quarter really as bad as it's going to get in the near-term? Or will the next quarter only see a small amount of stabilization? Put another way, is it the case that the company will continue to tick along, as a former shell of itself, without having another day in the sun? For now, obviously, investors are pessimistic about Groupon's realistic prospects, as they have been for a considerable amount of time. And we should acknowledge, thus far, bears have been on the correct side of the equation. Groupon's stockholder letter notes that although Q1 2019 was challenging, that Groupon didn't experience the full effect of the lockdown until April. Groupon proceeds to note that,Of course, Groupon had to say something positive, and saying it was less than bad than it has been, is the carrot for investors. Having said that, Groupon did point out that during April and May Groupon generated positive free cash flow. Given that during Q2 2019 last year Groupon's cash flows from operations were essentially breakeven this marks a terrific improvement not only versus Q1 2020, but compared with last year too.Particularly if we consider that Groupon's operations only really had to face the full force of the lockdown in April. This made me question what drove the company to positive free cash flow for April and May.In the letter, we can see that Groupon had significant clearance and promotional activities within its Goods segment. I would be willing to postulate that shedding excess inventory may have been the biggest driving force being the recent improvement in cash flow.Objectively, while shedding inventory is commended, this is not the same as Groupon growing its revenues, which is what investors require to drive shareholder returns.Groupon has long ago stated its imperative to move away from its dependence on its Goods segment, to unwind this business unit.Going forward, its interim CEO Aaron Cooper asserts that Groupon needs 'focus' to be relevant and that Groupon's best opportunity is in servicing Local experiences.Groupon's Local North American segment being its strongest opportunity, carries satisfactory margins, with gross margins of 31%. Accordingly, if Groupon did find a meaningful way to grow its Local opportunity this stock could be a promising investment opportunity.Shareholders had long ago readied themselves for grim Q1 2020 results, thus investors were not surprised when the bad news ultimately was delivered.Groupon's Local opportunity carries reasonable gross profit margins of 31%. If Groupon did find a way to reverse its revenue decline, delivered through hard numbers, investors would probably be willing to give this company the benefit of the doubt. For now, I suggest investors remain on the sidelines."
4352149,69905,2020-06-05T06:12:38-04:00,"With $750 million in cash on its balance sheet, something positive may happen.The near-term potential is likely to be unimpressive, and its revenues will continue to compress.Worthwhile following from the sidelines for any positive developments.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) trades close to an all-time low. However, it still has $750 million of cash on its balance sheet - a high figure for a company trading for approximately $750 million.Also, it has very strong insider ownership, as well as institutions holding its stock.Given the very recent exit of its CEO and COO, together with the implementation of its position pill, this company may still have some life left in it.Therefore, I'm reversing my bearish position I've held on this company and I'm now advocating for cautiously watching it from the sidelines.With a significant delay since Groupon's last reported results, the company will reveal its highly anticipated Q1 2020 results on the 16th of June for the quarter ending March.Given that the company has been through a turbulent period, with its shares fully collapsing, together with its CEO and COO having to abandon ship, it appears fully reasonable that its reporting has taken slightly longer than normal.Further, it has recently adopted a poison pill policy, which lasts until March next year. Its poison pill essentially states that if an entity is acquiring more than 10% (for active funds) or 20% (for passive funds), the company will substantially dilute the total number of shares outstanding.Put simply, the poison pill (Rights Plan) works to give the company approximately a year to demonstrate to the community that its prospects are undervalued.Accordingly, this move forced me to question its prospects. Indeed, we can see that Groupon has $750 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. This is offset by $250 million in the form of its convertible notes.Indeed, there's a clause in the rights plan to prevent shareholder group A-G Holdings, which already owns 7.5% of Groupon (page 57), from converting its $250 convertible notes over the coming year, thereby increasing its ownership of Groupon past this critical 10% threshold.In actuality, even though I've been tremendously bearish Groupon's prospects, and thus far been proven right, I question whether this still holds weight now? After all, its present market cap is $770 million, which given its net cash position is approximately $500 million implies that the underlying trading equity is somewhat cheap.At the time of its reported Q4 2019 results back in March, the company declared it was going to exit its Goods category and focus on Local experiences market:Source: Q4 2019 Press Statement; North America SegmentAs can be seen above, Groupon's Goods segment makes up approximately 47% of total revenue, but less than 15% of the company's North America gross profits.Note that largely similar dynamics take place in Groupon's International segment, but I've chosen to focus on its more mature operations in North America.Accordingly, Groupon's Goods category is barely profitable, and the company believes that it would be best to deploy energy towards higher-margin operations like Local.Nonetheless, compounding the issues for the company is that its Local segment is likely to have taken a significant hit on the back of COVID-19 and the lockdowns.Thus its near-term results will be less satisfactory than its potential in the fullest could turn out to be.Below are the company's 2022 long-term targets:(Source)Although 2019 was not a promising period for Groupon, it nevertheless still reached 10% EBITDA margins - $228 million adjusted EBITDA.Hence, given that the company is asking investors to be patient, will it turn its ship around? The promise of high-teens adjusted EBITDA margins more than two years away might sound rewarding in principle, but I question whether this is enough of a carrot for shareholders.Here's the main issue. It's difficult to make the argument that Groupon is a clear cut in the bargain basement.Because although it has fallen from grace and it trades for just 0.3x times its trailing sales, it has been largely losing relevancy as its revenues have been trending lower for more than six years - since 2014.On the other hand, I can't claim that, given the company's motivations to improve its operations, fire its CEO and COO, as well as implementing the position pill, it is expensive.On balance, Groupon appears to be resistant to throwing in the towel.Even though its shares trade near an all-time low, there is plenty of interest involved in not letting the company's equity sink. Its roster of shareholders includes none other than Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) which owns 5.8% of Groupon's stock.Even though it is difficult to reconcile the fact that its revenues continue to compress, there's nevertheless the fact that with $750 million of gross cash, this company with a market cap of just over $750 million might still have one final flash in the pan."
4313647,99986,2019-12-21T05:46:40-05:00,"Groupon has continued to massively underperform the S&P 500, down 30% year-to-date.While annual earnings per share continue to grow incrementally, the bigger issue is that revenue growth continues to slide on a year-over-year basis, with further acceleration to the downside.This issue is similar to what we saw with Trivago in FY-2018, with annual EPS growing, but revenues down materially year over year.Based on this, I continue to see Groupon as an Avoid, with no real signs of a turnaround yet.","While it's been a massive year for the S&P 500 (SPY) and the majority of its constituents, stock selection has been paramount when it comes to the total universe of US stocks. Despite the S&P 500 being up over 25% and the Nasdaq Composite up nearly 30%, Groupon (GRPN) has put up a (-) 30% return year-to-date, a 60% underperformance vs. its strongest benchmark. This weak performance for the stock is not surprising, given that the company continues to see year-over-year declines in revenue, with a 16% decline year-over-year in its most recent report. While revenue growth rates are expected to improve based on estimates as we head into FY-2020, they are still likely to remain in negative territory. Based on this, I continue to see Groupon as an Avoid and believe that any 25% rallies are selling opportunities.(Source: TC2000.com)Just over three months ago, I wrote my first article on Groupon and discussed that any sharp rallies in the stock would provide selling opportunities. The stock was trying to bottom out near $2.50 per share, but I expected any bounces into seasonal strength for the market to run into selling pressure into the top of the arch pattern I had shown on the chart. As we can see, this is almost precisely what played out, with the stock running into resistance at $3.00 last month, right near the arch resistance outlined. Since the run-up to the $3.00 level, the stock is now down 25% this month and has managed to put in new 52-week lows. I don't think this should be a surprise at all to investors, as I have never found stocks with negative sales growth year-over-year to make for decent investments. Instead, these stocks tend to significantly outperform the general market, even in a period when the major averages are strong like we've seen in 2019.(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com)As we can see from Groupon's Q3 earnings report, active global customers are continuing to trend down, with this figure down by 3.5 million year-over-year and another 900,000 in the most recent quarter. The company noted in its Q3 earnings call that active global customers are less their focus vs. gross profit per customer, but this metric hasn't made much progress either. On a year-over-year basis, global trailing-twelve-month gross profit per active customer is down $0.06, from $27.51 to $27.45. Therefore, until we see significant traction in gross profit per active customer, I do not believe we should be discounting the loss in active global customers, which has trended lower for six quarters in a row now. Let's take a closer look at the company's growth metrics below:(Source: Earnings Call Slides)As we can see from Groupon's quarterly revenues, there's no question that they are on the decline. Q4 2017 revenues peaked at $873.2 million and are forecasted to come in at $703.6 million based on Q4 2019 estimates. This figure translates to a drop-off in revenue of nearly 20% in just two years, with the brunt of this decline coming this year, with a (-) 12% year-over-year decline expected. This is significant as this is the company's strongest quarter typically, but this is nowhere near the same demand since FY-2017.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we dig deeper into quarterly revenue growth rates, we can see that quarterly revenue growth rates slipped from (-) 4% in Q4 2017 to (-) 16% in the most recent quarter. While the significant year-over-year decline in Q3 2019 is likely to mark the low, we aren't expecting to see much improvement as we head into Q4 2019 yet. Q4 2019 revenue estimates are currently sitting at $703.6 million, which would translate to a 12% decline year over year. It's worth noting that these estimates may end up being too ambitious after the company missed its estimates by over $28 million in the most recent quarter. Therefore, as a best-case scenario, I would expect Groupon to see revenues of $715.0 million for Q4 2019, representing a 10% decline year over year, which doesn't translate to a figure that is representative of a turnaround.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)The blue line in the above chart represents the quarterly growth rate, while the white line represents the two-quarter average. I like to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we can see, both the quarterly revenue growth rate and two-quarter average revenue growth rate should improve as we head into Q2 2020. However, while an improvement from double-digit year-over-year declines in revenue to low-single-digit might seem impressive, this is on the back of year-over-year growth of (-) 8% in Q1 2019 and a (-) 14% growth rate in Q2 2019. Therefore, the company is up against the easiest comps it's ever been up against, and we still expect to see modest declines. Based on this, I see no reason to entertain a turnaround until Groupon can return to high-single-digit growth in revenues on a year-over-year basis.Impressively, these year-over-year declines in revenue growth have translated to increases in annual EPS, mostly due to share buybacks, minor improvement in gross margins, and cost cutting. However, as I noted with Trivago (NASDAQ:TRVG) in my 2018 article, earnings growth should be discounted when it is not coupled with revenue growth. This is because growing annual EPS through cost-cutting measures is not sustainable long term. After a few years of cost cutting, there is only so much more a company can due to reduce costs, as this will generally halt growth in the bottom line. It's important to note that while Groupon is expected to grow annual EPS from $0.19 in FY-2018 to $0.25 in FY-2021, this is relatively weak growth, with a growth rate of just 30% over a period of three years. Generally, my cut-off for all companies is a minimum of 12% growth in annual EPS per year.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While the company highlighted in its call that SG&A is improving and was down 1% year over year, it is worth noting that most of this came from one-time benefits. As the below 10-Q excerpt shows, SG&A for the first nine months of 2019 was $619.1 million, down $57 million year over year from the same period in FY-2018. However, $40.4 million of this was due to a reduction in payments relating to a patent litigation case with IBM (IBM), and $15.1 million was due to a favorable impact in foreign currency exchange rates. Therefore, if we parse out these two items, the difference in SG&A from FY-2018 to FY-2019 was barely $1.5 million year over year, or a difference of less than 0.25%. Therefore, while cost cutting has been a strategy to bolster the bottom line in the past, it will likely get harder going forward to use this as a benefit for padding earnings growth.(Source: Earnings Call Slides)(Source: Form 10-Q)Based on the fact that Groupon's annual EPS growth is combined with negative growth in both active customers and revenues, I see this as low-quality earnings growth. Therefore, I believe the company will have a more difficult time meeting its earnings estimates going forward and would be surprised if the company can beat the forecast for $0.25 in EPS for FY-2021. My primary metric for assessing turnarounds in stocks is two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, and we are nowhere achieving this when it comes to Groupon.Let's take a look at the technical picture to see if there are any signs of improvement here:(Source: TC2000.com)As we can see from a long-term chart of Groupon, the stock continues to massively lag the S&P 500's performance, as it's one of the few stocks sitting next to new all-time lows while the market is at all-time highs. In addition, Groupon remains in an arch pattern that is weighing on the stock into rallies. While bounces up towards this downtrend line near $3.25 are possible, they will merely be noise within a bear market until this downtrend line is broken.(Source: TC2000.com)If we zoom into a daily chart, we can see that Groupon will likely break its short-term support this week at $2.40, which increases the probability that the stock is heading to new all-time lows below $2.15 next year. Strong resistance continues to sit at $3.00, and I would view any rallies up towards this level as opportunities for investors to exit their positions. I see absolutely no reason to hold a stock with weak fundamentals and negative downside momentum while most stocks are in bull markets. Therefore bottom-fishing at current levels is a high-risk proposition also.To summarize, I continue to see zero reasons to go bottom-fishing for Groupon shares, and I would expect bounces next year to provide selling opportunities. There is nothing impressive about earnings growth when it's combined with year-over-year declines in total revenue and erosion in active customers. Until the company can prove that its initiative of increasing gross profit per customer is paying off, I would give Groupon an Underperform Rating and view it as a sell into the $2.80-3.00 level."
4305371,105459,2019-11-11T09:25:43-05:00,Weak fundamentals are easy to write GRPN off as a zero-value stock.But we like GRPN's transactive business nature which makes it a nice M&A target.We see a 20% upside based on 6.5x 2020E EV/EBITDA.,"Groupon (GRPN) reported a mixed Q3 with revenue and gross profit missing consensus estimates while EBITDA was slightly better due to cost optimization. Management once again reiterated its full-year EBITDA guidance of $270m (flat YoY). Although we believe that the company will no doubt achieve their EBITDA target given the ongoing cost-cutting initiatives, we are more concerned by the multiple headwinds GRPN is facing such as declining user growth, North America Goods revenue and margin trending lower, and weakness expanding on the International side (initially, within the Goods, but it appears that local services are also showing weakness). Although Groupon Select is seeing some early traction with 260k subs and a 60% increase in frequency and 20% in average order volume, the ongoing investments into this segment are not contributing materially to gross margin to Q4 and beyond.The headline numbers for GRPN are not great due to the ongoing weakness in the underlying operating metrics, but we believe that GRPN could still have some value given its presence in the fast transaction-oriented restaurants, travel and local services verticals under an M&A scenario in which it is taken out by a larger internet platform in search, restaurant, food delivery, or online travel where GRPN's service and product offerings are complementary to the acquirers' core services. For example, GRPN could be a good add-on to both Google Maps (GOOGL) and Yelp (YELP) as diners browse through restaurants and see whether there are any promotions available. This feature is common in China where Meituan-Dianping (MEIT) (see: Meituan-Dianping: Rational Environment Driving Q3) merchants advertise coupons to attract traffic.That said, we think GRPN's valuation of 5x EV/EBITDA and 12.5x P/E is reasonable as it currently trades at the low-end of the internet services average. For event-driven investors that are looking for the M&A catalyst, the current valuation level provides a good entry-point as we believe the chance of M&A increases given the depressed valuation and the growing need for internet search service providers to expand beyond their traditional services.We value GRPN at 6.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2020E estimate given the -2% decline in revenue and a 7% expected growth in EBITDA due to cost-cutting. Our target EV multiple is a discount relative to its peers such as Yelp that trades at 7x forward EV/EBITDA and implies 15.5x P/E, which is at the low-end of the internet peers. Our 23% upside also factors in the potential for M&A in 2020.The biggest concern coming out of the quarter was the deceleration in the active customer base that was mostly driven by the weakness in North America where marketing expense was pulled back significantly as the company shifted focus from customer acquisition to operational efficiency.The decline in active customer base also resulted in the ongoing weakness in the North America Goods revenue that saw a further decline (-30% YoY vs. -25% in Q2).Local revenue also saw a -3% YoY decline in Q3, although the decline was incrementally better than Q2 when it was down 5% YoY. However, the take-rate has been trending lower, suggesting a discount is required to drive that sale.However, given the cost optimization carried out in North America, operating margin improved incrementally to 8% in Q3.On the international side, traffic headwind is likely to persist given the headwind in the UK. The more troubling sign is that GRPN's international growth was supposedly the growth area. However, International Goods revenue started to show signs of weakness and now International Local services are also showing similar signs.Given the declining operating metric and weakness in both North America and International, we believe that the best case for GRPN is to sell itself to a more established platform that operates within search, local reviews, OTA, food delivery, or foreign internet companies that are looking for a global presence.Although it is unclear whether GRPN is looking for any strategic reviews, what is clear to us is that it is a fast, local and transactive model that is a good fit for all of those sets that we mentioned above."
4353023,102472,2020-06-10T07:38:48-04:00,"After quarters of losing to competition in the Goods segment, Groupon finally made the decision to exit Goods and focus on local experiences, which consumers turn to after COVID-19.Groupon has a new management team, which is committed to deliver on a new strategy. The company has launched a poison pill to fend off hostile take overs.Groupon's shares are hugely undervalued and can more than double in the next year.","Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock has lost almost 60% of its value in the past couple of months and now represents an attractive buying opportunity with the investment horizon of more than one year.Groupon's sales have been on decline for the past 3 years. The company missed its own 2019 EBITDA guideline and the management announced the decision to exit the Goods category, which accounts for 50% of sales, by the end of 2020. All these news combined have resulted in sharp share price drop, declining by almost 50% in one day from $3.05/share to $1.7/share. We believe that the stock market has overreacted and Groupon has a good chance to deliver profitable growth in the future.Historically Goods category has been a low-margin business for Groupon, however, it served to attract customers to the platform and cross-sell other categories.

The gross profit margin for Goods has been declining over the years as the company got squeezed by the larger competitors, such as Amazon and the consumer tastes changed to faster shipping expedience, on which Groupon could not deliver.Management's decision to let go of Goods was the right move, which will allow the company to focus on developing Services category and local experiences as the more profitable part of the business.Actually, COVID-19 might even help Groupon to execute on its strategy as the consumers become aware of the fragility of local businesses and communities and 75% plan to make conscious effort to support them.The first priority should to increase the bookability of its offers. If you look at comparable services, such as Airbnb Experiences, there you can book the offer immediately. Currently 65% of Groupon's international dining inventory is bookable, however, when it comes to beauty & wellness, the percentage is very low. Often it requires an additional step, such as making the appointment by calling the service provider, which puts customers off in the world of one-click purchases. Groupon management has realized the shortcoming and made the increased bookability one of its priorities for Q1 2020.The second step should be to increase the brand awareness. Groupon no longer wants to be a go-to place for cheap bargains, the company wants to be a marketplace for local experiences. Therefore, the current and especially the potential consumers need to know about it.As Groupon will lose its Goods customers by the end of 2019 it will need new channels to attract new users, since a large portion of its consumers in the past came from goods before purchasing local services. After modernizing their app in Q2 2020, for Groupon it would be the prime time to launch an outdoor advertising campaign on city-lights, billboards etc. to make potential consumers aware of an extensive local experiences catalog available at Groupon app. So watch for Groupon outdoor advertising, which will be a sign that the company is moving in a right direction.The third point, which should make up the backbone of Groupon's future strategy is the company's interaction with service providers. Similar to other apps it should be easy for businesses to create their offers on Groupon and manage them. Should the company be able to execute on these three major pillars, it will be able to compensate all gross profit margin lost during the exit from the goods business.Groupon is to announce Q1 2020 earnings on June 16th, which are likely to be a bloodbath, due to the somewhat reduced demand for company's products and services due COVID-19 as well as the cost incurred from the ongoing restructuring plan. It will be the first results announcement for Aaron Cooper, the interim CEO and the second for the CFO Melissa Thomas. Curiously enough, Groupon's management does not plan to have an analyst call afterwards, and rather suggests individual calls with analysts. Also, the filing date for the Q1 results have been extended by 45 days.So what can we expect? Most likely Groupon's sales continued their decline and will come just under $500m for both Goods and Services combined. That might result in net loss of $90m or $16 cents per share. Market consensus for EPS currently stands at -$8 cents.Now we are approaching the end of Q2 and see the reopening of local service providers in the US and in Europe. Should Groupon be successful in boosting their revenues in services by 25%, it will significantly improve their gross profit margin to 70% thanks to the 90% gross profit margin for services. We expect the company to finish the year with $1,8b in Revenue (-19% compared to 2019) and around $300m in EBITDA.In our DCF analysis we assume a modest 5% sales growth in the years 1-10, perpetual growth of 2% and WACC of 11% to reflect the additional risk reward investors would require.Despite our conservative assumptions, the fair value of Groupon's shares amounts to $4 per share, which offers 166% upside to the current share price of $1,51 per share.Source: Company data, analyst's estimatesHowever, Groupon will be no longer a penny stock. During the AGM on June 11th Groupon's shareholders will be asked to vote for a reverse stock split of 1-for-15 to 1-for-20, with the ratio being chosen by the Board. It would mean that the fair price per share will increase to $60-$80 respectively, depending on the split.On a negative side, there are a number of class action lawsuits which have been filed by shareholders against the company. They accuse the management of not timely disclosing the information on Goods performance at the end of 2019. Groupon has lost about $1 bn in Market Cap between November 2019 and February 2020 and some shareholders might join the class action to claim back their losses. It is currently not clear if the company would agree to any settlements.On April 13th Groupon's Board of Directors announced the rights plan, a poison pill to fend off any hostile takeover attacks. According to the plan, should any investor acquire more than 10% or 20% of the company, all other shareholders will be entitled to purchase additional shares at reduced purchase price. We view it positive, as it would give the management a year of time to execute on the strategy and either continues as a stand-alone business or become an acquisition target at higher levels.Groupon's performance in the past few years has been disappointing. However, the management has made a tough decision to exit the goods segment and focus on services. Should this strategy be even moderately successful, Groupon's share price will adjust to $4, or $60-$80 after the reverse stock split. But it will take some time for the new management to execute the turnaround and the results will be seen in a year's time. Thus, Groupon is a good stock for a patient investor.To watch: Groupon's brand campaign, Q1 earnings announcement on June 16th"

It's an asset-light business, with a strong balance sheet. The problem is that Groupon is simply not finding the right strategy with each to monetize its large audience.Ultimately, this investment is best avoided, as its valuation still does not carry enough margin of safety.(Source)Groupon's business model certainly appears to be compelling enough, that if it was able to minimally proof to investors that its execution was gaining traction, and that it was in some way able to monetize its 45 million active customers (customers that have made a purchases over the past twelve months), the stock would find no difficulty in returning to the highs of two years ago (at least $3 billion market cap).Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsThe problem, though, is that when investors are presented with the above graph, something is demonstrably going wrong.To be fair, Groupon's management has long ago given up on pointing towards its top-line as a measure of its success. It now asserts that instead of going after volume (large numbers of customers), it has instead attempted to segment its customers so that Groupon can more efficiently target its audience.For instance, one avenue which Groupon has embarked on is a program called Select. Essentially, this is a subscription-based product where customers pay $4.99 a month and get discounts of up to 25% on certain purchases. On the back of this service, Groupon declares that members have higher purchase frequency and higher average order value.However, if we stop and reflect on this proposition: Groupon is offering a service for bargain hunters, where they pay up a monthly fee to be tied up to Groupon's platform? That doesn't make a whole of sense, particularly in the modern world where customers value convenience and immediate gratification. It may have worked in the past, but nowadays, I fail to see this working, and the numbers appear to reflect my overall sentiment.Moreover, even we no longer focus on Groupon revenues but instead turn our attention to Groupon's gross profits of $292 million which were down 10% compared with the same period a year ago, the same story repeats - not getting traction. Altogether, whatever management is attempting to deliver it is evidently not being reflected on its income statement.As a deep value investor, any time a battered stock shows up on my radar, and I see headlines including the word activists, I'm immediately excited - someone's coming to unlock shareholder value! The problem for Groupon is that there is simply no value to be unlocked - at least not enough.Looking back to 2017, and Groupon deployed large sums of capital to repurchase its stock at an average price of $5.34. Then, in 2018, it bought back at an average price of $3.09.In fact, over the past five years, Groupon has spent close to $900 million repurchasing its stock (approximately 60% of its market cap). And are shareholders better off?The total number of shares outstanding are down 15%, but at the same time, its share price is also down close to 65%, so shareholders are not better off.Further confounding troubles for shareholders, Groupon today carries close to $210 million in notes (debt), which offset its approximately $600 million of cash and cash equivalents. This means that Groupon only carries $400 million of net cash.Finally, when we consider that Groupon is unlikely to hit $100 million of free cash flow in 2019, activists don't have much in way of value to unlock. Case in point, management appears to think the same way, as the total number of shares repurchased is in line to amongst the lowest over the past several years.We can see that Groupon's controlling interest continues to get around $13 million in cash (and growing) each year, while Groupon itself is only making around $100 million of normalized free cash flow. In other words, there is simply not enough value left over for activists to unlock here.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4313010,69905,2019-12-17T18:27:51-05:00,Groupon's top line deceleration shows no sign of slowing down.Why Groupon is unlikely to hit its full-year 2019 guided $270 million target.Why investors should avoid this stock.,"Groupon's (GRPN) stock is being priced near all-time lows. This is typically a fertile hunting ground for contrarian value investors. But on this occasion, the market is vaguely right, and this is a stock best avoided.I follow many companies and I've learned from the school of hard knocks that when the company's earnings statement talks about the upcoming ""exciting experiences"" for customers to enjoy, I know that the company has lost its ability to meaningfully execute and grow sales.If you believe that I'm being overly dour, then please inspect the graph below:Source: author's calculationsThese are not minor declines in revenues, these are in actuality significant revenue declines, and the declines appear to be increasing, going from -8% at the start of the year, to -16% in Q3 2019.On the earnings call earlier last month, Groupon CEO Rich Williams noted that macro uncertainty in Europe dampened Groupon's full potential. What's more, Groupon's stockholder letter frankly noted that Groupon was being squeezed between 'sophisticated' customers and merchants with a huge array of choices. Altogether, leaving operators such as Groupon fighting in an increasingly fragmented market, in a race towards the bottom.Groupon's bullish thesis is largely contingent on Groupon reaching its full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $270 million.Looking back and comparing each quarter of 2019 with the same quarter in the prior year, we can see that Groupon's adjusted EBITDA thus far throughout 2019 has been down between 10% to 18% in each quarter.Consequently, given that Q4 of each year is typically Groupon's strongest quarter, and that for the trailing nine months of 2019, Groupon adjusted EBITDA has only reached $144 million, this implies that Groupon would need to reach a minimum of $126 million in Q4 2019 to reach its full-year target. Please see below:Given that Groupon is rapidly losing revenue sales, I fail to see how Q4 2019 is likely to reach $126 million, particularly given that Q4 2018 only reached $104 million. Further, during 2018 Groupon had significantly more sales through which to pull-up its bottom-line.Groupon makes for very speculative investment. On the one hand, if Groupon did succeed in stabilizing its operations, shareholders that paid up $1.5 billion for Groupon would be likely rewarded with a strong bargain opportunity.However, I fail to see any prospects for this enterprise to show any stability over the near term to medium term. Further confounding the thesis, if Groupon fails to hit its full-year 2019 target, investors are likely to lose all patience with the stock and decide to capitulate.At that point, the multiple investors will be willing to pay will start to rapidly compress, and sentiment would turn negative at a rapid clip.Bullish shareholders would be quick to point out that if things were as dire as I portray them, then Groupon would not have deployed $44 million towards share repurchases.Admittedly, this does look positive. But then, this statement needs to be countered with the fact that during the trailing nine months of 2019, Groupon has deployed close to 30% of its repurchase towards management's taxes on their vested shares. Additionally, a further $7 million (16% of total buyback) has been returned to Groupon's noncontrolling interest.Anyway, one appraises this investment, I would point out that Groupon's adjusted EBITDA is a very ephemeral figure that requires closer inspection.One positive aspect of the Groupon investment is that the short interest appears to have started stabilizing at approximately 5%-6% of the float. This implies, that for many short sellers, they no longer believe there is enough of a short thesis at this valuation.Nonetheless, on balance, I contend that this investment is still too speculative -- even at this entry point. Capital is best deployed towards other investment opportunities, with a smaller risk of permanent loss of capital."
4274095,69905,2019-07-09T13:49:57-04:00,"Groupon is attempting to mitigate its lack of revenue growth by targeting higher average order customers.Free cash flow is not strong, particularly for a mature company.Ultimately, Groupon's share price does not have the necessary margin of safety.","When I first started looking at Groupon (GRPN), I recognized many signs which make for a great value stock. Having fallen from grace, it continues to have plenty of negative investor sentiment factored into the share price. At the same time, it has a strong narrative which promises jam tomorrow.However, ultimately, although Groupon indeed has a lot going for it, I conclude by finding that its valuation leaves no margin of safety.(Source)Groupon has two underlying themes it is focused on. Firstly, to increase its gross margins and, secondly, to increase the number of customers using its platforms.In more detail, the first theme which Groupon has targeted is to fine-tune its resources away from a high volume platform towards a high-quality inventory particularly in health, beauty, and wellness segment, with the end game of having customers spend more on average order. Down the road, the idea is that this should translate into higher gross profits, despite having less revenue to work with.The second key theme which Groupon is passionately devoted towards is, attempting to broaden its platform's reach. This could, in fact, become a strong competitive advantage for Groupon if Groupon succeeded in growing its network, with more merchants as well as more customers.Furthermore, Groupon proclaims that it has more than 200 million downloads of its app. And that generally speaking, users of the apps are typically its best customers. What's more is that customers who have downloaded its app are more likely to use it when out and about, which, in turn, leads to greater engagement.A further benefit of having the app downloaded on users' phones is that it partly mitigates Groupon's SEO and email headwinds.So far, so good. Now onto a few of the negative aspects.Source: author's calculationsPresented above is the main problem, which shareholders can do little about. Any narrative or rhetoric which management pushes about having an 'opportunity to do more' is not being reflected in Groupon's top line.To be fair, this is not entirely management's fault. In fact, quite the opposite. This is simply the result of Groupon having done so well, which caused competition to proliferate.Having said that, CEO Rich Williams is not looking to sit there inert. During the last call, he described how card-linking could be a rewarding growth strategy for Groupon. This is still a nascent opportunity but early results from Chicago, New York, and L.A. have been promising so far.Moving on, as a value investor, I have plenty of battle scars from seeking out underpriced opportunities, which will have grim outlooks. As that's where the real returns are made. Given that Groupon is close to 5% shorted, my interest was piqued.However, just because something has a poor outlook, it does not always necessarily make it a bargain investment.In more detail, we can see that even though Groupon asserts that it generated $121 million of free cash flow for 2018, we can also see that this figure accounts for the frequent capitalization of intangibles, which reached $18 million for 2018.In other words, Groupon's free cash flow is sustainably likely to reach $100 million to $120 million and not much more. Hence, paying 20x free cash flow for a company with no growth is an inflated multiple.Groupon has a lot going for it, such as a management team with a strong vision. However, despite being an asset-light company, it is simply not gaining enough traction to generate sufficient free cash to support its $2 billion market cap valuation.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4285255,104012,2019-08-13T15:21:26-04:00,"Groupon, once-flying technology company is now valued at more than $1.5 billion.The main reason why Groupon will never be great again is because its model cannot work for the long term.While Groupon’s valuation makes sense, I don’t believe that it makes a good investment.","In the past one year, Groupon (GRPN) has lost 40% of its value. The once-flying technology company is now valued at more than $1.5 billion. This article will explain why Groupon does not make a good investment even at the current cheap valuation. The main thesis is that Groupon does not have any competitive advantage in the so-called local commerce. This is because companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are expanding their delivery capabilities. They also have incentive programs like Amazon Prime that have hundreds of millions of subscribers. Therefore, we believe that Groupon offers no value proposition to investors, even at the current cheap valuation.Ten years ago, Groupon was one of the most valued online retail startups in the United States. A profile by CNBC called it the fastest-growing ever. In fact, it was reported that Google (GOOG) had offered to buy the company for about $6 billion. In 2011, the company launched its IPO, and within a few months, the company was worth more than $15 billion. The good old days are gone, and the company has been declining since then.Groupon has a number of challenges as I will explain below. However, the company has a number of good things. First, the company's balance sheet is relatively strong based on the current capitalization. The company ended the recent quarter with more than $596 million in cash and short-term investments. Its total debt is slightly above $208 million. All of this debt is long-term in nature, which means that the interest payments are negligible. In 2018, the company spent just $21 million to cover interest. It also received $6 million from its short-term investments, bringing the net payments to about $15 million.Further, using most valuation metrics shows that Groupon is not an overvalued company. At the current valuation, investors are paying 11x the expected earnings for this year. This is slightly below the S&P 500 forward PE of about 16. Other retailers like Walmart, Etsy (ETSY), and Stitch Fix (SFIX) have a forward PE ratio of 40, 20, and 37 respectively. The same applies to the forward EV to EBITDA ratio, which is an ideal valuation metric for these types of companies. The company has a forward EV to EBITDA ratio of about 4.11, while the other comparable companies have a forward EV to EBITDA of 11.05, 34, and 31 respectively. When you combine this with the previous statement on balance sheet, you realize that Groupon is not overvalued at all.Another good thing about Groupon is its strong brand. According to a statement by the company, one in every five Americans use its products to find deals. In fact, according to SimilarWeb, Groupon is the sixth most popular shopping app in the iTunes after Amazon (AMZN), Nike (NIKE), Walmart (WMT), Wish, and OfferUp.It all boils down to this. With companies like Amazon offering services like Prime that enable same-day shipping, discounts, and additional services like music and video, it is difficult for Groupon to compete.The main reason why Groupon will never be great again is because its model cannot work for the long-term. When it was started, most retailers believed that the digital space would be a niche place. Big retailers like Walmart, Target (TGT), and Macy's (M) ignored the internet. Therefore, Groupon had a special market proposition to many local retailers in that it could bring more traffic and sales to them.Today, things have changed and most retailers have launched their e-commerce platforms. In fact, digital sales are the fastest growing areas for most retailers like Walmart and Target. Retail brands like those of Proctor & Gamble (PG) and Unilever (UL) have also launched their stores and are actively participating in marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN). Therefore, most of these companies prefer using their platforms to offer the discounts.In addition to this, millions of people are currently using Amazon (AMZN) Prime, which gives them free delivery. Amazon and Walmart are also offering same-day delivery. Groupon does not have this option. Instead, it charges its users $8.99 for 3-day express shipping. Most people are opting to use services like Prime that give them much more such as a free Prime Video subscription. Therefore, with the shipping cost and time out of the way, the big retailers have become ""local.""Add this to the fact that other platforms like Facebook (FB), and Snapchat (SNAP) have started to focus on the local market. Other smaller brands like OfferUp that didn't exist a few years ago are now popular with users. These competitors have contributed to the weak margins.Groupon's management has realized this but their action does not make sense. Instead of focusing on deals, the company has started to offer a marketplace for full-priced goods. In short, it is now competing with the big retailers like Amazon. The challenge with this is that most people who still use Groupon do so because of the deals. Further, a quick look at some basic things in Groupon's website shows that they are actually more expensive than those in Amazon. For example, a 64GB iPhone XR that sells at $679 in Amazon sells for $849 in Groupon. This Burberry spray goes for $38 in Amazon and $58 in Groupon.A good evidence to this is that the company's global active users has declined as shown below.Source: Seeking AlphaFurther, interest in Groupon on Google has faded as you can see in the five-year Google Trends chart below. Compare this growth with that of Walmart and Amazon.Source: Google TrendsMost importantly, the company's revenue growth has been non-existent as shown below. It is always risky to invest in a company with slow growth, especially if it does not pay dividends or buy back its stock.Source: YChartsFinally, Groupon has not created any incentive for people to shop in its websites and apps. In other words, unlike other companies like Walmart, Amazon, and to a small extent, eBay (EBAY), the company has not created incentives to keep the buyers coming. For example, with Amazon, there is an incentive to keep shopping because of the same-day delivery and the large variety of products. With Walmart, a service like Jet enables people to save more money as they shop.While Groupon's valuation makes sense, I don't believe that it makes a good investment. As mentioned, I believe that its discount model has been disrupted by the likes of eBay (EBAY) and Amazon. Other local companies that were not online in its early days now have their websites where they can give deals. Therefore, I believe that the management will have a tough time turning the business around."
4289618,99986,2019-09-04T14:55:13-04:00,"Groupon continues to see negative year-over-year revenue growth, with revenue growth accelerating to downside for the past three quarters in a row.Despite the share price being off 50% from Q3 2018 levels, no new funds are interested in buying the dip based on fund filings.While bounces are possible given how far the stock has fallen, I see the stock as an avoid given its weak fundamentals.","While many IPOs like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have enjoyed outstanding returns since their IPOs, Groupon (GRPN) has consistently stayed in the laggard bin, with other names like Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO). Despite many of these names growing earnings per share (EPS) during their very brief glory days post-IPO, a lack of revenue growth has eventually put an end to their earnings growth. Groupon (GRPN) has managed to grow annual EPS in nearly every year since its IPO, but the complete erosion in revenue growth suggests that this is unsustainable. Annual earnings per share growth that is` generated by cost-cutting measures and non-existent sales growth rarely ever has staying power. For this reason, I believe Groupon's FY-2020 EPS estimates of $0.22 are attainable, but will likely taper off shortly after. I do not believe the company's recent initiative to add a membership program will be able to turn this ship around, and I see the stock as an Avoid for this reason. While bounces are possible, I expect the stock to remain a serial laggard and believe 20%-plus rallies will get sold into. Ultimately, I do not see the potential reward of a possible turnaround as worth the risk of a move to more all-time lows, assuming it doesn't materialize.(Source: TC2000.com)Groupon has had a very tough year so far, with the stock shedding over 22% of its value, despite the S&P-500 (SPY) putting up a 15%-plus return so far year-to-date. This performance should not be surprising, especially after the most recent Q2 results saw a 14% drop in revenue growth year-over-year. This is the largest year-over-year drop in revenue growth over the past three years, and we continue to see a trend of acceleration to the downside. Another eyesore in the company's Q2 results was the erosion of active global customers. As we can see from the below slide, active global customers are down over 3 million since Q2 2018, now totaling 46.2 million from 49.3 million a year ago. The trailing-twelve-month gross profit per active customer growing at 1% year-over-year has hardly made up for this erosion. There is no way to sugarcoat these results. A loss in active customers with more or less flat growth in gross profit per customer is not a trend any company wants to see. The only real positive in the Q2 report came from the news that the company has officially rolled out a membership program called Select. The membership program provides members with better discounts and free shipping vs. non-paid members on the site. This has increased order frequency and higher average order value, and the company already has 150,000 members or about 0.3% of their total customer base. While the early adoption of this is encouraging, it is not surprising given the low price of $4.99/month for a membership. (Source: Company Presentation)In the recent earnings call, the company discussed that down the road they might be able to raise prices on Select as more partners on the program could command higher membership fees. While my opinion does not matter, I do not believe that the company is going to be able to command much higher prices than they are currently asking. Most customers are willing to pay $10.00 a month for Netflix (NFLX), Apple Music (AAPL), Audible (AMZN), and or Amazon Prime (AMZN), but I don't see Groupon's Select Service as nearly as sticky or necessary. The $5 a month option is doable and might be able to attract 1% - 2% of the total customer base, but I am doubtful a price hike will work. I simply do not see consumers having the same desire and need for a service like this at a price tag of $10 vs. Netflix (NFLX), which has significant purchasing power. Let's take a look at the company's earnings trend below.Looking at Groupon's earnings trend below, we can see that the company has managed to grow earnings per share at a reasonable rate since its IPO. Outside of a significant drop-off in 2016, annual EPS continues to make new highs. Based on current estimates for FY-2019 of $0.22, Groupon is expected to see 16% growth in annual EPS from last year's $0.19. However, the market is most interested in the next 12-18 months, and FY-2019 is already in the rearview mirror. With this in mind, the flat growth expected for FY-2020 based on current estimates of $0.22 explains why the stock does not care about this year's 16% annual EPS growth. In summary, while the earnings trend for Groupon is not by any means as it's making new highs, we are expecting to see no growth year-over-year in FY-2020. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Moving to revenue growth, there's little to like here as an investor. Revenue growth has declined on a year-over-year basis for all of the past eight quarters, and saw its worst quarter yet in Q2 2019, with a 14% decline in year-over-year revenue. This suggests that revenue growth is accelerating to the downside, and the two-quarter average revenue growth rate clearly shows us how things are trending. In the below chart, I have shown revenue growth rates in blue, and the two-quarter average revenue growth rate in white. The reason for the two-quarter average revenue growth rate is to smooth out any lumpy quarters and to define the actual trend better. As we can see, the two-quarter average revenue growth rate has gone from (-) 6% in Q3 2017 to (-) 11% in the most recent quarter. Essentially, this means that the company is seeing weaker growth year-over-year, and it's only getting worse each quarter. Based on Q3 2019 estimates, the company is expected to see revenues of $557.1 million, which will translate to another quarter of negative year-over-year growth to the tune of 6%. This is a significant red flag as growth is not sustainable when sales are contracting year-over-year.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Based on the above growth metrics, I don't see any way that Groupon's double-digit earnings growth can continue long-term. The company has mostly padded earnings per share growth through buybacks and cost savings during a two-year period when sales are declining year-over-year. Groupon recently bought back 4.2 million shares recently for $15 million at an average cost of $3.57. However, reducing the share count and cost-cutting are not sustainable ways to grow annual earnings per share. Eventually, the top-line weakness will leak onto the bottom line, and we see a glimpse of this with the flat year-over-year growth expected in FY-2020. Based on revenue growth trends, I believe the $0.22 estimates for FY-2020 are ambitious.To illustrate my point about SG&A, the company reduced SG&A costs 4% year-over-year. They also reduced their share count by another 1% this year with their buybacks. This all contributes to pumping up the bottom line. Unfortunately, for investors, there is a limit to how much savings can be realized among SG&A expenses, and it's unlikely the 4% drop in SG&A expenses will continue.(Source: Company Presentation)To summarize, Groupon is growing annual EPS through reduced SG&A spend and reduction of their share count, at a time when quarterly revenues are contracting materially. This type of earnings growth is not sustainable and is often a value trap for less experienced investors. While companies can get away with this for a few years, eventually earnings growth will roll over or flatline, as we're expected to see in FY-2020.So how are funds treating this recent 40% dip in the stock? Let's take a look:(Source: Reuters.com, Author's Chart)Looking at the above chart of fund data, we can see that new funds continued to enter Groupon up until Q2 2018. Since that quarter, however, which was the third quarter in a row of negative year-over-year revenue growth, the trend has been down. Despite Groupon being down over 40% since Q2 2018, no new funds are entering the stock, and prior funds continue to leave. This is evidenced by the total amount of funds holding Groupon dropping by nearly 15% from 324 to 281. This decline in fund ownership suggests that funds are not buying this dip, and are uninterested in going bottom-fishing during this decline. This is a divergence from 2016 through 2017 period, when fund ownership was increasing on the 50% decline from August 2016 to June 2017. If not for the aggressive buyback program with $260 million remaining on it currently, Groupon would likely have already made new all-time lows.Finally, looking at the technical picture, the company continues to be a significant laggard to the market. While the S&P-500 and major indices are above their 40-week moving averages, Groupon is down 20% for the year and below its 40-week moving average. The stock has built what looks to be a topping pattern with its second test now of the $2.50 area. While bounces are possible after what's been a violent drop since earnings, I would expect them to stall out at $3.00 or lower.(Source: TC2000.com)Groupon has vital support at the $2.40 level, and a weekly close below $2.35 would remove all support levels for the stock. With resistance levels stacked overhead at $2.90 and $3.85, I would expect the stock to fail into any 15-25% rallies. For the bulls, the only real hope here is a strong reversal at $2.40 and significant volume coming into the stock to suggest funds are buying the dip. Based on recent fund disclosures, they had no interest at $3.00, so I'm skeptical they are going to step up to the plate at $2.50 suddenly. As mentioned, bounces are possible for Groupon, but I believe they are opportunities for investors to lighten up their positions. Any rallies that cannot get through $3.85 on a weekly close are just oversold bounces within a long-term bear market.(Source: TC2000.com)While some analysts continue to try to find a bottom in Groupon in hopes of a turnaround, I am skeptical that it's going to happen. The recent membership initiative is a valiant effort by management to add recurring revenue and increase average revenue per user, but I would be shocked if we will see mass adoption by members. The company's negative year-over-year revenue growth rates are a red flag to sustainable earnings growth, and I do not believe that earnings per share can be propped up much longer unless this changes. Until Groupon can put in two consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, I see the stock as an avoid. Investors are going to want to see a minimum of $550 million in revenues for Q3 2019; any miss on this number and the stock is likely heading to new all-time lows below $2.30. I see Groupon as an avoid and would be using 20%-plus rallies to liquidate positions."

Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Grand View Research, the global chatbot market was valued at $191 million in 2016 and is projected to reach $1.25 billion by 2025.This represents a strong forecasted CAGR of 24.3% between 2017 and 2025.The main drivers for this expected growth are the efficiency benefits of chatbots, such as reduced operational costs, as well as various technological advancements in machine learning and AI.The North American region is projected to dominate the market due to rapid advancements in AI, IoT, and APIs, among others, as well as the increasing deployment of the technology in various business verticals.The Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow at the fastest rate of 24.7% during the period due to various technological advancements.Companies that provide chatbots include:Source: SentieoGRPN didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file a Form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of June 30, 2019, Groupon had $597 million in cash and equivalents and $1.1 billion in total liabilities, of which $208.1 million were convertible senior notes.Free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was a negative ($182.9 million).In the past 12 months, GRPN’s stock price has dropped 46.7% vs. the U.S. Online Retail benchmark’s drop of 2.7% and the broader overall U.S. market’s fall of 0.5%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Simply Wall StreetEarnings surprises versus consensus estimates in the past twelve quarters have been positive half the time, per the chart below:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in earnings calls has improved fairly consistently since early 2018, according to a linguistic analysis shown here:Source: SentieoGroupon acquired Presence AI to improve its ‘voucherless’ service enhancement, enabling users to book using only messaging and chat-based channels.As Groupon’s Chief Product Officer Sarah Butterfass stated in the deal announcement:So the deal appears likely to be a ‘team and technology’ acquisition, with a price tag of probably under $10 million.Additionally, Presence has been focused on the health, beauty and wellness industry, which is a focus area for Groupon, so the synergies there appear to be highly complementary.The acquisition will also provide Groupon with existing integrations with other booking applications, further extending its capabilities.While the deal won’t move the needle for GRPN stock in the short term, it provides investors with a window into management’s thinking about where it wants to devote resources, to areas such as automation, machine learning, and ‘intelligent’ technologies."
4260494,105080,2019-05-07T01:44:09-04:00,"Core to Groupon’s meteoric rise was the product it sells – access to deals.As the saying goes, “your margin is my opportunity,” and Groupon’s success attracted copycats.Groupon's balance sheet has a significant amount of cash, and the deals it does sell continue to generate a lot of cash flow.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.Earlier this quarter White Brook published research on Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN). The presentation can be found under “Investment Theses” on White Brook Capital’s website. Groupon is a deep value investment that while meaningful, is not a top 3 investment in terms of current allocation. I expect to realize the fullness of value over an extended period.In 2011, Groupon was an innovative company that married the internet with group purchasing. It was a time-tested source of successful innovation: use a new distribution platform to introduce a new audience to an existing source of value creation. For merchants focused on maximizing their gross profit dollars and customers reeling from the Great Recession and growing more comfortable with online purchasing, it was a great match. Its service drove large volumes to its merchant clients and its sales force used that volume to establish trusted advisor relationships.Since, the stock has fallen by over 75% as its client growth has turned to decline, and its volumes have stagnated.Core to Groupon’s meteoric rise was the product it sells – access to deals. While a good or service typically has incremental costs associated with generating that good or service, Groupon only sells access. The manufacturer or service provider is responsible for the cost to manufacture and fulfill. Margins are high and Groupon was well compensated for finding an audience. The key for Groupon was cost efficiently generating that audience. By being first and by being good at what they did, they built a business.As the saying goes, “your margin is my opportunity,” and Groupon’s success attracted copycats. The technology necessary to generate and redeem vouchers is relatively simple, needing few partners, and only the ability to generate an audience for a deal and a merchant to offer that deal. While that audience may be smaller and less suitable for long-term success with one provider than another, for a particular small merchant, it’s difficult to know that ahead of time and which provider is most appropriate. Adding to difficulties, the voucher redemption process was emasculating in the best circumstances. The economy, throughout the sector’s life, has also been in expansion, a headwind for a somewhat difficult to use deal product as its somewhat affluent audience experienced growing salaries and opportunity dampening the willingness to spend time searching for deals. As these dynamics played out over years, the most serious challenger to the throne in the heyday, Living Social, backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and once valued at $4.5 bn, was purchased by Groupon in 2016 for an immaterial amount.There are very few potential competitors to Groupon today with the breadth that it has, with most potential providers helplessly conflicted. Credit card companies, payment processors, and banks are paid on a percentage of transaction value. Their incentive is for consumers to spend as much money as possible with their card, not to drive volumes to a particular merchant. Best case, they encourage spending that otherwise wouldn’t occur – a more difficult proposition than directing spending to a particular merchant, as Groupon does. New financial technology players generally fall into the same bucket. Instead, over the past decade, companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) have gotten stronger. While offering a different proposition, they vie for mindshare within the SMB customer base and also promise to drive volumes. Groupon’s sales force’s trusted relationship is less special than it was, while the need to define the IRR of the deals is greater. It can compete on that basis, but it has to continually prove its proposition.For Groupon to be successful, it needs to be easy to use and relevant. While its competitors have atrophied, it has invested in solving the easy to use piece, having developed card-linked offers some years ago – if only deploying it now. Everyday relevance across a wide populace is a far bigger issue. As alluded to earlier, the continuing macroeconomic strength dampens organic mindshare gains, both for merchants and for consumers. Additionally, the site and the app haven’t evolved as the way we use our devices have. Groupon, probably wisely, realizes that people are unlikely to download two of its apps, but both the site and the app don’t encourage deep, every-day, use. Its marketplace of deals is thin and poorly arranged – designed to give the illusion of depth rather than feature specials, make search easy, and be a resource for consumers. It needs to be.Groupon's balance sheet has a significant amount of cash, and the deals it does sell continue to generate a lot of cash flow. Groupon is wisely reinvesting some of that cash flow back into the business, but even despite that, at these levels, the company generates in excess of 10% of its market capitalization in cash flow and trades at less than 5x EBITDA. That makes sense only for a business in terminal decline. I don’t believe that should be true, and if that trend can be nudged up to low growth, very healthy returns are likely."
4213763,22445,2018-10-24T09:01:47-04:00,"Groupon, as I have said in the past, is not a stock that I have bought on investment metrics.Instead, I have bought Groupon shares after a big dip, when I thought it traded at distressed valuations.Groupon shares are approaching such a valuation once again, and it might be an opportunity once more.","On my last article on Groupon (GRPN) back in February (How To Play Groupon Shares), I basically said the following:Well, today we are past fatigue and bordering on panic. While the company seems to be turning around for the past several years, it never really managed to get there. Just about every metric one looks at has been deteriorating for a long time now. GRPN Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsFor example revenue is on a longterm downward slideGRPN Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsFree cash flow has ticked up a little over the past several quarters, but I can't say it gets me excited when the stock was around $6.GRPN EPS Diluted (Annual) data by YChartsYes, the company has been cutting expenses and is sort of breaking even, however when the stock was at $5-6, the above EPS is nothing to get excited about.GRPN Total Current Assets (Annual) data by YChartsAnd while the balance sheet is not in trouble, there has been a slow-motion deterioration for a while now.GRPN Shares Outstanding data by YChartsFinally, in the past I had speculated with GRPN shares at bottoms, because I loved the fact that the company was constantly reducing the outstanding share count. Please note that bringing down outstanding shares from 680M to around 550M is no small accomplishment.However for several quarters now shares have been increasing. And with no reason to buy the stock based on the fundamentals (as I see them), there was no reason to buy shares at higher levels.For one thing if analysts have it right, the company is expected to make a profit of $0.22 for 2018 and $0.25 for 2019, with revenue being flat for the respective years. So while the above EPS is nothing to cheer about when the stock was $6 a share, at $3 a share it's not bad.In addition, any positive surprise on EPS or guidance should cause the stock to rally from current levels. I am not betting on a surprise, but you never know. In any case, even without a surprise, most bad news is probably already backed into stock.Also please note that the current market cap is about 50% of what it was at the beginning of 2018. With the market cap at about $1.8B, when you consider the valuation on a Price/Sales basis alone, there is a nice discount in the stock.Groupon will be reporting Q3'18 results on Wednesday, November 7, 2018, at 10:00am EST. I would be looking for any positive guidance on EPS and revenue. One of the reasons for the stock's investor fatigue, is that the company's revenue has not been growing for a while now. So any news on future revenue growth will be a catalyst for higher prices.Next I want you to consider the technicals of the stock.As you can see from the chart above, a long term trend-line has been broken to the downside. Also please note that the chart is on a weekly scale, and this downward trend will not reverse soon. There are two support levels that I have identified. One around the $3 level and one at $2 level. Unless something catastrophic is announced in the upcoming quarter, I find it difficult to imagine the stock could fall as low as the $2 level (although never say never).So I will be looking at the price action around $3. Unless we get a very positive quarter and a bounce to the upside, I expect the stock to consolidate around the $3 handle.So depending on what is said in conference call in the next 2 weeks, current levels are probably a great entry level, when overall market sentiment becomes more positive.I have played Groupon shares several times over the past years very successfully around the $3 level.While the fundamentals are not inspiring, I think shares trade at a very nice discount, that is exploitable when market sentiment becomes positive again.Obviously a lot will depend on what will be reported at the upcoming quarter, but in the absence of any positive news, I expect a consolidation and a rise in shares around the $3 handle."
4230211,104988,2018-12-26T11:45:17-05:00,"Groupon is overvalued at its current trading levels (at the time of this article $2.90 per share).External risk factors include e-commerce market saturation and industry trends that will ultimately eat away at earnings.Internal risk factors include management's new business model, anemic revenue growth, and rising SG&A/marketing expenses.Even with extremely favorable growth and margin assumptions (in the face of the above risk factors), Groupon's fair value is between $1.40 - $2.00 per share.","Groupon's (GRPN) business model is in at an inflection point. The company is moving its focus away from the legacy email voucher model that connects local merchants with local customers (higher margin, lower frequency) to a global marketplace model (lower margin, higher frequency). Currently, the voucher business constitutes the largest portion of gross profit.- Michael O. Randolfi, CFOIn the long term, the business is expected to even be ""voucherless"" according to the CFO. This means that GRPN is stepping into a saturated market with e-commerce giants such as Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Yelp (YELP) amidst the massive change to its business model. We see that GRPN's share price of $2.90 incorporates an enthusiastic growth outlook that transcends historical norms and implies strong growth in a new, saturated industry. Additionally, cost management assumptions that are reaching their peak in 2018 will not continue in the long term as the business aims to gain market share and expand its international footprint. We will walk through Groupon's industry environment, discuss historical financials, perform a valuation analysis that incorporates aggressive growth and margin assumptions, and conclude that the business is overvalued at current levels based on the aforementioned risks.Groupon revenue peaked in 2014 at $3.042B. The company has historically seen revenue decline as the business model shifts and competitive pressures mount:Source: YChartsInterestingly, Groupon's main competitors have managed to outpace in revenue growth over the past two years. In fact, Groupon's revenue growth in FY17 was negative:Source: YChartsIn addition to the historical revenue squeeze, we see operating margins below Groupon's main competitors. Groupon turned around its operating margin in 2016, however, can we expect the decline in operating expenses to continue moving forward?:Source: YChartsSource: YChartsHere, we will dive into the discounted cash flow valuation. These are our key assumptions:Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SEC Filings.Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SEC Filings.Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SEC Filings.As compared to today's share price, we see that this company is overvalued.Source: YChartsIf we take a look below at the results of the DCF, we see that there are very few scenarios where we reach a number close to the current trading range:Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SEC Filings.The Market Approach in this instance will be a sanity check to see if the range we obtained above makes sense. We will use Zynga (ZNGA), Twitter (TWTR), Yelp, GrubHub (GRUB), Etsy (ETSY) and eBay as comps. We will exclude Amazon due to its size and engagement in various industries. By selecting P/E ratios and EV/EBITDA ratios slightly below the median of these comps (data provided by Seeking Alpha) provides a range that closely fits the range obtained by the DCF.Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SeekingAlpha; SEC Filings.We see below that the DCF and market analyses yield a fair value below current trading levels:Source: Author's analysis and estimates; SeekingAlpha; SEC Filings.As mentioned above, we identify two operational areas of opportunity for Groupon: 1) Revenue growth and 2) maintaining or even further slimming its cost structure. Let's start with point 1. The numbers we see from the valuation above contain something we have not seen recently for Groupon: Positive annual revenue growth. There's a large amount of risk associated with Groupon's revenue numbers moving forward attributable to the change in business model, competitive environment, and changes in the global economy. If investors were to believe the current share price, they would need to assume that the long-term growth rate for this company transcends that of the overall U.S. economy's expected growth rate of 3 percent. Investors also would have to accept an above average multiple of nearly 68x, at the top of the comp range, to justify a share price of $2.84. Negative revenue growth and uncertainty from the surrounding industry and overall global economy make these assumptions hard to believe.In addition, the company is shifting its central purpose from being a localized coupon/discount provider to being a global full-price marketplace provider. This will certainly call for higher investments in marketing and SG&A. At that point, management will face a trade off between trimming costs and fostering top-line growth.Our analysis reveals that Groupon is overvalued at current levels based on the company's historical performance, external risk factors, and internal risk factors. Where Groupon once dominated a blue ocean to connect local businesses with customers and optimize pricing, one has to question how effective this company will be against competitors such as Amazon and eBay. The biggest takeaway from this analysis should be that the market already is pricing a long-term growth rate that more than doubles the long-term GDP projection of the U.S. With volatility in global markets due to geopolitical uncertainty, Groupon is now pressured more than ever before to serve the needs of small businesses and pick up those customers. It appears that there's no valuation discount in sight for this discount provider."
4186470,86896,2018-07-10T19:34:23-04:00,"I don't like stocks that lack earnings.Even with the modest turnaround through Q4'17 and into Q1'18, the company is faced with declining sales.Stock buybacks and now merger talk have propped the stock, but if a sale falls through, I don't see much value in Groupon.","News broke this morning that Groupon (GRPN) may be hunting for a buyer. Naturally, the stock is up today. Outside of a buyout, which would obviously make shareholders rejoice, the company has had a troubled history. Let's take a look at what this company has to offer to a potential new owner. As a whole, I don't like the business model. Even with the recent improvements in earnings, the company still isn't spurring revenue growth. Without revenue growth, I don't see a long-term story here.Since the IPO in 2011, Groupon investors haven't exactly gotten their monies worth. The stock has plummeted 72% since its inception. For a reference point, the S&P 500 increased by 120% in the same time frame. If, like me, you are guided by earnings, the company doesn't have much to offer. The online discounter has had a stagnant revenue stream for years. Sales peaked in 2014 at $3.19 billion and have been declining ever since. Fiscal 2017 revenues of $2.84 billion were 11% off that 2014 peak. That said, cost cutting and some non-operating income did allow Groupon to deliver positive earnings in 2017. Net income of $16.01 million bucked the annual trend of losses.As a whole, I remain unimpressed. $16 million does not make up for the hundreds of millions that have been lost in the last five years. Those earnings amounted to a mere $0.03 per diluted share. That's not nearly enough to justify the $4.78 price tag. The company couldn't even keep it consistent. The first quarter of 2018 returned to Groupon's habit of losses. Q1'18 net losses of $6.89 million definitely aren't what the doctor ordered. To be fair, management had admittedly done a nice job at curtailing the size of the firm's losses and overall financial performance. That net loss is a 72% improvement over last year's $24.9 million. That said, a loss is a loss.If the company doesn't get a buyer, I don't see a lot of value at the present time. Any changes that have been made have not increased the sales story. Furthermore, it's evident that e-commerce companies like Amazon (AMZN), and internet companies like Google (GOOGL) are sort of taking away Groupon's appeal. There are a lot of ways to small businesses to push their discounts through online advertising. Groupon doesn't seem all that necessary to me, and the greatest strength of any business is being able to make their services a necessity.The stock spiked a clean 10% today on the possibilities of the company finding buyers. I question whether any buyers will be willing to pay enough for investors to be satisfied. This company is way overvalued relative to its lack of meaningful earnings. If management can somehow drive the turnaround into a little clearer direction, with some meaningful sales growth, a good buyer might pounce on this one. At present, I see a company with a declining sales base, $200 million in long-term debt, and sporadic moments of profitability that become enveloped in subsequent losses. If you remove the buyout talk from the equation, all Groupon really has to offer its shareholders is the stock buybacks that have taken place. Diluted shares outstanding have shrunk by 15.3% since 2013. This has definitely contributed to keeping the stock price a little higher.To buy Groupon now, one had better be very confident in the success of a buyout. Otherwise, you're buying stock in a business with scarce income and shrinking revenues, all at a very big premium. I view Groupon as a hold at best."
4221601,22445,2018-11-13T06:06:13-05:00,"I have made good money over the years with Groupon, but it was never about the business or the fundamentals.For the most part, I bought Groupon shares when I thought shares were pounded enough, and traded in ""deep discount territory.""Currently, shares have been pounded enough that might merit a good trade, once we get a bullish technical signal.","Groupon's (GRPN) Q3'18 adjusted EPS came in at $0.04, a beat by $0.01, and on a GAAP basis EPS was $0.10, that beat by a whopping $0.08 per share.But when looking more closely at the press release, we read:In fact, the one-time IBM settlement was worth $0.07 per share for Q3. So if we exclude this one-time event, EPS would have been a lot less.Other than that, results were once again terrible across the board:GRPN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsAs you can see from the chart above, revenue has been on a steady decline for some time now. I'm not sure if the problem is management or the business model, but the fundamentals have deteriorated for several years now, and only recently has the company managed to make a profit.In order for any stock to go up in this market, one of the following has to be true:1) A company has to exhibit growth, positive cash flow, and at the margin positive adjusted EPSor2) Needs to have increasing profitability on an EPS basis and a reasonable P/ECompanies which do not have one of the above, usually end up with depressed stock valuations. In the case of Groupon, it's not growing and does not have a P/E that could justify its stock price. As such, the valuation of its shares becomes very depressed from time to time, and that is where I have bought them in the past.The question is, have we reached depressed valuation levels yet?GRPN PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsIf we look at the Price/Sales ratio chart above, whenever the stock reached at around 0.65 revenue, the stock bounced and I was a buyer at those levels. So the stock is within one of my depressed valuation parameters that might warrant a bounce.However, this time we are also in a very risk-averse environment. This means investors are less willing to speculate, trade and take chances, even with profitable stocks. So while the Price/Sales ratio has served me well in the past, it might not work so well this time.GRPN data by YChartsThe above chart depicts short interest for GRPN shares. If you look closely, you will notice that about 50M shares are currently sold short. This is the third time short interest has been at these levels over the past 2 years.The question is, are shares pounded enough to get short sellers to cover? We don't know yet, and we will only get such evidence (of short covering) from future data. We might suspect they are being covered but only if the stock rallies, which is not happening at the moment.On the downside, we need some kind of a positive development to induce short sellers to cover. On the one hand, the risk-off environment does not help, and the quarter's numbers just out were not great.Nevertheless, we do have two bullish elements that are a prerequisite for a bounce and perhaps a multi-month rally from current levels; Elevated short interest, and a low Price/Sales ratio of about 0.65.However, there is one more element that is a deterrent for higher prices, and that is of a technical nature.The chart above depicts GRPN shares on a weekly scale. The main deterrent for shares to rally from current levels is the MACD indicator.From my experience, the MACD needs to give a bullish buy signal on a weekly scale in order for shares to rally. Yes, there are exceptions, such as a piece of good news, but the quarter has already been reported, and the current risk-off environment does not help.So as I look at the MACD indicator above, I think the price of GRPN shares will go lower before they move higher. Especially since this market is in risk-off mode.When should you buy? Well, if you intend to buy GRPN shares for trading purposes or for any other reason, I would wait for the weekly MACD to turn bullish or I would place a bid at around the $2 handle (the lower support trend line in the chart).I have to admit I doubt if GRPN shares could fall as low as $2 a share, but this is a crazy market and you never know. In either case, my best guess is that it will take several weeks for the MACD to turn bullish so there is no need to rush.Groupon has never been a fundamental pick for me. It was always a short-term trade. I continue to have this attitude towards the stock, because time and time again the company has disappointed, and growth has been on a negative path for several years now.I intend to buy GRPN shares when I think they are pounded enough. Currently, they might just be in ""pounded enough"" territory based on the low Price/Sales ratio of 0.65. Also, the fact that short interest is elevated is another reason to be bullish.However, given the current risk-off mode of the market, GRPN shares might fall even further. As such, I would wait to get a bullish signal from the MACD indicator on a weekly scale."
4249598,69965,2019-03-18T18:55:07-04:00,"Groupon's management seems focused on improving the domestic goods business and also acknowledged ""interest"" in the Company as well.Segmentation is a popular explanation for a decline in customers. Can Groupon sell more to less people? Maybe.It doesn't get much press, yet Groupon is clearly free cash flow positive.A huge cash pile, free cash flow positive, and a cheap valuation suggest the shares are attractive as a stand-alone company or as an acquisition target.","To say that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been a challenging company to believe in is an understatement. The company has moved from a small daily deals business to an upstart online retailer, offering deals on experiences and travel as well. The crowded fields that Groupon operates in as well as a seemingly overly aggressive expansion have challenged the stock. For years, the shares have traded in a range of about $3 to $6. Investors holding the shares or considering buying them for a turnaround play may be wondering why bother? First, Groupon is sitting on tons of cash and is free cash flow positive. Second, Groupon's potential as an acquisition target suggests the shares may be significantly undervalued.CEO Rich Williams did say:He went on to say:Speaking of value, the word was used 13 times during the conference call. On the one hand, the company acknowledged its international customer growth of 165,000 net new customers. Unfortunately, Groupon's domestic customer base declined by 800,000 during the quarter due to, ""our continued customer segmentation."" The idea of segmentation being a reason for a decline of 800,000 customers is questionable at best. Were these customers contacted and told they were no longer worth being connected to Groupon? Did management decisions based on their purchasing intent or capabilities that they wouldn't be a good fit?In truth, the decline in customers is likely a function of Groupon not offering enough value. This has become a popular practice for companies, suggesting they have ""segmented"" their customer base to explain a decline. Even with this significant headwind, Groupon's EBITDA for 2018 came in at $270 million. Projections for 2019 suggest EBITDA will be flat at $270 million, and in 2020, the company expects growth to $300 million. In short, Groupon believes it can make more money from less customers by helping them purchase more frequently.The company expects to turn its fortunes around with two core principles. First, the company is willing to be promotional on the international front if it means gaining more customers. Management said of the International Goods division that:Of course, when pushing promotional pricing, ""it did result in lower margins."" If we look at the trend of Groupon's international revenue, there seems to be a slow, yet steady uptrend in place.(Source: Groupon Q4 earnings)Management's second leg of growth comes from an expectation to increase the purchase frequency of its loyal customers. The CEO put a clear focus on improving purchase intent during the last conference call as well.While this isn't going to be a popular opinion, he did point out that, ""our average customer is purchasing from us approximately once per quarter."" Given that some users go to companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), or others on a weekly or monthly basis, it's not surprising that Groupon expects it can increase purchase intent.It's one thing to hope that buyers will visit Groupon on a more frequent basis, it's another to hope that margins will improve. However, investors can't do much with hope and wishes. What gives Groupon's argument teeth is over the last two years, the company's margins bear out that it can make its largest business more profitable.(Source: Groupon Q4 earnings)Investors are all too familiar with how Groupon has struggled with revenue. Looking at the last two years, it's clear that the company's domestic goods business has been on a downward slope. That being said, the reason the goods business has been struggling is the company is trying to make this business sustainably profitable.Just as a quick point of comparison, in Q4 2016, the North American Goods gross profit margin was 11.9%. By Q4 2017, this business's margin improved to 16.4%, and as of last quarter, Groupon's domestic goods business carried a gross margin of 19.2%. If we look at Walmart to gauge Groupon's progress, the world's largest retailer carried a 24.4% gross margin overall last quarter. In the meantime, Walmart's U.S. eCommerce sales increased by 43% and are expected to increase by 35% in the short term.While Walmart gets a ton of press over eCommerce growth, there were two comments during the company's conference call that should give Groupon investors perspective. Walmart's CEO Doug McMillion discussing online profitability made clear that there is a challenge. He said:Walmart's CFO Brett Biggs spoke to this issue in more specific terms. The CFO said:In short, Walmart is struggling with what Groupon is already addressing. Walmart is growing domestic online sales but losing money. In the meantime, Groupon's domestic goods gross profit margin has nearly doubled in just two years. If an increase in margins was the only thing Groupon had going for it, I wouldn't recommend the stock, but that is in fact just one piece of the puzzle.Groupon is a tale of two different businesses struggling against each other. Ironically, the company's goods business is also split in half between two seemingly different goals. On the domestic side of the house, Groupon Goods is focused on moving toward sustained profitability. On the international side, Groupon Goods seems to be focused on sales growth. The positive news for investors is while the goods business tries to find balance, the local and travel businesses are ridiculously profitable.Just to drive this point home, though Goods represented 61% of current quarter revenue, almost 77% of gross profits came from local and travel deals. Local and travel revenue and profit haven't exactly set the world on fire. However, there is stability that investors shouldn't overlook.(Source: Groupon Q4 earnings)While some might be surprised at these results, this is a core reason to consider the shares. Profits from local and travel provide a baseline of profits that boost free cash flow for the company.In the last three months, Groupon generated just over $58 million in core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capex). On the surface, if we look at the massive free cash flow that Walmart generates, the reason to own Groupon shares seems hopeless. Over the last 12 months, Walmart's average quarterly core free cash flow has been nearly $6.6 billion.However, if we compare the cash flow generated by each company per dollar of revenue, the comparison gets much more interesting. In the last quarter, Groupon generated $0.07 of core free cash flow per $1 of revenue. By point of comparison, Walmart produced $0.03 of core free cash flow per $1 of revenue over the last twelve months.In addition, Groupon is looking to improve its cash flow further by taking some costs out of the equation. In the last year, Walmart's SG&A expenses equaled 20% of the company's revenue. By point of comparison, Groupon's SG&A expenses came to 24.3% of revenue last quarter, which was down from 25.7% in the prior year. Even if Groupon were only able to improve SG&A expenses by 2%, this would have added nearly $16 million to the company's bottom line in the last quarter.With Groupon showing vastly improving margins on its domestic goods business and generating significant free cash flow, why isn't the stock doing more? There are several parts to this answer. First, if we look at Groupon's valuation relative to Walmart, the numbers seem to favor Groupon significantly.(Source: Yahoo Finance for GRPN and WMT)The comparison is nearly laughable. Clearly, Walmart and Groupon play on a different field when it comes to revenue generation. Yet, the same customer that shops at Walmart may also be buying deals or goods from Groupon. Customers don't care how big or small the company is, they just want a good deal.Whether Groupon will generate over 22% EPS growth in the next few years is a fair question. Over the last four quarters, Groupon beat estimates twice and missed them twice. However, if we look at the overall picture, Groupon beat estimates by a total of $0.01 per share over the last four quarters. Analysts have been right on the money over the last year, which seems to argue that future earnings projections may be on point as well.Second, Groupon's net cash position is a key factor in the potential behind the shares. As of last quarter, the company was sitting on $639 million in net cash. By point of comparison, Groupon's current market capitalization sits at roughly $2 billion. With cash at over 30% of Groupon's total capitalization, investors are paying very little for the actual business. It would be one thing if Groupon were burning through cash, but instead, it is clearly free cash flow positive.Third, Groupon has value as an acquisition target. The company itself mentioned ""interest"" and yet investors are being told management must do what is best for shareholders. Reading between the lines suggest that Groupon may have already been approached by an acquirer, yet the price wasn't right. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and IAC (NASDAQ:IAC) have been mentioned as potential suitors.To this end, there is a different suitor who seems to make much more sense. Yelp (NYSE:YELP) seems to be a near perfect fit to acquire Groupon. Yelp said in its last earnings report that it has a few core targets for this year. The company expects to, ""expand our product offerings, drive more value to business customers, and enhance the customer experience."" Being able to bring Groupon deals to Yelp business pages seems a natural fit. Yelp's gross margin sits north of 90% and Groupon's Local and Travel businesses share this high-margin trait.When it comes to valuation, Groupon trades at less than 1X its trailing annual revenue. By comparison, Yelp is valued at about 3X its annual revenue. An all-stock deal from Yelp, at a value of 2X Groupon's annual revenue would equal $5.2 billion. It seems unlikely that Groupon would fetch a premium of more than double its current value. However, even at $4 billion, it seems Yelp would be getting quite a deal.An all-stock deal would dilute Yelp's share count, yet the company is expected to grow its own EPS over the next five years by more than 30%. It seems clear a combined Yelp and Groupon would be able to cut costs and could offer broader solutions, which would drive more value to the many businesses that both companies serve. In addition, Yelp would benefit from the over $600 million in cash that Groupon brings to the table, plus increased free cash flow.The bottom line is Groupon is improving on its own, yet also carries value as a potential acquisition target. It's rare to find a company with significant cash, positive free cash flow, and improving margins, that carries such a valuation. Long-suffering investors should continue to be patient. For potential buyers of Groupon, now is the time. The shares trade at about the mid-point of their 52-week high and low. At a reasonable acquisition value, the stock seems to trade at a huge discount. Even if the company is not acquired, the shares seem too cheap to ignore."
4196418,69965,2018-08-08T13:26:08-04:00,"How does Groupon sell at full price?. It doesn't.If Goods is the future for Groupon, the future involves more red ink.Customers seem to be finding better deals elsewhere; investors should probably follow suit.","Oh Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), how frustrating you have been for investors. Not that many years ago, the company seemed like a misunderstood growth story. Groupon’s traditional service revenue was flat, but Goods revenue was exploding. The company’s international aspirations were in their infancy, and it seemed investors should expect positive returns. That was essentially my thesis on the company in 2015. Since that time, the business that seemed to be Groupon’s future, now seems destined to destroy shareholder value.When Groupon Goods was introduced, investors got very excited. The theory was simple, take the huge margins on local deals, blend in massive growth from the sale of Goods, and revenue and earnings growth would follow. Unfortunately, even Groupon management is realizing the current setup isn’t working.Groupon’s CEO Rich Williams indicated more full price offerings are coming. He said on the last conference call, “If you’re going to transact at full-price on our platform, you need to get extra value. And for us, that extra value can be just a better experience. It doesn’t always have to be 50% off or 30% off.” This is a massive shift for the company and not easily navigated.The company’s name is designed to invoke the idea of a group coupon. The sale of Goods has been growing, because customers are usually willing to wait a little longer to get a better deal. There is no shortage of companies offering the same items. The question facing Groupon is, why would a customer buy at full price, to get the item slower than their competition?Let’s look at a sample purchase available through Groupon and compare the options through two other sites value conscious customers might visit, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).(Source: Groupon – eBay – Walmart web sites)Now this is just one example, and we’ve left out the 800-lb gorilla Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) from the equation. However, the challenge facing Groupon if it wants to compete at full price seems obvious. In short, the type of value-oriented customers that are attracted to Groupon, are going to shop around. It takes about two minutes to look at the information above.Any buyer could realize they can get a $50 discount, a grade A refurbished (from eBay) iPad Air 2, as opposed to a grade B item from Groupon, and they get it multiple days more quickly. In short, Groupon is trying to sell the same items you can buy on Walmart or eBay’s website, yet at full price the deal makes no sense.The basic premise of most Groupon bulls is, the company’s Goods business will continue to grow, and margins will improve. In the meantime, the traditional service businesses may show declines. Using these assumptions, we get some scary numbers. Let’s work with these assumptions and see where Groupon lands in the next few years.(Source: amounts in millions - author projections)We can see that revenue in this scenario hits a trough in 2020, and begins to climb, reaching an annual growth rate of 4% by 2023. This would seem to be good news, but what this does to the company’s margins is a significant negative.(Source: amounts in millions - author projections)As International Goods becomes a bigger part of the puzzle, its significantly lower gross margin puts a squeeze on Groupon’s earnings. By 2023, Groupon’s gross margin has dropped to just over 42%. The company’s SG&A and Marketing expenses hold steady at 35% and 15% of total revenue respectively. The bottom line result? Groupon’s net income steadily declines from a loss of about $4 million next year, to losses exceeding $45 million annually by 2023.It’s possible that Groupon finds a way to stem the losses in its North American businesses, yet the company’s focus on full-price transactions seems to argue against that conclusion. It’s also possible the company increases its margins on Goods as revenue grows Internationally. However, for Groupon to end with a positive net income figure by 2023 would require the International Goods business to nearly double its gross margin to more than 30%. To put that idea in perspective, Walmart only garners a 25% gross margin. Connected to these issues, Groupon has run through more than 30% of its net cash position in the last six months alone.For point of comparison. Walmart is growing revenue relatively slowly, yet the company generated over $3 billion in core free cash flow in the last three months. eBay’s future growth likely comes from overseas, but the company is sitting on nearly $1 billion in net cash and generates significant free cash flow. If Groupon’s Goods business continues to grow, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where Groupon’s cash burn woes aren’t an issue.Groupon management is saying all the right things hoping that investors will ignore reality. The company’s growth has come on the back of bargain shoppers looking for a deal they can’t get anywhere else. Throughout Groupon’s last earnings report, the company’s future was clear. When explaining the revenue decline, the reason was, “continued focus on revenue generation that maximizes gross profit.” The improved margin on the Goods business was explained as, “our continued focus on optimizing for gross profit.”It seems some analysts are buying into this idea as well. The company is expected to grow annual EPS by more than 30% over the next five years yet sells at a forward P/E of just over 18. Based on what we’ve looked at, those numbers seem to come from an alternate reality. Buyers aren’t being given a significant reason to transact at full price with Groupon. Higher prices and slower delivery are a combination that won’t fly in today’s immediate delivery culture.Walmart isn’t as exciting of a story to follow as Groupon’s turnaround attempt, but investors get a 2.3% yield, and growth that analysts may be underestimating. Walmart invested $16 billion in Flipkart (FPKT), to try and take a significant portion of India’s e-Commerce market. In the next few years, this investment could represent billions of dollars in sales for the retail giant.Investors looking for a company connecting buyers and sellers, that has both positive cash flow and growth, eBay would be a better choice. Analysts are calling for growth of 14% annually in eBay’s EPS over the next five years. eBay sells at just 13 times next year’s earnings projections, and in the last quarter, eBay generated over $500 million in core free cash flow.Groupon stock is more than 25% off its 52-week high, and it seems the shares are headed toward an important technical level. Three times in the last several months shares have found support at about $4.30. If Groupon shares decline past this figure, investors should look out below. In the same way that customers are leaving Groupon to go elsewhere, investors should probably do likewise."
4148288,22445,2018-02-20T10:04:21-05:00,"While Groupon's Q4 and full 2017 results were not bad, they were short of expectations.
        Coupled with the poor forward guidance given by the company, there are not many reasons for the stock to rise in 2018.
        When stocks do not have a catalyst to rise, investor fatigue comes into play, and many times stocks fall much further than they should.
        That's what I think might happen to Groupon shares during 2018. And it happens, we will have a great opportunity to buy shares at a very cheap price.","Groupon's (GRPN) Q4'17 and full year results were actually not bad, just short of expectations. Total revenue for Q4'17 came in at $873.2M, ahead of expectation by about $20M, but that was still down by 3.5% Y/Y.On the bright side, the company reported a net profit of $47.7M for the quarter, that was an about-face from the net loss of $52.6M Y/Y. The company reported a profit of $0.07, but that was shy of expectations by $0.02 per share.Among the other highlights for the quarter, North America active customers reached 32.7M in 2017, an increase of about 200,000. My take is that this is not an impressive number, but nevertheless positive. Gross Billings for the full year were $5.65B, down 1% Y/Y, and revenue reached $2.84B, down 6% Y/Y respectively. However adjusted EBITDA for Q4'17 reached $105.3M vs $80.2M Y/Y, a new record for the company.Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $249.9M vs $179.9M in 2016, up 39% Y/Y. This even as global units sold declined 3% Y/Y.Overall, the company's Q4 and full year results represent the continuing effort by the company to maximize gross profit, shift towards higher margin offerings, and concentrate on local goods and services. The company repurchased 16,906,334 shares of common stock for about $60M in 2017, and has about $135M still available for share repurchases under the company's share repurchase program as of December 31, 2017.However, despite this, the share count remained about the same levels on a Y/Y basis.In the past, I have been bullish on GRPN because of the company's share repurchase program. Not so much because EPS would increase (as a result of a lower share count), but because a lower share count would eventually put upward pressure on shares, if and when the company had any positive news.And the company has had may pieces of positive news in the past, and we have seen wild swings in the stock that I have been able to exploit. However, in the absence of shares continuing to shrink, I have one less incentive to buy GRPN shares.Now I do not know if the company will continue to repurchase shares, however the balance sheet is becoming less capable of handling such repurchases. The working capital ratio (Current Assets/Current Liabilities) -- something that I follow closely in companies that repurchase shares -- is skating on thin ice in the case of GRPN. Yes, the company produced $78M in free cash flow in 2017 (non-GAAP financial measure), however that was just enough to cover repurchases for the entire year.And while the company should produce even more free cash flow in 2018, the truth is that the company is still in turn around transition, and if I were the CEO I would rather keep all the cash I could, instead of using it for repurchases at this time.So while the company still has about $135M under its repurchase program, I doubt if it will excessive the remaining repurchase amount at this time. And even if continues repurchases shares, it might not be enough to compensate for share compensation (as was the case in 2017).Something else that might be a deterrent for investors is forward guidance. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2018 was $260M to $270M. While this is an improvement from the $249 in adjusted EBITDA for 2017, it's not a big enough percentage difference to get me exited about GRPN shares.How to play Groupon for the next 6 monthsAccording to Market Beat, the average analyst price target for GRPN shares is $4.95. However, please note that since $Q4 results were published, JPMorgan lowered its price target from $6 to $5, while Morgan Stanley reiterated its sell rating and $4.30 price target. Meaning, we might see more analysts lower their price targets, and the average price target might fall below the current $4.95 price target in the future.sourceOn Wall Street, when something is not a screaming buy, then it's a sell. Even stocks that are a hold, are essentially a sell. Eventually investors get tired of holding stocks that do not have a good chance to appreciate and sell them. This even if they sell below average analyst price targets. So eventually what happens is, many times stocks reach depressed levels. Not because they deserve to be so low, but because the market just got tired. And many times that's where a great opportunity lies, as has been the case with GRPN many times in the past for me.So the next question is, how low can GRPN shares go, and where might the opportunity to buy them be. The above chart is on a weekly scale. All my indicators point to lower prices in the weeks and months ahead. Assuming the market gets tired of GRPN (as I think it will), or we get another major correction like the one we had recently, there is a good chance GRPN shares might reach as low as $3 in the next several months.If that happens, I would be more than a willing buyer. To date at least, I consider the $3 handle extremely depressed and I would be willing to buy shares and sit on them, even if no positive developments were to develop soon. Eventually positive developments should develop, because I think the company is doing a good job turning around. So if we get a chance to buy at the $3 level in the future, I think investors will eventually see mythical returns.Bottom line GRPN's Q4 results were not bad, just shy of expectations. The fact that the company was profitable for a change is a giant positive leap towards its turn around effort.However management's efforts to turn the company around, are taking longer than I thought. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $260M to $270M is evidence of this. The market will not get excited about such a number. Either growth above 20% has to kick in, or much higher profitability. Currently we have neither.And when the market is not excited, it does not bid up shares. And when shares do not go up, they usually got down. And many times shares fall more than we could imagine and become very depressed. I think this might happen to GRPN shares over the next 1-2 quarters. Shares might reach as low as $3 a share. But not because that's what shares are worth, but because of market fatigue. And it that happens, GRPN will be a great buying opportunity.However if GRPN shares do not fall by a lot, then there is no incentive yet to be a buyer (my opinion). I like the company, but I will stay on the sidelines until I see very depressed share levels, or until a positive catalyst develops."
4147912,103480,2018-02-17T05:56:25-05:00,"Groupon tanked ~10% this week after a mixed quarter, with a beat on the top line and a slight EPS miss ($0.07 vs. consensus of $0.09).Investors' biggest beef, however, was that adjusted EBITDA guidance for FY18 of $260-$270 million fell short of expectations.Still, however, given the company currently only has a $1.8 billion enterprise value, shares look extremely attractive at 7x EV/FY18 EBITDA.Earnings comps in 2018 will be easier thanks to 2017's revenue declines due to the exit of several countries which Groupon deemed unprofitable to operate.Despite slight revenue downturns, Groupon's focus on gross margin growth is succeeding.","The fourth quarter was not a kind event for Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) investors. The stock continued the beating it has endured since last fall, sinking more than 10% after posting results that included a beat to the top line but a miss to EPS forecasts. In addition, the company guided to lower adjusted EBITDA in 2018 than Wall Street was expecting.There are many ways to interpret Groupon's earnings this quarter, and given the high degree of flux Groupon has seen this year with the exits of several international units that brought down total revenues, the wider investment community isn't quite sure what to make of Groupon at the moment. Certainly Groupon and its ilk haven't been market favorites in the past few years, as investors cheer on high-riding tech stocks and dump the perceived ""dinosaurs"" of the dot-com era such as Groupon and Yelp (NYSE: YELP).Yet, while these platforms aren't as obviously successful as the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), they do serve an important niche in the market for local goods and services. A shopper isn't going to be able to find local restaurant reviews or dinner deals on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or any of the large e-commerce sites. Groupon knows that it has the upper hand in this market, and it has smartly refocused its operations to focus on just that. In addition to exiting several loss-leading countries (which is responsible for the revenue decline, but will contribute to profit growth), Groupon is returning its focus to its Local segment, which constitute the deal vouchers that we are most familiar with and for which Groupon gets a third-party fee. Local revenues are much more profitable on a gross margin basis than Groupon's Direct segment, which retails products such as electronics and home goods.No one is arguing that Groupon will stage an amazing comeback and become the toast of Silicon Valley again. The bull thesis, rather, rests on the fact that the company has recognized its identity and place in the current landscape and adapted its strategy accordingly. Along with the country exits (the company now operates in only 15 countries, versus nearly 50 a few years ago), Groupon has also executed a companywide restructuring (aka, layoffs) to improve profitability. Thus far, efforts are working well. Though Wall Street is looking down on Groupon's $260-$270 million EBITDA guidance for FY18, the midpoint of that range still represents 6% growth over FY17 EBITDA of $250 million - not entirely bad for a company thought to be in decline.Even high-performing companies don't make for attractive investments if valued too richly, and conversely, even lower-growth companies can be excellent plays if the price is right. Groupon, obviously, falls into that second bucket.I first wrote on Groupon in mid-December, when the company was trading in the high $5s. Even back then, I had thought the company was cheap and set a price target of 10x EV/FY18 EBITDA, or $6.50. In constructing that price target, I had assumed back then a 20% lift in EBITDA to $300 million in FY17, a strong assumption considering Wall Street consensus was at $272 million. Now, obviously, with Groupon's EBITDA guidance range of $260-$270 million, analyst estimates have to come down somewhat.But key to realize is that with Groupon's stock sinking in tandem, its EV/EBITDA multiple is still attractive even with a lower EBITDA denominator. At the company's current market cap of $2.52 billion (as of the close of trading on February 16, at a share price of $4.51), Groupon carries an enterprise value of $1.83 billion, netting out its $880 million of cash and $190 million of convertible debt. That puts its EV/FY18 EBITDA valuation, using the $265 million guidance midpoint, at a modest 6.9x.Applying a 10x EBITDA multiple (which is still below market averages) yields a price target of $6.00, still a 30%-plus return from current levels. The point to be made here: though estimates are coming down, the price has come down even further. The interplay between the two suggests that Groupon has become more attractive, not less, at its new price. And that's not even taking into the account the fact that EBITDA (as well as all earnings metrics) can see a lot of variability, and with estimates so muted, Groupon has plenty of room for upside.Note also that Groupon looks attractive on a revenue multiple basis, with the stock currently trading at 0.7x EV/FY18 revenues:GRPN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsForget the EBITDA guidance and the slight earnings miss (pro forma EPS of $0.07 versus estimates of $0.09) - aren't we just glad Groupon was profitable on a GAAP basis, unlike most tech companies? And that it had been in a loss position last year, from which it rebounded despite a decline in revenues?This alone provides evidence that while Groupon isn't a be-everything-for-everyone company like Amazon, it has the capacity to be extremely profitable serving its small niche. And speaking of which, turning to the good news - Groupon grew its customer base in the quarter, defined as a user who made at least one purchase in the time period.Figure 1. Groupon customersSource: Groupon investor relationsTotal active customers grew 3% to 49.5 million. Of course, this is not the same kind of user growth that a company like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) or Snap (NYSE: SNAP) tends to see, but it's still respectable for an older internet company perceived as stagnant. Equally important to note is the fact that Groupon completed the exit of its countries largely in 1Q17, and on a y/y basis, Groupon managed to keep its international customer counts flat despite these exits that are impacting 4Q17 (and not so much 4Q16).Here's a look at the company's full results:Figure 2. Groupon Q4 resultsSource: Groupon investor relationsRevenue achievement of $873.2 million, while declining -3.5% in the quarter, massively beat out analyst expectations of $852.8 million. Two things to note here: this is a slower rate of decline than the -7.6% it saw last quarter, indicating that the bloodshed may soon come to a close. Also realize that the bulk of the revenue declines is centered on its Direct segment, which the company is intentionally pivoting away from because it's the lower-margin business of retailing goods for a markup.Accordingly, gross profit dollars - which is the company's primary top-line objective - grew despite the revenue decline. Gross profit in the quarter of $386.9 million grew 10% y/y. Given that it's gross profit - and not revenue - that ultimately flows to the bottom line, investors should be giving more credit to Groupon's gross profit growth than penalizing it for revenue declines.Note also as the company enters into FY18, easier comps will make its earnings look much more appealing, as the exited countries start ""disappearing"" from Groupon's results in early 2017.Cash flow was another highlight for Groupon. Yes, it's true that Groupon's full-year operating cash flow of $270.3 million is still lower than last year's $288.7 million. Netting out capex of $15.4 million, Groupon's free cash flow is $254.9 million - a respectable 9% margin of revenues, considering most other Internet companies are deeply negative in that regard.And again, all things must be taken in context of Groupon's price. It seems foolish for this company to be valued at an enterprise value of just 7.4x trailing FCF - again, one of the cheapest deals on the market.Groupon isn't just a peddler of vouchers and deals online - its stock itself is also a great deal at the moment, thanks to an ill-informed pullback that caused the stock to lose a lot of the gains it made in 2017.Unlike other struggling tech companies that try to re-invent themselves and end up spending themselves into the ground (like, say, GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO)), Groupon is comfortable with the knowledge that it's never going to be a superstar again, and is instead turning its focus to gross profit growth and conservative expansion of EBITDA and cash flow. The growth rate may not be stellar, but it can be had for a killer price.Don't let a single quarter's missed guidance color a well-reasoned investment decision. With so much negativity already, Groupon doesn't have high walls to cross on the earnings front, and looks well primed for a modest double-digit stock recovery in the coming year."
4156708,102875,2018-03-15T13:02:41-04:00,"Since beginning of the year, Groupon’s stock rating has been upgraded by a number of major investment banks.Our analysis shows that Groupon still has a small downside of around 20% from its current market price.We decided not to open any position in the company and wait for the upcoming earnings report to see if shorting the stock is worth the risk.","Since the beginning of 2014, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock has been constantly selling off, as the company failed to deliver growth and its assets were depreciating in value. However, with the relatively positive Q4 revenue results that were reported last month, investors are questioning whether Groupon stock has finally bottomed and has a potential to rebound, or should we expect more downside to come.Chart: Google FinanceOne of the main signs of recovery could be seen in the analysts' reports prepared by the big investment banks. In January, Goldman Sachs decided to change its recommendation on the company's stock from 'Sell' to 'Neutral' saying that its recent gross profit growth will lead to better EBITDA in 2018. In addition, a few days ago, Morgan Stanley also announced that they lifted Groupon to 'Neutral', as the company's cost saving measures making the business more efficient.To find out if the company is really recovering, we decided to make our own analysis. When valuing Groupon, our main goal was to find out how efficient the business will be in the foreseeable future, which is reflected in our discounted cash flow model, as we believe that in the upcoming years, the company will start to increase revenue on an annual basis. Thereby, our terminal growth rate in the model is 1%, which also aligns with Bloomberg estimates for the upcoming years.Source: Bloomberg, Own estimatesWeighted average cost of capital is 7.2%, where the cost of equity is 7.5% and the cost of debt is 4%, as the company has a small level of debt in comparison to its cash and cash equivalents. The tax rate in our model is only 21%, as the recent tax reform is going to benefit Groupon and other businesses in the foreseeable future. However, after discounting the terminal value, finding out enterprise value and making all the necessary calculations, our DCF model showed that Groupon's stock still has a downside of around 17% from the current market price.Source: Own estimatesFor the peer to peer analysis, we took the companies from the internet space, who make a profit and their businesses are based on the online marketplace model. After comparing Groupon to those companies, our comparable analysis showed that Groupon's stock still has a downside of around 30% from the market price.Source: Bloomberg, Own estimatesIn the end, we combined both of our analysis to create a realistic scenario and came to a conclusion that Groupon's final fair value is $3.70 per share, which represents an overall downside of around 20% from the today's price.Source: Own estimatesAs you could see, despite trading in a distressed territory, our analysis shows that Groupon shares still has more downside to its share price. However, even if the intrinsic value of Groupon is below the current price, the company still has a chance to increase in market value, as the positive analysts' coverage could be considered as an initial catalyst of growth that could create a momentum around its shares. Because of that, we decided not to open any position in the company and wait for the upcoming earnings report to see if shorting the stock is worth the risk, as the results in Q1 will show us if the company is really recovering or if the relatively positive results in Q4 were only a one-time thing."
4175699,103480,2018-05-20T13:52:27-04:00,"Groupon posted stellar Q1 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.Gross profit dollars, the company's main objective, grew 5% y/y even as revenues declined.The company also significantly raised its Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Low EBITDA guidance was what had sent the stock sinking last quarter.GRPN's flat performance in North America was counterbalanced by huge growth overseas.The company remains modestly valued against both revenues and EBITDA.","Groupon (GRPN), the online deals site, has just revealed strong Q1 results that investors seemingly don't know what to do with. The top-line beats and raised guidance initially caused the stock to pop by more than 10%, but these gains immediately pared down - since reporting earnings, Groupon is about flat and is also down -5% for the year-to-date period.GRPN data by YChartsThe stock certainly deserved the post-earnings rally that didn't last. Groupon's Q1 results revealed a company that is making progress toward all the objectives that investors wanted to see. Namely, the company continues to grow gross profit dollars. Groupon has shifted from chasing revenues to chasing the opportunities with the highest gross profit potential, and this gross profit focus will also lead to a long-term increase in profitability. On the cost side, Groupon continues to slim down its operating costs in an attempt to boost its adjusted EBITDA, its primary earnings metric.Last quarter, Groupon shares sank 10% after the company revealed FY18 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $260-270 million, representing modest 6% y/y growth at the midpoint. Now, the company has raised that target to $280-290 million, implying 14% y/y growth at the midpoint - an extremely significant guidance boost, as most companies only shift their guidance ranges by a few percentage points from quarter to quarter. It's true that Groupon's new guidance accounts for a $5-6 million contribution from the recently acquired Vouchercloud, but the fact that there's a lot of organic contribution baked into that guidance lift is also significant. And if we consider the fact that Groupon grew adjusted EBITDA by 17% in Q1, and if we note that some of the company's cost-cutting measures will kick in toward the back half of this year, we could even see higher adjusted EBITDA this year.This guidance lift also changes Groupon's valuation, which was already low to start. At its present stock price just under $5, Groupon is trading at a market cap of $2.73 billion. The company is also extremely cash-rich, with $855.3 million of cash and marketable securities on its most recent balance sheet. After subtracting out this cash and adding back $192.6 million of convertible notes, Groupon has an enterprise value of just $2.07 billion.Against the company's latest adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint, this represents a valuation of 7.5x EV/FY18 EBITDA. On a revenue multiple standpoint, Groupon also looks inexpensive trading under 1x forward revenues.GRPN EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsI continue to believe that Groupon is worth at least 10x EV/FY18 EBITDA, implying a price target of $6.25 and 29% upside from current levels. Nobody is under the illusion that Groupon will ever become a growth stock or a champion of the Internet sector again - but after the company's meteoric declines this year and last, the company has reasserted its curb appeal as a value stock.Here's a look at the company's results in the first quarter:Figure 1. Groupon Q1 earnings resultsSource: Groupon investor relationsTotal revenues declined -7% y/y to $626.5 million, outpacing a more modest -3.5% decline in Q4. However, this is to be expected - Groupon is now no longer managing the top line, it's completely focused on growing gross profit dollars. And in any case, analysts were only expecting $603.8 million in revenues, or a decline of -10% y/y.Gross profit dollars, meanwhile, grew 5% y/y to $324.9 million, signalling the company's focus on pursuing the highest gross margin opportunities. Mike Randolfi, the company's CFO, noted on the earnings call that the company's gross profit shift had ramped earlier in Q1 than expected:Key to recognize is that the international segment showed explosive 19% y/y gross profit growth (though on a constant-currency basis, growth was only 5%), while in the U.S., gross profit dollars declined by -1% y/y. Groupon is looking fairly saturated domestically, but its opportunities outside the U.S. are immense.Customer counts in the quarter also swung favorably for Groupon this quarter:Figure 2. Groupon active customersSource: Groupon investor relationsKey to note is that North America still added 1M (+3% y/y) active users despite the slowdown in gross profits this quarter, bringing total active customers to 49.6M (also up 3% y/y and keeping pace with the 3% y/y active customer growth Groupon saw in Q4).Note that just because Groupon's growth has slowed down to the single digits doesn't mean there aren't any growth opportunities in front of it. In addition to a renewed focus on the Local deals segment - a space with little overlap against the dominant e-commerce giants - Groupon's strategic partnership with GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) also kicked off this quarter, and will give Groupon customers the option to order delivery at over 80k restaurants.Groupon also continued to make progress on the cost front. Since 1Q17, the company has slashed its sales headcount by 8% y/y to end Q1 at ~2,400 sales employees. The company has also reduced its count of all other employees by 6% y/y to ~4,200.As a result, selling/general/administrative costs in the quarter dropped -4% y/y to $222.1 million. As the company moves past the restructuring phase and begins to fully take advantage of these cost reductions, it should see further boosts to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter already grew at a robust 17% y/y pace to $52.6 million, helped by the faster-than-expected gross profit ramps as well as the headcount trim:Figure 3. Groupon adjusted EBITDASource: Groupon investor relationsOn a pro forma basis, Groupon's EPS of $0.03 also beat analysts' expectations for breakeven ($0) EPS. It's also useful to note that analysts are expecting an average of $0.19 in EPS for the full year, as reported by Yahoo Finance, but with the beat this quarter and with the actual earnings having potential upside volatility, Groupon's forward P/E of ~25x looks fairly attractive as well. The fact that the company's income from continuing operations slimmed down to a loss of just -$2.8 million versus -$20.9 million in the prior Q1 is a hugely positive sign.This year has seemingly been the year of the turnaround stock in the internet sector, led by a resurgence in Twitter (TWTR) after it posted its first-ever GAAP profit in February and expects to yield full-year profitability in 2018 for the first time. While Groupon's story is a little bit different, the backbone is still the same - slower-growth company past its heyday, and now shifting its focus to yield higher margins and greater profitability.For a stock where expectations are already so low, Groupon's cheap valuations make it a compelling rebound play. Clearly there is some bullish fervor for the stock (we saw this briefly after Groupon's Q1 earnings pop) that just needs another catalyst to stick. Stay long on this name and buy while it's low."
4186332,22445,2018-07-10T09:37:00-04:00,"Groupon has been rumored to be for sale for a while now.
        Sources say executives and investment bankers intensified their efforts to find a buyer last month.
        At current levels Groupon shares are a good bet for short term gains.","I have to admit it, I have made good money with Groupon (GRPN) over the years, however not by buying and holding the stock. My investment theme has been to buy it at extremely depressed levels, and then simply to sell 50% to 100% higher down the road. Please note I always (and I mean always) took into consideration the charts, buying when my favorite technical indicator on a weekly scale told me to do so.At the same time however I was never a fan of the business. The company has never really made money (perhaps until recently), and revenue growth was never there. And because this is a market that likes revenue growth more than profits, there was never really a reason for me to hold the stock betting on its long term prospects. We all know the company has been up for sale for a while now. However what caught my eye was a post in recode that the effort had intensified last month. And since timing is very important, I thought it might be a good idea to look the stock over once more.To begin with, the market cap is about 1X revenue. While this does not say much by itself, it is a benchmark I use to make many decisions. And it has served my well trading GRPN.If you notice the chart below, if you bought the stock anytime below the blue line (where the market cap is below yearly revenue), you would have made easy money.So to begin with, I think if a buyer did emerge, he would pay more. How much more I don't know, however buying this market cap is very safe.The company has been profitable on an adjusted non-GAAP basis over the years. In fact from 2014 it has been profitable on an adjusted basis with the exception of 4 quarters, losing only $0.01 for each of those 4 quarters. sourceSo on average the company is not really losing money, it's simply not making much.The company has for the most part also been free cash flow positive. Over the last 4 quarters the company produced $83.7M i free cash flow (as per its Q1 results). However this is not a number then ever got me excited. And as a result of the free cash flow the company has been reducing its share count over the last 3 years. Which is a good thing. So it's not as if the company is in a detrimental position that it needs a buyer. It's simply not going anywhere (so far), and probably many shareholders are tired waiting for growth to appear and for the stock to appreciate and want to move on (my assumption). As a result it has put itself on the block for a while now.Who might be a buyer?This is almost impossible to tell. However we do know Alibaba (BABA) owns 5.6% of the company. Might BABA be interested? Well, BABA is trading at an insane 50 trailing P/E and 13X revenue. So yes it might be a buyer, because it's getting a bargain compared to what its own stock is trading at.However if BABA was a buyer, there would not be rumors that the company is trying to sell itself. There would be private discussions and no one would know anything, until the announcement came. So I don't BABA will be a buyer.Amazon (AMZN) several years ago was a major shareholder Living Social that was eventually acquired by GRPN. So I don't think AMZN would be interested either. So if the company is bought out, it could be anyone for any reason. And the fact that investment bankers are involved, reinforces this theory. Assuming a buyer emerges, what might he pay?This is almost impossible to answer also. The price can be anything, value is in the eye of the beholder. However if one looks around at what many high-tech companies are going for these days, then the bid price for GRPN might be a much higher.Like I said above the company is profitable on an adjusted basis. Over the past 4 quarters it has posted EPS of $0.13. So it's not like it's losing money. It's also not expensive as compared to BABA for example. Like I said above it is only trading at 1X revenue. Many say it's a horrible business model. I'm not sure of that. I actually think the company has potential. So whoever buys it (if a buyer emerges), will probably have some ideas on how to change things.So back to the price, this is my verdict. Since the company is profitable, the balance sheet is intact, produces free cash flow, and only trades at 1X revenue, I think the price might be considerable higher than today's market cap.Bottom line On my last article on GRPN I said I was not exited about the stock, but I would be willing to buy it, preferably around $3, as pure trade as I have done in the past. However to my surprise the stock has not fallen below $4 since then. So I have to assume it will probably not, and the current price is as good as it gets. As such, if you want to buy the stock for trading or speculation purposes, these levels are a good entry point. Lastly, irrespective at what levels the company might be bought at, the market will speculate the possibilities.As such, I am recommending taking a small position in the stock at current prices. One the one hand if there is a buyer I think it he will buy at much higher prices, and even if no buyer emerges, the temptation for speculation is too irresistible to pass on."

Just note the convertible arbitrage at the $5.40 strike price.","This article original appeared on Market Adventures on November 3, 2017. On September 1, 2017, I shared A New Long Idea. Within the piece, I made a recommendation for readers to buy Groupon (GRPN). At that time, shares were trading at $4.44. During the next few weeks, GRPN's stock meandered sideways and then started an upwards ascent. As GRPN shares pierced $5, the momentum took shares higher and they briefly touched the $5.34 level. However, the sell side, which has been consistently bearish on the name, had to throw a wet blanket on the rally and they had a downgrade party. Notably, before the market open on October 11th (when the stock was $4.99) my favorite sell-side shop - Goldman Sachs - initiated coverage with a ""sell"" rating. The timing appeared odd and I'm not sure why they suddenly launched coverage. If you think I'm a conspiracy theorist then please explain why Goldman Sachs' analyst was noticeably absent during last week's Q3 2017 call (here is the transcript).Therefore, it appears that the Goldman downgrade may have been aerial cover for its clients to cover their misguided short bet at a lesser loss. Note how short interest dropped by 2.5 million shares from September 29th - October 13th.

Here is my take on Q3 results. On a year-over-year basis, gross profits are vectoring in the right direction. Here are the highlights: As you can see, they raised the midpoint of guidance by $7.5 million. That's a good thing.

C) International Segment StrengthInternational platform technology improvements / catch upD) Projecting Multi-year adjusted EBITDA!GRPN's Q3 2017 was solid and raising guidance in the face of ample sell side skepticism/doubt usually leads to a higher stock price. The adjusted EBITDA guidance raise, growing free cash flow, and international segment progress are major positives. Moreover, if the market starts to view this business as a ""platform"" vs. coupon business, the valuation should expand. That said, be mindful that there is the convertible bond price overhang (which I covered in the original note). But given the business momentum, I don't think we can rule out $6 per share or possibly higher."
4132456,103480,2017-12-18T07:39:18-05:00,"Though Groupon is no longer growing its top line, it has massively boosted its gross profit dollars via more profitable sales.A recent restructuring has significantly cut down Groupon's overhead and improved its margin; the company has reached GAAP profitability and should continue to be profitable.With a market cap under $3 billion and ~$500 million in net cash, the company looks cheap trading at under 1x EV/Revenues and under 10x EV/Adj. EBITDA.Given that expectations are already so low for Groupon, as an ""older"" e-commerce company, Groupon has plenty of room to outperform.","Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), the local deals e-commerce site, has a story very similar to Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP). Both companies have more or less become forgotten and passed off as the larger stars of the Internet world - namely the FANG stocks - continue to post new highs. But while Groupon isn't growing as fast as it once did, and while its services have become relegated to a sort of ""niche"" play, the fact that Groupon is still maintaining (even better yet, slightly increasing) its active user base suggests that while Groupon will never explode the way Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has, its product is sticky within its end market.Management isn't chasing growth either, knowing that the company's addressable market has its limits. Rather, the company has lately been focused on growing gross profit dollars as well as eliminating overhead in efforts to hit profitability. Despite a contracting top line, Groupon has been able to massively cull its losses, and though the company has generated positive free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA for some time now, Groupon will also soon hit GAAP profitability on a full-year basis (after hitting GAAP profitability for the first time in 3Q17).In a market climate where tech stocks are racing to record highs, investors have begun to show signs of cooling enthusiasm on high-flying, loss-leading technology names. In recent weeks, newly minted IPOs have lost some ground and their revenue multiples have contracted somewhat. Investors are showing signs of rotation toward more value-oriented names in technology.Trading under 1x EV/FTM revenues, Groupon looks like an extreme value play. Of course, we have to note that Groupon's lower gross margin (slightly under 50%) makes an apples-to-apples comparison of its revenue multiple to other software and internet companies difficult, as these companies tend to have gross margins in the high 70s to low 90s. But even despite its lack of growth and lower margin, there's no reason Groupon's growing user base shouldn't merit it a revenue valuation of at least 1.25-1.50x.GRPN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGroupon has recovered in 2017 from 2016 lows, but given the market rotation toward value names, I believe its recovery will continue well into 2018. Groupon's earnings also provide a base for its valuation: assuming the company can grow adjusted EBITDA 20% y/y in FY18 to $300 million, I believe Groupon can hit a valuation of ~10x EV/FY18 adjusted EBITDA, implying a $6.50 price target and ~20% upside from current levels.In the ten years since Groupon's founding in 2008, the company's core business has remained largely unchanged. The company's web and mobile platforms are a gateway to local deals, with offers such as 40% off dining or tickets. The screenshot below shows Groupon's home page, with featured deals displayed:Groupon primarily sells its deals in the form of vouchers, which customers then redeem with third-party merchants. Groupon has revenue-sharing agreements with these merchants that gives the company a cut of these transactions.Groupon also has a Travel segment that gives customers access to deals on hotels and airfare, on which the company also earns a cut of revenues from third-party agencies.In addition to these third-party revenues, Groupon also features a ""Goods"" section that offers deals on merchandise, including electronics, accessories, and home goods. These Direct revenues represent approximately one-half of Groupon's revenue base, though at much lower gross margins (as Groupon purchases inventory and resells it at a markup). Third-party revenues, on the other hand, are nearly pure gross profit.With Groupon's three primary segments: Local, Travel, and Goods, the company is virtually a hybrid across all the major segments of e-commerce. Though the company isn't the top leader in any of these categories, its reputation for being an off-price vendor (deals like 60% off dining are nearly impossible to find anywhere but on Groupon) has ensured a loyal user following.As of the end of Q3, Groupon counted 49.1 million active customers (+7% y/y), defined as a user that has made at least one purchase in the trailing twelve months.Figure 1. Groupon user metricsSource: Groupon investor relationsIn the goal of chasing efficiency and profits, rather than blind growth, Groupon has deftly engaged in reduction efforts since mid-2014.The first wave of restructurings happened in mid-2015, centered around simplifying and reducing Groupon's global footprint. Much like Uber has recently found, operating everywhere in the world is not often the most sustainable business model, and it's likely best for the company to focus on the countries with the highest potential.At the end of 2014, Groupon was operating in 47 countries. Reduction efforts made through the end of 2016 sliced that number down to 24 countries. Cuts were complete by March 2017, discontinuing operations in low-performing countries such as Israel, Singapore, Russia, and Hong Kong and giving the company a total country count of 15. The company intends to highly focus on these fifteen countries, particularly pumping more marketing dollars into the U.S., which provides two-thirds of its revenue and a disproportionate amount of its profits.It's important to note that Groupon's decline in revenue is due, in large part, to the massive dispositions it's made since mid-2015 - not due to an exodus of users (as seen in the prior charts, Groupon's user base has actually grown). By heaving off its most unprofitable country subsidiaries, the company is making a conscious effort to cut its top line in order to boost margins.After its international slim-down, management turned its head next on U.S. operations, instituting a round of layoffs on corporate staff. The chart below, taken from Groupon's Q3 earnings deck, indicates that the company has shaved off nearly 10% in headcount and overhead expenses:Figure 2. Groupon workforce reduction resultsSource: Groupon Q3 earnings materialsThough layoffs are often a signal of poor underlying performance and are instituted in a ""reactive"" manner to troubling results - such as at Blue Apron (NASDAQ: APRN) - in Groupon's case, it rather seems that management is taking a proactive stance toward simplifying its organization structure and improving its margins.The chart below shows Groupon's results in the nine months year to date.Figure 3: Groupon YTD 2017 resultsSource: Groupon investor relationsRevenues have declined 15% y/y to $1.97 billion year to date - however, as previously mentioned, the bulk of the decline is due to Groupon's decision to divest operations in non-core countries. The decline has also begun to stem in the back half of the year, with revenues declining just 8% y/y in Q3 to $634.5 million.Given that 2017 presents ""easy comps"" for Groupon, this year served as a crucial reset for the company that 2018 can easily profit from.More than revenues, however, Groupon focuses on gross profit dollars and margins. In the third quarter, third-party gross profit grew to $260.5 million, representing a high 86% gross margin, and up 5% y/y from $249.0 million in 3Q16. It's worth noting that revenues in the third-party segment increased 7% y/y, shifting more of Groupon's revenue base toward third-party revenues and away from the lower-margin Direct sales.Total gross profit dollars in the year to date were $946.9 million (a 48% gross margin), up 2% y/y from $928.7 million in the prior-year period (a 44% gross margin). As Groupon's revenue mix continues to shift more toward its third-party fees, total gross margins should continue to inch higher.The effect of Groupon's successive restructuring becomes really evident in its decline in operating expenses. SG&A expenses are down to $677 million in the year-to-date period, representing overhead spending of 34% of total revenues, down from $756 million (36%) in the prior year. The company's workforce reduction efforts, detailed in the prior section, have sliced off ~$20 million in quarterly operating expenses.Accordingly, despite a declining top line, Groupon has inched closer to breakeven profitability. Net income in the year to date was -$22.5 million, nearly a fifth of losses of -$109.7 million in the prior year. And in the third quarter, GAAP net income turned positive (though just barely) for the first time, hitting $2.9 million (representing EPS of $0.01, beating analyst consensus of breakeven for Q3 by a penny).Groupon's adjusted earnings also give a good picture of the company's profitability expansion, as a large portion of its expenses lie in non-cash stock comp as well as depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 grew to $46.6 million, up 43% y/y - the table below shows the bridge from operating income to adjusted EBITDA:Figure 4. Groupon Adj. EBITDA walkdownOn a trailing twelve-month basis, Groupon has generated $225 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 33% y/y, and $99 million in free cash flow, up more than 3x. These strong profitability metrics speak to the fact that Groupon, in simplifying its business and reducing its global footprint, has actually become a sturdier, more profitable business despite sacrifices to the top line. Though the Street treats Groupon like a dying technology business, its headline revenue declines actually draw focus away from the fact that profits are expanding at rapid rates.Figure 5. Groupon TTM Adj. EBITDA and FCFSource: Groupon Q3 earnings materialsThe company is guiding to $225-$240 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 (+29% y/y), as well as $1.305-$1.355 billion in gross profit. As previously discussed, Groupon should be able to grow its adjusted EBITDA by at least 25% in FY18 (a conservative estimate, given the strong margin expansion trends this year), indicating an estimated adjusted EBITDA of ~$300 million. This places Groupon's current trading multiple at 8.4x EV/FY18 adjusted EBITDA - an extremely cheap multiple that, given continued profitability enhancements in 2018, should be able to notch up to 10x.Sentiment on Groupon has been mixed-to-negative for a long time, causing the stock to trade sideways for the past few years, with the beginnings of a recovery only showing in 2017. During that time, Groupon has greatly simplified its business and heaved off underperforming subsidiaries, allowing the company to achieve substantial profit growth despite declines in the top line.Groupon's shift toward GAAP profitability caused a stir in the markets during its Q3 earnings release, sending shares up 5% - as analysts hadn't expected Groupon to become profitable until Q4. Groupon's accelerated timeline for profitability will be a major bullish catalyst for the stock in 2018.The stock has been cooling off since its early November jump, so I might wait until shares consolidate further before initiating a position. Looking forward to 2018, however, Groupon looks likely to have an extended recovery toward prior trading levels, on the basis of a cheap revenue multiple under 1x forward revenues as well as cheap multiples of EBITDA and cash flow."
4143905,85726,2018-02-07T06:41:18-05:00,"The Super Bowl gives advertisers the opportunity to “make a splash.”.Two companies have recently caught my eye, each of which have potential Super Bowl ads, or could be affected by them.One is a hyper-growth story, another is a turnaround. Here's how to play them.","I’m not exactly sure that Super Bowl ads will really move the needle for the fate of any company, but the ads – which garner about $5 million per spot -- could potentially play a part in part of a larger narrative. Therefore, for those interested in consumer stocks with potential Super-Bowl-ad catalysts, two stand out to me that may have implications in the market: Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) and Pepsi (NYSE: PEP), which will have implications for my watchlist company National Beverage (Nasdaq: FIZZ).Groupon recently recruited Tiffany Haddish to be their official spokeswoman, after she went on Jimmy Kimmel Live! And told an amazing seven-minute story about going on A Groupon swamp tour with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-smith (her Girls Trip co-star). For those who don’t know Haddish, she stole the show during last year’s box office success Girls Trip. Girls Trip was a winner at the box office, grossing over $140 million on just a $20 million budget, and Haddish is widely known to have “stolen the show,” according to Rolling Stone and just about every other reviewer. If you’ll watch the movie, you’ll understand.Haddish also has a book out called “The Last Black Unicorn,” which is also being promoted heavily. I live in Los Angeles, and “The Last Black Unicorn” is being advertised on the side of the Laugh Factory, which is probably the most high-profile comedy club in LA, and therefore, the world. You can see a preview of the Super Bowl ad here.And Haddish’s Groupon love is authentic: According to the company, ""Tiffany ranks in the top 1 percent of most frequent Groupon purchasers and has literally saved thousands of dollars as a Groupon customer.""Of course, the endorsement wouldn’t mean as much unless there was something brewing at Groupon from a product perspective, and there is. Last year, the company unveiled Groupon+, which allows customers to link Groupon deals to any Visa (NYSE: V) or MasterCard (MA). The discount then comes via cash back on your credit card statement. The Visa partnership came earlier on in the year but the MasterCard deal didn’t come in until the end of the third quarter. With Visa/MasterCard the company claims Groupon+ could access 80% of the U.S. population potentially. Groupon+ removes two big pain points from using Groupon, which is pre-paying (and using before they expire), and then printing out/ bringing the coupons with you. That, potentially, could lead to a step-change in Groupon adoption and usage, although it remains to be seen. If it does, it could propel the stock back up significantly, as the company only trades at $3 billion, or 1x sales.Groupon+ was in 23 markets as of the end of the third quarter, but only well-advertised in three cities. In addition, the offering is really only for restaurants at the moment, with about 1500 restaurants having signed up for the Groupon+ offering. Management was very high on Plus though, and said businesses were increasingly signing up for the service at a higher rate than the core offerings, so the supply side of the equation at least seems healthy. In addition, management also believes Groupon+, while ideal for restaurants, could eventually be expanded to other categories – next up is likely health and beauty. Management noted there were about 1 million linked cards as ofQ3, compared with 32 million active members in the U.S., and another 17 million international (although Groupon+ isn’t available internationally yet).Groupon is also in the midst of some cross-currents that may potentially make it mispriced, despite having surged almost 60% in 2017. New CEO Rich Williams (who was the former CEO and also has experience at Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is only a little over 2 years on the job and still is implementing his turnaround plan. That includes streamlining the business down to its most profitable categories and geographies. For instance, Groupon has the cut the countries in which it operates from 47 down to 15. This has resulted in declining revenue (-7.6% last quarter) yet increasing gross profit (+5% last quarter) and adjusted EBITDA (+48%... though off a small base), and GAAP breakeven. The company also has a solid net cash position of around $300 million when considering the convertible notes and other long-term liabilities.While the stock has had a run, it is only valued around one times sales right now. Given the overall turnaround, the new Groupon+ feature, and the good fortune of catching Tiffany Haddish’s rising star, Groupon could be very interesting indeed. Q4 Earnings are also on February 14, and the story here may come into focus a bit more then. I have a small personal stake in the name and Groupon is on the watchlist for the Opportunity portfolio.One should also be on the lookout for a potential ad for a new sparkling water brand called Bubly, from Pepsico (NYSE: PEP). The entrance marks Pepsi’s (next) attempt to crack the growing sparkling water market, which it had attempted to enter with “Aquafina Sparkling Water” a few years ago. That doesn’t seem to have caught on, as National Beverage’s La Croix seems to be running away with the market, growing 60-70% last year (with the overall category growing about 13%).(UPDATE: I didn't see a Bubly ad -- I guess Pepsi chose not to splurge -- but it could still happen with the upcoming launch of the brand... Natioanal Beverage doesn't do traditional advertising anyway.)Recently it appears as though Pepsi is revamping its sparkling water with the new brand: The “U” in “Bubly,” looks like a smile, and it appears to come in a variety of flavors (like La Croix) and in light, playful packaging (also like La Croix).There are also a bunch of others entering the category – for instance, Kroger (NYSE: KR) just launched a “Simple Truth” branded- sparkling seltzer water. Simple Truth is the private-label “organic” brand at Kroger that the company is really pushing these days, as Simple Truth has become a $2 billion brand for the grocery chain.I tend to think that La Croix’s positioning as an authentic original brand should insulate it from competitors. Unless these new waters taste markedly different and better (which, I can’t imagine), I‘m not sure why one would switch sparkling water brands. La Croix has about 21 flavors, which keeps it relatively fresh, and its not like there is a huge cost difference in these brands, so I’m unsure if a new brand could disrupt La Croix’s momentum.However, I do think that perhaps, if Pepsi puts a big marketing push behind Bubly, there may be investor concern around La Croix and National Beverage’s stock, which is not exactly cheap. Should any competition-infused panic selling befall FIZZ’s stock, I may look to pounce for a compelling entry point. I have a small personal position in FIZZ, but it remains on the watchlist for the Opportunity Strategy.FIZZ is interesting as it only has three analysts covering it – the price targets are $40, $93, and… $173!!! That is a huge range and shows that pretty much no one has any idea how big La Croix could get. In addition, National Beverage’s quirky 81-year old CEO, who doesn’t do conference calls, and regularly releases eccentric press releases, also likely garners the ire of many investors. Honestly, the management situation would probably prevent me from taking a large “all-in” position in FIZZ, as much as I would want to. However, there is a sea-change going on in the soda industry, with the younger generation keenly away of the danger of sugar and artificial sweeteners and soda consumption declining for 12 straight years. La Croix was able to become a cult brand without any mass-marketing really, which makes it a real authentic brand that resonates with millennials. I don’t’ think there’s anything to stop young people from continuing to drink La Croix/ sparkling water in favor of soda for the rest of their lives. The question is whether La Croix can continue to “own” the category just as Coca Cola owned the soda industry for so many years, or whether La Croix will settle into a Coke/Pepsi duopoly with another brand – I think there is also room for that.In terms of National Beverage’s valuation, it is high – but so are the value for Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) at 22 times forward earnings, while FIZZ only trades at 26 times forward earnings. Coke is anticipating only mid-single digit case growth, meanwhile FIZZ is growing 20+% on the top-line and 35+% on the bottom line.The company doesn’t break out La Croix specifically, but some estimate La Croix may be roughly half of the company’s sales. That would put trailing 12-month sales at about $450 million. The company’s overall operating margin is about 21%, but that has been increasing over the years as La Croix picked up. Therefore, I let’s say La Croix carries with it a 25% operating margin, slightly below that of Coca Cola (25.6% -- though it should be noted Coke outsources almost all its bottling operations, whereas FIZZ is vertically-integrated). So, let’s say La Croix makes about $120 operating profit and therefore about $100 million in net profit, and that is going to grow 50% or so in the next year. National Beverage currently trades at an EV of less than $5 billion, which is only 33 times the forward figure of $150 in earnings. I would probably definitely pay 33x forward earnings for La Croix – and then you are getting the rest of the company and the brands Shasta, Faygo, and Everfresh, among others for free. This is obviously very back-of-the-napkin here, but a useful exercise. The company is not exactly detailed in its financial releases. That is of course, if La Croix can continue to become the iconic brand of the moment and continue the torrid pace of growth, and remain resilient to competitors. As A La Croix drinker myself, I happen to think it can.So, keep a lookout for a potential Bubly ad from Pepsi and the price action for National Beverage next week, and Tiffany Haddish’s Groupon ad ahead of Groupon’s Q4 earnings for evidence of a catalyst. A change in the narrative for either could yield a compelling entry point."
4122213,38631,2017-11-08T10:16:56-05:00,Groupon has rallied almost 20% during the last week and 80% during the last five months.The company is an a transitional model.It is also facing strong competition while its management is focusing on the wrong metrics.,"Groupon (GRPN) has rallied almost 20% during the last week thanks to its positive earnings report. As a result, it has now rallied 80% off the bottom it posted five months ago. Therefore, the big question is whether investors should attempt to jump into this rally or the rally has run its course.First of all, Groupon has a remarkable record of beating the analysts' estimates in earnings per share. To be sure, the company has exceeded the analysts' expectations in 9 consecutive quarters. In addition, it is in a transitional phase, as it has exited 32 out of the 47 countries it operated in until two years ago while it has also managed to stabilize its SG&A and marketing costs, which were on the rise until last year.Nevertheless, investors should not miss the fact that the company has failed to make a meaningful profit in every single year since its IPO. The major reason is the fierce competition, which has heated more than ever in the retail sector. Since Groupon decided to direct its business from daily deals to online sales of products, it now has to compete directly with Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT), which continuously improve the mix of price and delivery speed to their customers. In other words, Groupon has absolutely no moat in its business, as it competes with companies that have much greater financial strength. As a result, after the rapid international expansion that followed its IPO, the company has failed to grow profitably in the last three years.A major point of concern is the persistence of the management to focus on the gross profit, EBITDA and the number of members instead of focusing on the earnings. I have actually been impressed by the focus of the management on only these three metrics and the absence of any guidance regarding the earnings. Buffett has always advised investors to button their wallet whenever they see managements focusing on gross profit or EBITDA. The value of a company and its stock price are certainly determined by its earnings per share, not its gross profit or EBITDA. In fact, the focus on the wrong metrics clearly confirms that the business model of the company cannot make meaningful profits. That's why the stock has lost 80% since its IPO. If the metrics used by the management of Groupon were the ones that mattered, then the stock would have enjoyed a strong rally instead of plunging. Moreover, the focus of the management on the number of customers is reminiscent of the period of the tech bubble, when loss-making companies were focusing on the number of clicks they were attracting.It is also critical to note that Groupon recently changed its business model, from a coupon site to an extensive marketplace with numerous products. While that shift was obligatory for the survival of the company, investors should keep in mind that the company essentially changed field, from a niche market it had expertise in to a highly competitive retail market. When a company completely changes its business model after failing in its initial market, it waves an alarming red flag to investors because it no longer has the edge it had in the first place.It is also remarkable that the management of Groupon has rewarded itself with an excessive amount of shares in the last few years. More specifically, it rewarded itself with shares worth $472 M in the 4-year period 2013-2016 and thus offset about 60% of the share repurchases it executed during that period. As the company has failed to make a meaningful profit and its stock has collapsed since its IPO, it is certainly unacceptable that the management rewards itself in such an extreme way, at the expense of the shareholders.The share repurchases have also resulted in a markedly weak balance sheet. While the company had no debt until three years ago, its net debt (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities - cash - receivables) has now climbed to $524 M. Given that the company hardly makes any profit, this is obviously a negative development. Moreover, the share repurchases have caused the book value to fall towards zero. Therefore, if the company does not manage to turnaround, it will be greatly exposed to its creditors due to its weak balance sheet.To sum up, while the debt load of Groupon keeps growing and there are no meaningful earnings, its management continues to focus on its own metrics, i.e., the gross profit, EBITDA and the number of customers. At the same time, it is rewarding itself to the extreme via stock options. Therefore, the stock has too many red flags to be viewed as a long-term holding. Of course the stock may continue to rally in the short term or any time it spreads hopes for a turnaround but investors should view it only as a speculative, high-volatility, risky stock, which is not likely to have a happy end."
4128729,91605,2017-11-30T09:36:15-05:00,GRPN share price has increased 55% since July 31st.Management decision-making rewarded by market.Company is poised to seize emerging opportunity over the next 5-10 years.Millennials and Gen Z are key demographic moving forward.,"Groupon (GRPN), the sworn enemy of full priced goods and services everywhere, is a great tool for consumers, often saving them 40%-50% on meals, afternoons with the kids, or weekend trips. Groupon also provides value to companies big and small, growing exposure and driving customers to purchase products and services with special offers. They help consumers, small business, and the larger corporations, a true American tech sweetheart. And its share price is growing at a rapid clip. That’s all gravy. The real question here: is GRPN a sound long investment?A review of Groupon’s Quarter 3 earnings report reveals an important relationship between management decision making and increasing share prices. Managerial competence is an asset that does not show up on the balance sheet, but brings obvious value in the market. On July 31, Groupon and food delivery service Grubhub (GRUB) formed a strategic partnership that allows Groupon users place orders on Grubhub from Groupon, making use of Groupon’s offers and Grubhub’s robust delivery network. Since that date, the company has repurchased 2,384,200 shares. From the time of these decisions, GRPN share price has grown nearly 55%, from $3.76 to Tuesday’s close at $5.82. That rapid growth healthily outpaces the S&P index (SPX) that realized 6.3% growth in the same period. The technology sector, indexed by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) moved just over 12% in the positive since the 31st of July, from $57.61 to $64.71 in the 4-month span. Keep in mind, these large percentage gains coincide with smaller dollar gains than the aforementioned indices due to the low price of GRPN shares.The success of GRPN can be traced to successful management decisions in the latter half of 2017, most prominently the Grubhub partnership and share repurchase program, along with the overall success of the market at large. These are the newsworthy items, and there is always more to the story than the big splashes. Behind the high visibility decisions are subtleties that will contribute to continued Groupon success. While Q3 revenue fell 8% year over year, gross profit increased 6%, a discrepancy attributable to an 8%, or $19 million, decrease in SG&A expenditure from Q3 of 2016. Efforts to automate and streamline organizational structures that drove operational efficiency are beginning to realize quantifiable success. The company expects continue increasing efficiency into the foreseeable future. To enact the shift in emphasis to growth in gross profit measures as opposed to revenue, management is slowly tapering off Groupon’s presence in the Goods space, and focusing on Local markets, which they view as an opportunity that Groupon’s business model is molded to exploit. Revenues continue to decrease in the Goods market, while steadily strengthening in the Local market, a point I will touch upon again later.In Q3 of 2017, Groupon saw also the continuation of a 2017 trend in growth of North American active customers, defined by the company as unique user accounts that have made a purchase during the trailing twelve months, which has increased steadily in North America this year from 31.1 million in January to 32.5 million as of September. Active customers decreased internationally from roughly 16.7 million to 16.6 million, but showed growth from Q2 to Q3 of 2017. As Groupon expands their Local presence internationally as they have done in North America, expect increases in active customer numbers. The market has healthily rewarded GRPN share price for sound management strategy, mainly the shift in focus to gross profit at the expense of revenue, partnership with Grubhub, and a Q3 share repurchasing program that still holds $135 million of repurchasing power.The numbers above tell a story of a management team that is ready to adapt, and the rewards reaped from that very ability. Equally as important as strong financials and share price growth is the opportunity present in the market in which Groupon operates, and the outlook for its long-term success. We will first establish a snapshot of the Groupon demographic for the coming decade. As the last group of Millennials graduate college and begin their careers, there will be a notable rise in Millennial purchasing power. This is good news for Groupon. According to a 2015 emarketer survey, Millennials are the generation that use coupon websites and search engines to find coupons at the highest rates, 66% and 69%, respectively. Additionally, 45% of Millennials surveyed increased their use of paperless discounts from 2014. These results display the popularity of the services for which Groupon is the most recognizable brand name, among the generation set to experience the largest rise in purchasing power in the coming decade. This increased interest in coupons is due to the ease of accessing specific, personal coupons, and the overall debt ridden situation of the millennial prompting the emergence of a generational trait of thriftiness.I promised to come back to my argument for the importance Groupon’s shift of focus away from the Goods market and into the Local market. The foundation is set. Here it goes.My case hinges on the emerging consumer mindset of the Millennial, and of the increasingly relevant Generation Z, and how that mindset will affect future spending habits. The prevalence of technology in the development of Millennial and Gen Z psychology has a profound effect on consumer preference and buying patterns. The younger generations are turning from ownership to sharing-based systems, such as Uber and Airbnb. Another product of the technological age is an increased interest in physical well-being, most likely due to a subconscious anxiety triggered by the unceasing presence of cameras ready to snap a photo of us, combined with the multitudes of beautiful people reaping fame and fortune for nothing but their glowing picture appearing daily on millions of the timelines of the anatomical peasantry. Young people hit the gym more than past generations because they want to be ready for all those pictures, and to look like their favorite empty-headed insta-famous quasi-celebrities. Instagram will raise life expectancy purely through implicit body shaming, but that’s off topic. The last element of the Millennial consumer of note to this argument is the rise of experience-oriented culture and spending. There is an unspoken competition to post the best ‘experiences’. I see it on my phone every morning. Whether it be the Snapchat supremacists, the Instagram demagogues, and even the Facebook crew, everyone silently strives to outdo the rest. Observe the rise of the Selfie Stick, the GoPro, and ever intensifying focus on camera quality in smartphones. Caesar’s Entertainment (CZR) is planning to construct a zip line in Las Vegas to attract this new crowd of spenders. Young people want to post the best snaps and clips of their weekend vacation, trip abroad, or night out.So how does Groupon take advantage of all this Millennial madness? Simple pursuance of the strategy they have already begun to implement: ditch the goods, chase the local experiences. Local markets for Groupon are experience oriented, offering deals for local restaurants, beer tastings, winery tours, health & fitness programs, gym memberships, and a slew of other similar services. Increased emphasis on Local markets, both domestic and international, will key into that Millennial demographic with growing purchasing power and a thirst for these very offerings, demonstrated in the survey data detailed above. Deals for local gyms and fitness groups will find the most health conscious generation alive, all ready to try a new yoga class or save on a gym membership. Partnerships with local eateries, bars, tour and excursion groups, and even hotels could attract a thrifty generation that wants to share their experiences eating, drinking, and travelling more than any that came before them. When opportunity in the market meets a well-developed strategy to exploit it, the results will follow. Active customer growth will drive revenue, and at a lower cost in the Local market as opposed to the Goods market, further increasing gross profits. Share price will follow. And it will all happen with a generation poised to grow into the highest spending age group and maintain that position for a long time to come.Groupon share price continues to increase as 2017 nears conclusion, increases on the back of a competent management team. But past increases signal little about the direction of the future. Strong fundamentals, such as gross profit growth, provide a solid base. Due to a marketing emphasis on Local markets, shifting from Goods, Groupon has the opportunity to capture new customers and new revenue from an experience craving, health enthusiast, and thrifty Millennial generation as their purchasing power grows to the largest among any age group. Groupon is poised to grow, and exhibits the managerial strategy and adaptability to do so."
4115835,22445,2017-10-24T12:48:06-04:00,"Two buy recommendations and one sell.Sell Groupon because of profit talking.Buy GoPro because growth will accelerate.Buy Ceragon Networks because it's cheap, and might surprise.","Ceragon Networks (CRNT) will announce Q3'17 results on November 6. CRNT is a stock I have recommend in the past and performed well, however much to my surprise the stock has retreated, and now is even lower than when I first recommend it.One of the reasons for the decline, probably, has to do with the fact that analysts are not expecting revenue growth. Analysts are expecting revenue $327M for 2017 and $320 for 2018.However the company has made it clear it does not intend to pursue deals for the sake of adding revenue at a loss. As such, the company has been very choosy at picking projects, preferring profitability vs. revenue.So the question is, why should anyone buy CRNT, if very few expect any kind of growth in the future?The first reason is that this is a very cheap stock. CRNT is trading at a 10 P/E and 0.5X revenue. As such, all bad news is baked in the price of the stock. In other words, I see almost zero downside, unless something catastrophic is announced. Technically the stock has been hovering around $2 a share for a while. I do see several indicators looking bullish, however we will need something positive in order for the stock to move.Finally, buying any stock at rock-bottom prices leaves room for a positive surprise. This could be anything like an earnings surprise, better guidance or some kind of announcement pertaining to new contract win. Any one of the above will be enough to move this stock.Groupon (GRPN) is a stock I like a lot and have recommend it several times. For the most part, I have made good money buying and selling GRPN over the past several years.However, while the company has been getting its act together, it has not been able to grow by much. Analysts are forecasting EPS of $0.12 for 2017 and $0.16 for 2018. Also, revenue is expected to come in at $2.86B in 2017 and $2.93B in 2018.In other words, neither revenue growth or EPS is something that gets me excited at the $5 handle. Unless GRPN surprises the market on its Q3'17 conference call on November1, I do not think there is much upside to its stock (if any).One of the reasons I always liked GRPN was the reduction in the share float.So I will be listening very closely to hear what the company has to say about future share repurchases. To me, share repurchases are as important as earnings in the case of GRPN. This because both growth and EPS are weak, and I see share repurchases as a sort of compensation for weak growth.Also, I'm curios as to how the deal announced with GrubHub (GRUB) is going. Also, on a technical note the stock seems to be correcting. All my indicators point to short-term price pressure. I'm assuming the market is cashing in short-term profits and taking a wait and see attitude toward the stock.I have bought the stock back and further over the years. The last time I sold was above $5 and bought as low as $3 a share recently. This is not a bad profit for several months. My basis for buying on and off GRPN has been betting on a turnaround. And while the company has been doing ok, I can't say it's a ""wow.""So while I'm not negative on the company, I think talking profits at current levels is a wining proposition for those who bought at lower levels. GoPro (GPRO) also will announce Q3'17 results on November 1. Contrary to CRTN and GRPN, we know GPRO's results will be on the top range of management's previous guidance in the range between 290-$310 million and gross margins 36%-38%.I however think results might be better than guidance. Reason being, guidance was too early in the quarter. This means things might be better than guidance.GPRO forecasts it will be profitable in Q3 on a non-GAAP basis. And if I'm right as per my previous article, I also think the company will be profitable for the entire year.And with the company's new impressive product arsenal, not only will growth and profitability be achieved in 2017, but I think the company stands a good chance to achieve double-digit growth for 2018.Analysts are expecting revenue of $1.35B for 2017, an increase of 14% Y/Y, and revenue of $1.44B for 2018, which means growth of 6.3%. However I think these estimates might prove too conservative. Even if the above figures are confirmed and growth does not surprise the market, the company is on a clear path to growth and profitability.On a technical note, most indicators are bearish, however things are begging to become bullish. GPRO has corrected recently from the $12 handle. However I think we could see $12 again in the blink of an eye, if results are even slightly better than guidance. I for one think they will be, and are fully invested."
4101453,102757,2017-08-23T17:32:20-04:00,I review the key takeaways of the recently reported quarter.Turnaround seems to be at least partially working.Investors should track gross margins carefully.There is reason for cautious optimism.,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) turnaround seems to be at least partially working. The company's efforts in North America are starting to pay off while the International segment remains a drag. The metric to watch continues to be gross margin.In my earnings prediction, I stated that Groupon would beat earnings. Furthermore, I argued that given the price movement pre-earnings combined with post-earnings volatility, the stock was likely to rally:I wasn't entirely right on my predictions. Revenue came in below consensus while earnings came in above. My price movement estimate was, however, accurate. In any case, I'd like to talk about some of the developments and analyze some of the new information that we now have.One of the main themes of my previous article was the fact that management was extremely focused on improving gross margins. So much so that they stated they were willing to ""tolerate near-term revenue fluctuations so long as the changes we're making drive improvements in the long term gross profit performance.""In hindsight, I should have probably adjusted more for this fact when estimating revenue. Management is still focused on revenue since they reiterated this goal:There hasn't been much of a margin improvement if we look at the actual gross margin development on a short-term basis. According to management, gross profit per customer in North America remained flat at $30. This was despite adding 300,000 active customers in the quarter.The company reconciles the lack in gross margin growth with the fact that ""purchase behavior hasn't yet had time to fully mature."" To be sure, the sentence is referring to the purchase behavior of new customers. This is consistent with management stating that marketing efforts have a 12 to 18 months ROI period.Total active customers remained flat at 48 million, even though the company added 300k in active customers in North America. The reason for this is that the growth within North America had been completely offset by declines internationally.The development of the gross margin is similar to that of the flat growth in active customers in the sense that North America keeps improving while the international segment is a drag on results. North America gross profits grew by 8% year over year while the International segment declined slightly.The good news is that management expects ""this trajectory of double-digit North America Local gross profit growth to continue through the third quarter based on the strength we've seen through July.""Obviously, the turnaround thesis is based heavily on accelerating the North America margins while at the same time stopping the bleeding in the International segment. We can see that the North America segment is coming around nicely and that most issues are in the International segment.Management is a lot more optimistic about the opportunities in the International segment than I am. So much so that they have dubbed it a ""significant long-term opportunity."" Here's a quote from the 2Q17 transcript:Even so, the company deserves credit for the restructuring efforts. These restructuring efforts have also contributed to the decline in gross profits. While I am quick to point out the positives, I remain fairly reluctant to buy the ""significant opportunities."" After all, even though these opportunities may exist, the company has not been able to capitalize on them as of yet.All in all, I believe that Groupon continues to improve and that perhaps cautious optimism may be warranted. Cautious because on one hand, North America is doing fairly well while on the other hand, the International segment is currently a drag."

(GRPN), here at $4.44 per share. I have had GRPN on my radar screen for at least six months as I was impressed by a CNBC interview with its CEO a while back. Moreover, the technicals have definitively signaled a buy after forming a ""golden cross"" and now that its short interest is declining, I finally took the time to kick the qualitative tires.Source: Stockcharts.comSource: GuruFocus (I subsequently dropped in the most current short interest chart)I recently read GRPN Q2 2017 analyst call and was very pleased with the qualitative elements and have synthesized them. I would image that most of you have worked out from reading my work, I am really big on the qualitative art of trying to figure out a company as opposed to folks that mostly look at the numbers and ratios. As I have passionately argued, it is pretty hard to make money looking at ratios, especially these days, as that information is readily available and offered on numerous financial website.From a housekeeping standpoint, let's start with the valuation:As of June 30, 2017, Groupon has 556 million shares outstanding. They also have a $250 million 3.25% convertible bonds that mature on April 1, 2022. This bond converts into 46.295 million shares at a price of $5.40.So on a fully diluted basis, we are looking at roughly 602 million shares x $4.44 = a market capitalization of $2.675 billion.On April 4, 2016, the Company issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the ""Notes"") in a private placement to A-G Holdings, L.P. (""Atairos""). The net proceeds from this offering were $243.2 million after deducting issuance costs. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum, payable annually in arrears on April 1 of each year, which began on April 1, 2017. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2022, subject to earlier conversion or redemption.Each $1,000 of the principal amount of the Notes initially is convertible into 185.1852 shares of common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $5.40 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.Source: Groupon's Q2 2017 10-QNow let's discuss what I am excited about.Here is the link to the Q2 2017 conference call (here)Strength in North AmericaTrying to evolve the concept away from vouchersReached an agreement with Mastercard (MA) to enhance Groupon+Leveraging its strength in health and beauty - Beauty NowProgress cutting SG&A cuts and announced a deal with GrubhubThe Grubhub partnership could be key as Groupon, correctly in my view, realized that they didn't have resources, laser focus, or first mover advantage to successfully provide the Groupon food offering.

But if your goal is to make at least 50% (or more) from long calls made and held with the highest integrity and conviction, you can't simply follow the herd. You need to find out when everybody else is wrong, then invest against them. I'm the guy you want to do that with.

4093227,22445,2017-08-01T13:56:51-04:00,"The deal announced by Groupon and Grubhub is a win-win for both companies.However because Groupon is very undervalued in my mind, I think Groupon's stock will benefit more.In addition, this might be a preamble to a buyout of Groupon, that will probably happen at a substantial premium to today's price if it happens.","In a surprise move Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) and Grubhub (NYSE: GRUB) announced a strategic partnership to bring food delivery to Groupon customers throughout the United States. As part of the deal, Groupon and Grubhub have entered into a commercial agreement that will allow Groupon to provide users with the ability to order food delivery from Grubhub's 55,000 restaurant partners via the Groupon platform and is expected to enable people to redeem Groupon deals when they order Grubhub delivery via Groupon.Obviously this was a surprise, as these two companies are fierce competitors in the food deliver business. The question is, who will benefit from this deal, and who's stock will benefit most?To begin with let me say I follow both companies. I have had a buy and sell rating on GRPN on and off several times (link here), and I have always had a sell and short rating on GRUB (link here).The way I see it, GRPN is an extremely undervalued stock, and GRUB an inflated bubble (more on this below). So assuming the synergies will benefit both companies, by virtue of the fact that I think GRPN is undervalued, I think GRPN's stock will benefit more from this partnership.Another thing to keep in mind is while both companies offer food delivery (with GRUB being the leader in the space), GRUB is only a food deliver service and nothing else. GRPN on the other hand is a market-place company.GRPN's platform has the ability to offer many different types of deals across many different markets. GRUB's platform on the other hand is simply on order deliver system hooked up to thousand of restaurants and nothing else.As Maloney, CEO of GRUB said in the press release:So in my mind, GRUB probably needs GRPN more than GRPN needs GRUB. GRPN's platform will probably allow GRUP's restaurant customers to offer deals and special offers to a very wide customer base, which is not possible today with GRUB's platform.Now having said all this, this deal might be a preamble to a merger between the two companies. I the back of my mind, GRUB probably wants to see if GRPN's platform will benefit GRUB before it makes a move.Please note that if I were the CEO of GRUB, I too would want to use my very expensive stock price to try buyout another company that will complement my business.As a reminder, GRUB trades at a trailing Price/Sales ratio of 7.5 and a trailing P/E of about 71. Granted GRUB is forecasted to grow about 20% in 2018, however a forward P/E of about 37 is simply too rich for me.GRUB data by YChartsGRUB's stock has been up and down over the past 3 years because it is such an expensive stock. Please note revenue and profit growth is very strong, however that is already reflected in the stock's price and by a huge premium. In my opinion GRUB is still too rich and the price of the stock is still playing catch-up with revenue and profit growth.GRPN on the other hand has no trailing profits, however it trades at a Price/Sales of 0.7.GRPN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsAnd granted that GRPN is not growing by much, however I will bet my money on a company like GRPN that is trading below 1X sales and in the middle of a restructuring, than risk paying 37 a times forward multiple.And if such a merger or buyout were to happen, I doubt very much GRPN would be sold for less than $4 billion (or about 100% higher than where the stock stands today). At least if I were a major shareholder that would be my minimum price.So besides the synergies, there is a small chance that GRPN is bought out in the future, with GRPN shareholders doubling their money over the next several quarters or so.This is a win-win deal for both companies. However, because I think GRPN is a very undervalued company, I think GRPN's stock will benefit more than GRUB's stock.In addition, this might be a preamble to a buyout of GRPN, which might mean huge gains for today's GRPN shareholders."
4090003,103386,2017-07-24T18:45:13-04:00,"Currently trading around $3.65, Groupon is worth a look for a long-term, buy and hold investor.Lower expenses and strategic international growth will help drive stronger financials.Very little competition in the ""daily deals"" space.","It’s true: if you look at the historical price chart for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock since its IPO it does not paint a pretty picture:SourceAnd if you read some of the current commentary from analysts at Bank of America or Morgan Stanley, you wouldn’t think that anyone in their right mind would want to purchase Groupon stock (in fact, as of 7/21, none of the 18 analysts covering Groupon have it as a buy). The key rationale coming from the bears is that:This narrative makes a lot of sense, but may I remind you that most of these analysts are sell side. I would not recommend buying Groupon if you’re only planning on holding it for 1-2 years. But for a longer term investor who can stomach some mediocre growth in the short term, I believe at a price under $4.00 Groupon has enough upside potential to warrant stashing it into a portfolio.Here’s why:A New StrategyGroupon’s stock dropped nearly 25% in after hours trading after it was announced that Eric Lefkofsky would be stepping down and Rich Williams would be taking his place. When Williams took over the helm in late 2015 he clearly outlined a strategy to turn the company around:Turning a struggling company around can take time, and it isn’t easy (ask Marissa Meyer or Meg Whitman). But, in 2017, it finally appears that Williams' strategy is starting to yield results. Last quarter (Q2 2017), Groupon beat Wall Street expectations with revenue of $934.9 million (vs. $912.8 million consensus) and a EPS of $0.07 (vs. $0.02 consensus estimate.) In fact, Groupon has beat consensus estimates the last four quarters dating back to Q2 2016. Let’s look at each component of Williams’ strategy in more detail. Customer acquisition and retentionGroupon currently has 48.3 million active customers. One of the company’s earlier problems was churn. In addition to spending money on acquiring new customers, Williams has been smart to invest in other components that will retain current customers. For example, significant upgrades to the app have made for a better experience (No. 1 retail app on iOS and Android with 92% customer satisfaction), as well as investment in customer service staff so that there is little to no friction when users have issues or questions about a deal. Overall, Groupon reports that their “time to payback” for marketing is 12-18 months which isn’t great, but it’s not going to put them out of business, either. (source)Leaving non-accretive international marketsI believe this is one of the smartest moves Williams has made, but is also taking time. Thus, the financial impact has actually been negative so far as Groupon works to exit a number of countries. Groupon was spending far too much money opening up shop in low margin countries like Morocco and Thailand, ignoring the opportunity to build relationships with their customers in North America. It’s still early, but the results from Q1 2017 were positive: Groupon added 4.7M customers in North America in the last year (an 18% increase). (source) Gross profits in North America were up 2.3% year over year in Q1.Shift “Goods” category away from lower margin productsGroupon made a mistake trying to capitalize on products like electronics which have higher revenues but are much lower margin. There are already plenty of sites out there, namely Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), that sell discounted products. Groupon needs to continue focusing on local - it’s higher margin, they’ve already established relationships, and there’s not much competition (more on that later). Local gross billings in North America increased 9% year over year in Q1 2017.Decreasing Expenses and Decreasing CompetitionWhile Groupon is spending money on marketing and advertising, the company has been intentionally reducing expenses via headcount and other SG&A. Here are two slides from the Q1 earnings release that summarize:(Source)(Source)In addition to decreasing expenses, the competitive landscape is actually getting smaller, especially with Amazon exiting the “local deal” space. Since Groupon acquired LivingSocial (for basically nothing, by the way) last year, there really aren't any major competitors left. Of course, there's always the risk of a new company entering the space. But given the expense of customer acquisition, Groupon definitely has a first mover advantage that should be defensible.Putting It All TogetherI’m bullish on Groupon (for the long term) because I believe:If Groupon can continue to grow new customers in North America at 18%, they will have 5.55M. With an average gross billing of $123.00 (source), revenue from new customers would be $682.65. I believe the investments in customer service, mobile technologies, and building relationships with current customers should increase the average gross billing rate so the increase in revenue should be even more substantial. By the end of 2017 Groupon should have completed all of their country exits which will reduce financial noise. Finally, I believe Groupon stock should be able to weather any overall economic downturns as customers will likely be more adept to discounts/deals. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Do you believe even at under $4.00 Groupon is overvalued? Why or why not?"
4088543,102757,2017-07-18T18:05:13-04:00,I'm estimating Groupon to report $680.4 million in revenue versus Wall Street’s $670.3 million in revenue.This means that I expect Groupon to beat earnings estimates.Groupon's shares usually react very aggressively to beats or misses.This creates a significant profitable opportunities.,"Thesis  Groupon (GRPN) is poised for an earnings beat and given that the stock price has been depressed since last earnings, I view it as one of the better earnings plays of this season. This is particularly true if we acknowledge the volatility that typically accompanies Groupon’s earnings release.   Earnings release date: Aug 2, 2017, BMO IntroductionGroupon’s previous earnings report was ugly. The company beat on EPS but missed on revenue, sending the stock down by 12%. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to provide an earnings prediction on the previous quarter. The previous quarter was in stark contrast with 4Q16 where Groupon saw an earnings beat and the stock was up by 12% - 15%. At that time, I did manage to write an earnings prediction: “Why Groupon Will Very Likely Beat Earnings Estimate.”   Today I’m bringing you another earnings prediction. Also, I will make sure that Groupon’s earnings enjoy 100% coverage from now on since the stock's volatility ensures a good profit provided the direction has been estimated accurately.Typically, when stocks miss on earnings the valuation is adjusted downward. The logic here is that earnings expectations provide a basis for forward valuation. For example, if you consider a PE of 12x earnings to be expensive, you might deduce that stock A is actually cheap if its expected earnings is double that of last year. Therefore putting the “actual” PE at 6.   When a stock disappoints, valuations need to adjust downwards. You might have noticed that guidance cuts tend to produce one of the most vicious downward swings. This is because there is a far more precise number with which to re-adjust the valuation. Without a guidance cut, there is still some uncertainty and it is precisely that uncertainty that creates alpha –i.e. a positive risk-adjusted return.   Groupon did not issue a guidance cut. Investors are left to figure out for themselves if Groupon’s valuation should be adjusted downwards. As can be seen, by the stock price movement, the initial reaction was a complete knee-jerk reaction. Since then, the stock has recouped almost all of the lost gains and trades near the level of the 1Q17 earnings release.   However, it is obvious that market participants are skeptical about the feasibility of the guidance. This question on the latest conference call, from Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry, embodies that skepticism:  “And then given the inconsistency of demand that you saw in the first quarter, how do you get confident with maintaining your full-year guidance?”  Basically, the market is telling you it isn’t sure. The valuation post 1Q17 is too low, but the valuation post 4Q16 is too high. In effect, those who bought one day before 1Q17 earnings release and held until now would be approximately breakeven. Sometimes, an extensive valuation analysis is necessary to decide which valuation is appropriate. In this case, the market’s thinking is so obvious that it boils down to earnings.If the company’s earnings release reaffirms guidance –i.e. the numbers show that guidance is possible, we could see the stock move upwards sharply. The company does not break down guidance per quarter, which further complicates things. The company previously provided a full-year guidance of $200 million to $240 million in adjusted EBITDA. Further important guidance metrics were:  1) Revenue of roughly $2.9 billion 2) Gross profit of around $1.3 billion  Another important point is that management is extremely focused on improving gross margins. Management has even stated that it is willing to “tolerate near-term revenue fluctuations so long as the changes we're making drive improvements in the long term gross profit performance.”  Statements like this add to uncertainty and volatility around earnings, which is good if you have an estimate you’re confident about since the overall market is less efficient.There are some other moving parts here that will affect revenue and gross profits: “Put simply, we expect to see improved growth in North America local gross profit relative to Q1 and continued pressure in North America goods and international, all in line with our actions and focus on gross profit.In addition, we're significantly stepping up our Q2 marketing with investments in our offline campaign. As this marketing investment is likely to exceed our sequential SG&A reduction.”Let’s break this down so we can digest it better: 1) Growth in NA local gross profit, but pressure in NA goods and international 2) Increased marketing efforts to exceed SG&A reduction  To me, No. 1 sounds like management saying that the gross margin will not see any improvement. No. 2 sounds like management saying that the operating margin will face some short-term pressure.   To this, I would add that Groupon’s earnings are highly seasonal. In fact, the company burns cash throughout the first three quarters of the year before bringing in sizeable cash flow in the fourth quarter.   Also, we have to account for the fact that management sold out of some countries since 2Q16. All in all, I would not expect 2Q17 revenues to come in at more than 90% of 2Q16 revenues. In other words, I'm expecting a decline of 10%.   Remember, it is about the contrast between results and Wall Street expectations. Wall Street is expecting a decline of roughly 12%. In other words, I am estimating Groupon to report $680.4 million in revenue versus Wall Street’s $670.3 million in revenue. Therefore, Groupon will beat revenue expectations.Groupon is set for an earnings beat and a nice upswing to boot. I will be looking to open a position as the actual earnings date approaches.

4060271,102646,2017-04-04T16:41:54-04:00,"Groupon's market cap has moved from a high of $16 billion to $2 billion.Management is currently executing a turnaround.Though it might not reach its original valuation, I believe the company is a valuable investment.","In 2011, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) raised $700 million in its highly-anticipated IPO giving the company a market capitalization of $13 billion. The company ended the day trading at $28 a share and a market capitalization of $16 billion. At the time, this was the second biggest tech IPO in history. Five years later, the company’s stock price is trading at a $3.89, meaning its market cap has dropped to $2.1 billion. In this article, I will explain why I believe that Groupon is currently priced reasonably and set to grow in the coming years.Groupon is currently going through a turnaround strategy that management believe will compete with large e-commerce companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The turnaround process involves four strategies. First, management is focused on reducing its global footprint. This year, Groupon will be available in 15 countries, down from 47 in 2015. Second, the company has managed to ""reduce empty calories"" by removing low margin products and categories. Third, the company is improving its customer service experience. In the recent conference call, CEO Richard Williams said that they are now responding to messages 83 times faster than they initially did. Finally, the company is improving the number of active customers. In 2016, the company added 5 million new customers. This was the highest rate since 2012 as shown below.Source: StatistaGroupon’s turnaround will not be an easy one, and I expect it to take time. The company has shifted its original strategy from a daily deals site with limited products to an extensive marketplace with thousands of products sold by local merchants. The shift to the new strategy was appropriate because the daily deals concept was dying off. In 2015, Amazon shattered its Amazon Local platform that was a direct competitor to Groupon. In 2016, Groupon bought LivingSocial, a company once valued at $6 billion. The former Unicorn, Gilt Groupe, was also sold for $250 million.Therefore, the future of Groupon depends on how it adapts to the new strategy and whether its customers will follow it.Fortunately, the new strategy seems to be working although potential risks lie ahead. Over 60% of Groupon’s sales come from mobile. According to AppAnnie, Groupon’s Android and iOS apps rank as the 7th and 5th popular shopping apps in the respective stores. Its website is the 93rd most popular website in the United States. As shown below, most of the company’s web traffic comes from organic search followed by direct visitors.Source: SimilarWebIn 2016, the company had revenues of $3.14 billion compared to the $3.11 billion it had in 2015. Its net loss moved to $183 million from a profit of $33 million in the previous year. The company’s loss was attributed to an increase in marketing spending and its acquisition of LivingSocial. In 2016, Groupon spent $362 million in marketing which represented 6% of the total revenue. This was up from $254 million in 2015 or 4.1% of the total revenue. This year, the company expects to spend a similar amount in marketing to attract new customers.Presently, Groupon faces three major challenges. First, it faces the challenge of customer acquisition costs. In the current model, Groupon must continue to advertise its products and services in a more aggressive manner. However, in 2016, the company’s percentage of marketing expenses, compared to revenue, is relatively lower than that of other e-commerce companies. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Wayfair (NYSE:W), and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) share of marketing to revenue is 26.3%, 23%, and 11.1%, respectively. This gives Groupon room to increase its marketing spend in future.The second challenge that Groupon must deal with is competition. The e-commerce field has grown significantly with bigger companies such as Amazon and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) competing for a market share. The two companies have increased discounts and increased the speed of delivery. Amazon’s Prime service gives people a chance to pay an annual fee of $100 and receive free shipping on select products. This is bundled with other services such as music, movies, and TV shows, and free unlimited photo storage among others. While Groupon’s focus is on local commerce, it must now contend with the fact that it will continue to compete with companies with more resources who are targeting the same customers.Third, the company faces the challenge of growth now that the company is reducing its global footprint. Also, its revenue is not growing as fast as it used to. However, I believe the company’s strategy to cut its global footprint is ideal because it is only its exiting markets that have proven to be unprofitable. Now, as it shifts focus to its profitable segments, I expect the company to accelerate growth and reduce wasted efforts.In terms of valuation, Groupon has a market cap of $2.1 billion. Its stock price is currently trading at $3.89. In the past one year, the stock has traded between a low of $2.92 and $5.94. The company’s trailing price-to-sales ratio of 0.722 is significantly lower than that of its peer companies. For Groupon’s peers, I am considering eBay, RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE), and Wayfair which have a trailing P/S ratio of 4.3, 1.42, and 1.04, respectively.This year, analysts expect the company to make between $2.95 billion and $3.25 billion. The average consensus revenue for the company is $3.14 billion. Using these estimates, the company has a forward P/S ratio of 0.67, which is also lower than its peers, which have 3.67, 1.62, and 0.68, respectively.ConclusionGroupon might not get to its earlier valuation any time soon. However, I believe that the company’s management is putting in the right measures to achieve a successful turnaround. By exiting unsustainable markets, moving from the daily deals model, and reducing the empty calories, the company will be at a good place to improve its margins. As with most turnarounds, this process will take time and the company will make mistakes along the way. At the current price, I believe the company is a buy, but only for investors willing hold for a few years."
4099914,87516,2017-08-17T16:13:43-04:00,Transition in progress for Groupon from a daily deal website to a daily habit e-commerce platform.Positive mix development into higher margin local deals early signs of turnaround.Sufficient liquidity available to enhance the platform and drive growth through more marketing spent.,"Everyone likes to do, get, or make a good deal. Either by edging out the market, your peer group, or by clinching an asset or experience where the price you pay is sufficiently low that value can be instantly appreciated. Get your nails nicely clipped (if you were actually going to this kind of saloon), or buy an iPhone plug (take the real one otherwise it will stop operating after a few weeks). Groupon (GRPN) is at the centre of animal spirits. Also, once the fastest company ever to reach $1bn in sales, the company has fallen from its darling status due to some zealous misrepresentations in its IPO filing and its former CEO/Founder leaving. This paves the way for a good write-up.I will argue in this short note that putting some money at work in Groupon is not a bad idea if you can pick your timing right: capitalizing on turnaround efforts, maximizing probability as an acquisition target / commercial partnership play and operating performance.In essence, Groupon brings together supply and demand. It allows mostly small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to market their service or product to a large pool of potential clients. Reducing marketing costs in cases where client acquisition costs are high, or to optimize utilization of their services that are structured on a (semi) fixed operating expense base.The daily deal business that is the origin of Groupon's model worked because some merchants could generate lots of traffic and market their business in a different way, fill their underutilized franchise and get some additional cross-sell in their business. Groupon grew too quickly with proliferation in many international markets that all required local expertise and commitment. Also, the realization kicked in that doing a good deal only now and then is not a viable long term business model. Being a daily habit in local commerce is.What I like most about Groupon is that it creates tangible benefits for both the merchants on the supply side as well as for clients on the demand side. For a quick snapshot of Groupon, see the enclosed fact sheet as per 2Q2017 of the company2Q2017 Groupon Fact SheetThe new Groupon leadership team acknowledges that their model needs to improve in terms of customer experience, merchant traction and getting beyond the daily deal proposition to a daily habit platform. Compare it with an unsolved Rubiks cube, there is a combination you just need to get the moves right. Rich Williams and Mike Randolfi are pursuing the daily habit in local commerce strategy that hinges on the following value levers:(1) accelerating customer purchase frequency(2) seamless engagement for customer and merchant(3) driving customer growthIn order to focus on this, Groupon's footprint will also be reduced from 26 countries (as per 3Q2016) to 15 core countries going forward, which include the United States, Canada, most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, and make substantive efficiency steps in the operating expense base.(1) Customer purchase frequencyGroupon has 48.3m active clients as per 2Q2017 (defined as clients that made 1 purchase in the last twelve month, hence I am a client). An active client makes about ~4-5 purchases a year, or once every quarter or so. Getting these clients to increase their frequency, is the magic ingredient to unlock significant value going forward.Customers may want to hunt for a great deal every now and then, however, they buy much more if Groupon is an utility-like platform that can be used in everyday life and for everyday needs.(2) Seamless engagementWhen you go to a restaurant on a date you don't like to pay by showing a clumsy printed coupon that has the word discount written all over it. Discretion is the key to success here, and clients are only likely to be indiscrete (and buy from Groupon) if the discount is outrageously good that style is subordinate to the deal. Truth is that style is important. Groupon is pretty outspoken to go voucher-less and weaving the coupon automatically into the payment mechanism, for example, in their recent partnership with Mastercard. Part of becoming a daily habit is to have a great product or platform, these are some of the right moves in my view.(3) Customer growthOverall active customer growth has been positive over the last 6 quarters, from 44.2m as per 1Q2016 to 48.3m clients as per 2Q2017. Its marketing spent is ~15% of revenues in 2Q2017 with sticking to a hurdle rate of 12-18 months payback in gross profit of all $ marketing spend and order discounts it gives to clients (~$56m in 2Q2017).Also extending the concept of customer growth is the partnerships Groupon is forming, for example, the one recently announced with Grubhub in food delivery.On mobile, Groupon has its app downloaded 157m times. That is pretty decent. Being the best rated mobile app in retail in 2016 (by Applause) should not be an impediment to drive more growth.Groupon's gross profit for the local segment (the local commerce service business) measured on total billings is >2x the goods segment both in North America as well as in the international business. As depicted below, the gross billings mix is gradually steered into the local segment which I see as a positive, with the goods business' future being a great support role. All of the above initiatives should eventually flow to the bottom line. Looking at the financials currently to get into the stock is still a leap of faith. Negative earnings of $34m in 1H2017 and in each full year since its inception, Groupon has made a loss. Its market cap of $2.2bn and book value of equity at $186m (take out the goodwill and intangible assets and you get a negative tangible book equity of $(129)m), is not my preferred balance sheet position in a turnaround situation.What I do like is the negative working capital that allows Groupon to grow its business in an efficient manner. This is mostly captured in the line 'accrued merchant and supplier payables' ($606m as per 2Q2017) that allow Groupon to get paid by its clients first before transferring payments to its merchants. The cash balance of $619m as per 2Q2017 is therefore indeed largely consummated by a current liability in Groupon's business model.In 2016, Groupon had operating cash flow of $117m with cash flows from investing activities of $(69)m. Although this is not creating a sufficient safety margin, the reason why the cash balance has been deteriorating from $853m at year end 2015 to $619m as per 2Q2017. It is largely the cash outflows to support its share buyback program. Besides, the Company has an undrawn credit arrangement of $250m as a buffer or source for any investments (matures in July 2019).Any valuation of Groupon is going to be wildly scientific and totally inaccurate. Since the company's IPO in November 2011, it has been a bumpy ride down from ~$26 per share then to ~$4 per share now.The strength of Groupon is the local commerce angle, this is the uniqueness of the model that makes the platform potentially very sticky. Besides the ongoing operational execution that is in play, there are a few avenues available for Groupon. It could add functionality to its platform that uses geolocations and preferences so it can pop up when you are on the go to trigger potential purchases, e.g. Groupon as a map that also draws out the experience location (rather than focusing on the goods page). Also, when dealing with local commerce, a merchant review component embedded for clients can enrich the customer experience (e.g. Yelp), or having other institutional links to merchants to get a deeper inventory base or making merchants more successful (e.g. Hibu/Yell) can be a great value addition.As a token of faith in Groupon, I have purchased an i-phone charger (and previously a set of t-shirts) prior to writing this note. Likely, I will put a toe in the water on the stock and accumulate further if in the following quarters the operating metrics are showing a sustained pendulum towards the transition to a daily habits commerce platform. There is a reasonable chance that a potential tie-up with another player could make sense to tap into wider or richer profit pool, either as a M&A exit or in a more commercial partnership form. Animal spirits are against the share price of Groupon currently. If the company can spiral into positive earnings and improve client purchase frequency, the herd can start running in another direction."
4069709,102225,2017-05-05T13:12:00-04:00,"The North America segment has been posting good growth in gross profits but it's being overshadowed by the International segment.Groupon Goods is slowly and steadily becoming an online marketplace that might challenge well-established online retailers in the future.Groupon contains a desirable customer base that could be monetized by promoted advertisements for vacations, merchandise, or local and national businesses.At the current valuation, shorting the stock might not be the best course of action.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) went public in late 2011 and since then has lost more than 80% of its stock price valuation. Needless to say, this is a hated company by many in Wall Street and Main Street. You can find many articles that provide details of the company's past five years anywhere on the web. However, I will not focus on the past. Instead, I'll discuss where I see Groupon heading in the next couple of months as what used to be the fastest company to reach a billion-dollar valuation focuses on gross profit growth rather than revenue growth. No longer will Groupon focus on how many countries it has entered, but rather how profitable each country it currently operates in improves its bottom line. Almost 50 millions shorts believe these strategic initiatives and smaller international focus will not materialize, but I believe that shorts' victories over the past five years might be coming to a halt as slowly, but surely, Groupon's North America's stable performance will become more evident as it will no longer be overshadowed by international business exits by Groupon.BUSINESS SEGMENTSGroupon is compromised of Local, Goods, and Travel business segments.Local deals can be divided into voucher and voucherless deals. Voucher deals require you show the merchant either a print out or mobile voucher in order for them to honor the discounted service price. Groupon's local deals mostly focus on food, services, and experiences. Restaurants and beauty services, which include haircuts, nails and cosmetics, are among the largest segments in local deals as the Groupon demographics tend to skew towards middle-aged women with house hold incomes of $100k+.Voucherless deals don't require the user to show any print outs or mobile vouchers to the local businesses. All that is required is for you to have a Visa (NYSE:V) credit card linked to your Groupon app. From there, you just look in the app for voucherless deals, click ""claim"" on the local offer you prefer, and then visit the establishment. It's that simple. I hope Groupon places greater emphasis on voucherless deals, and I'm happy to hear Rich Williams reinforce this during the last quarterly call.One negative aspect of Groupon restaurant deals has always been the perception. In the past, I've seen hesitation from customers and restaurants to use Groupon for their dining experiences. On the restaurant side, the staff complained of lower tips as many Groupon customers tipped on the after-discount amount rather than the full price of their meal. On the customer side, there were instances that mentioned biased service from restaurant staff once they knew the customer was dining on a Groupon deal. With voucherless deals, both of these complaints are eliminated as the only thing the customer has to provide is their Visa credit card linked to Groupon's app. Customers don't need to mention anything and will still tip on the full amount as no discount is displayed on the receipt. The customer receives back her or his ""cash-back"" as a refund in their credit card statement a few days after the transaction took place. I personally think cash-back deals are the future of coupons in retail, and Groupon's voucherless deals provide a great option for geolocation marketing by local, and possibly in the future, national merchants. Investors should pay close attention when Groupon begins implementing voucherless deals on vendors other than restaurants as I believe this will allow Groupon to streamline their processes and reduce costs, unlocking value for their merchants and users.Voucherless deals increase credit card usage and this is something that Visa has recognized and is probably the primary reason they partnered with Groupon. Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and others have not signed up with Groupon but since ""Visa is covering 70%-plus of cardholder"" according to Rich Williams during the latest quarterly call, it should provide great opportunity in the short term with the ability to implement at a larger scale in the long term with more partners.Within their local deals, Groupon also recently began offering food delivery and takeout. Their food delivery option is an important business segment for Groupon as it makes customers access the app more frequently and in the process hopefully create an opportunity for Groupon to generate an additional transaction in products other than food. However, there is not much differentiation between what Groupon offers and what other apps that provide delivery already do. I would be very interested in this segment if Groupon began experimenting with the restaurants and creates a tailored ""Groupon Menu"" option that is discounted relative to other food items. This could allow for restaurants to plan ahead their inventory while also slightly differentiating Groupon from other competitors. Additionally, Groupon could also implement a rewards program for their users that would reward users by the number of times she or he orders delivery or takeout. This program could benefit delivery and takeout merchants with increased sales and Groupon with increased usage in its app, which again provides the opportunity to sell additional products to its users.GOODSGroupon Goods is a marketplace where Groupon can sell products in two ways. In first option, Groupon can sell products to its users directly, where Groupon acts as the merchant. The other option is where Groupon acts as a liaison between the merchant and users, essentially acting like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in a much smaller scale. Groupon Goods is often controversial between analysts as it has lower gross margins compared to local deals. Regardless of the lower margins I believe Groupon is doing the right thing by still focusing on Goods. It's something that could potentially become much larger, and it also increases usage among its users and more importantly allows Groupon to learn the likes and dislikes of its users. From there, hopefully better targeted local deals can be offered to its consumer base. Groupon Goods also takes the stigma from Groupon being a one-trick pony that only sells coupons, which in my opinion is a misconception that needs be eliminated from the mindset of Groupon's users and investors.TRAVELGroupon Travel is a segment where Groupon offers discounted travel deals for flights and hotels nationally and internationally. Traveling is an experience that some millennials value over material possessions according to recent studies. Groupon can add value to its users by having group deals with current and new users. This segment also gives Groupon the ability to potentially sell advertisements to Groupon users. Most of the states in the U.S. and other countries have tourism budgets that sometimes reach well over $50M. Thus, giving states ample resources to advertise through various formats. Groupon could be one of those formats. These advertisement efforts will be something I will discuss in more details below.CURRENT STATEMost of the segments described above operate in both the North American and International markets. Below you can see a snapshot of Groupon's active users in past 17 quarters. One can immediately see that the International users are decreasing from 2014 when they used to compromise most of Groupon's users. It should be alarming, but if we look at North America's growth you can see 2015 Q1 is the first quarter where North America finally becomes the largest user base for Groupon and continues to do so to this date. International user declines are due to the planned business exits that were mostly unprofitable and distracted Groupon's staff from the markets where greater potential for improvements lie ahead.Source: Groupon's Financial StatementsAs soon as Groupon began spending more time to focus on improvements in North America, gross margins improved as well. Below you can see the trend for North America gross margins for the trailing 12 months as well as the North American gross margins for the Groupon Goods category.Source: Groupon's Financial StatementsSource: Groupon's Financial StatementsBoth of the charts above do not paint a negative picture and to the contrary show improving margins that will likely offset the decreases in revenue that management has planned to instead focus in gross margins.North America Groupon managed to make $473M in revenue in 2017 Q1 compared to $501M in revenue in 2016 Q1. One thing we need to consider is that in 2017 Q1 there was a main focus on International business exits, but for the sake of argument, let's analyze it as if it didn't cause any distractions to Groupon's management. This should point to a negative picture. But if we look closer we can see that even with that decreased revenue, North America Groupon had $221M in gross profits for 2017 Q1. In the past 17 quarters, only one time has North America Groupon had a higher gross profit than the current quarter, and that was during 2016 Q4 during what typically is the biggest revenue-generating quarters in retail in the United States. Even the fourth quarters in 2013, 2014 and 2015 didn't surpass the gross profits of 2017 Q1. That should give you a clearer picture of why a lower focus on revenue growth could still prove beneficial to Groupon if they continue to focus in gross profits instead.Source: Groupon's Financial StatementsRECOMMENDATIONSI think the Groupon app has improved greatly from its first iterations, but there's still room for improvement. In the IoS app, I think that Groupon should squeeze more than one and half merchants in a single page. I'm aware that this will reduce the picture sizes but that can be remedied when the users click the deal that interest her or him, which would have a regular sized picture. The second landing page could also have even more relevant products or services at the bottom of the page. By increasing the numbers of merchants visible in one single page, Groupon is reducing the number of scrolls for its users while also presenting more deals in a shorter amount of time that might convert to a sale for Groupon. This action also allows to free up app real estate that will be used for advertisements.Before the restructuring took place, Groupon should have found ways to add some additional revenue by advertising national brands with big marketing budgets in its app. Groupon Goods could have taken the same approach Amazon currently takes with its sponsored results when searching for specific items. I think the CPM rates should be favorable for Groupon's app since users are using the app to buy a product or service. By tailoring each advertisement to each user, Groupon could realize a good revenue stream as thousands of eyeballs look through the Groupon app or website in each city every day. I understand that Groupon wants to serve the Small and Medium Sized Businesses (""SMBs"") but under these restructuring conditions and with stock prices at almost all-time lows, Groupon needs to provide some relief to stockholders. Long-term investors of Groupon need to be re-assured by Groupon and excited with upcoming pipeline operation improvements. By adding this form of revenue stream that could easily be rolled back, Groupon could do just that. Let's not forget that Groupon's Board of Directors include Michael Angelakis, a former CFO of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and who also oversaw a private equity firm's investments in technology, media, and communication companies. In addition, another member recently added is Joey Levin who ""brings strong perspective in consumer technology as well as deep strategic marketing experience."" Joey Levin is currently the CEO of IAC (NASDAQ:IAC).Under this leadership, Groupon should have the expertise required to implement advertisements to generate revenues swiftly, should they choose to do so.Lastly, I've recently noticed that Groupon is trading at 10X adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months which is very similar to the multiple of RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) when it was recently acquired by Harland Clarke for $630M.For people expecting Groupon to go lower in price resulting in a lower adjusted EBITDA multiple below of RetailMeNot's 10X should ask themselves if comparing Groupon, which compromises Good, Local, Travel, Food Delivery, and Coupons to a company that was slightly more profitable in a smaller scale and mostly focused in coupons and gift cards is a wise decision.I'll close with a snapshot of the most popular shopping apps in the United States as of February 2017. Below you can see how Groupon compares to others should you choose to value Groupon to RetailMeNot.Source: StatistaHopefully I have provided a better picture of where Groupon currently stands and where it could be headed. I will attempt to also look at international trends in the future. But due to the large numbers of closures it is somewhat more difficult and time consuming.

You can find them here and here. I have since been on vacation and haven't paid much attention to the company till an ad today in my email inbox brought me back to this name. In this article, I will share some parting thoughts before I close out my position.First of all, if you followed me through my previous articles, you know that I had not hedged my profits before the Q4 earnings announcements. I never understood why bulls took the results as a vindication of the bull case, but nevertheless the stock rallied over 22% on the day - so congratulations to everyone who was long the stock through earnings.Fast forward a month though and the stock is now heading back below $4 per share. Barclays also recently went underweight the name with a target of $3.60. So what should you do here if you are invested?Keeping the growth story aliveHere is the ad that brought me back to this name.Just in time to close out the quarter, you can now get stuff at a 100% discount! It is not a small amount either, they are allowing you to make any purchase up to $30 dollars on what would be considered a ""local"" deal.I can understand promotions when a company is starting out trying to build a brand. However, when you are having to make your services available for free 6 years after establishing a nationwide presence in order to attract customers, something does not look right. Could it just be that the story Groupon has been selling the past few quarters has been of growth and traction in the US market and it has a lot to lose if this narrative breaks down?The story of buybacksThis brings me to one final topic I want to cover - Buybacks. I have always been baffled by why a money-losing company would want to buy back their stock. So let's go over some of the typical reasons companies buy back stock and see if any of these apply to Groupon.Concluding ThoughtsI have written a few articles now on Groupon highlighting some of the red flags. I encourage you to read them whether you are long or short the stock. As for me, I have been short the stock since before last year's Q3 earnings and while it has had a significant percentage return, my small position has meant it is not much profit in dollar terms. Unless something very interesting happens in the name, I do not expect to cover it going forward. I will be closing my position before the end of April. The volatility in the name is keeping me away from taking a larger stake. Good luck with your trade/investments in Groupon, long or short.Supporting Documents"
4045565,102757,2017-02-13T21:36:57-05:00,Groupon is expected to report a year-over-year increase from when the revenue stood at $914 million.Seasonality will drive higher revenue.The LivingSocial acquisition as well as offline marketing efforts put my revenue estimate at $975 versus the consensus estimate of $942.The company's increasing margins instill in me the belief that it will report $0.04 earnings per share instead of the $0.03 Wall Street consensus.,"ThesisGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a company that has given many investors a headache. It is a classic turnaround stock that promises huge upside potential, if only management can turn it around. While I do not intend to invest in Groupon for the long term, I am among those that the company is giving a headache. As I work to estimate what numbers will be reported in the upcoming earnings report, I notice a few things that I feel investors should be alerted to: the significant use and difference between non-GAAP and GAAP, and the high stock-based compensation. After some harsh words on the accounting practices and compensation, I conclude that the company is very likely to beat the earnings estimate.RevenueGroupon is guiding for an annual revenue of $3,075-5,150 million, which would translate into a sequential revenue increase of 20-31%. In other words, the company is expecting 4Q16 revenue to be $867-942 million. This seems like an unlikely increase in revenue, especially since the highest figure in the last three quarters was $756 million (2Q16). The increase can be easily explained. Some of this difference can be attributed to the acquisition of LivingSocial. Company CFO Michael O. Randolfi had this to say about the acquisition and its contribution:So LivingSocial is expected to contribute $15 million. Another development that is driving revenues is the company's operations in North America. This segment grew by 10%The second thing to consider is that the company avoided ""expensive and inefficient off-line media spending during the Olympics and early election season,"" according to the CEO. This explains the sequential revenue decline from 2Q16 to 3Q16, and could potentially add another $36 million in revenue, by my estimation.Of course, the biggest driver by far will be the seasonal effect. Groupon is subject to the same consumer behavior that brick-and-mortar retailers are. Perhaps even more so since consumers with a tight budget will be better off shopping at Groupon. In 4Q15, the company reported $914, while revenue stood at $714 in 3Q15.Groupon is making some progress with its business. This can be deduced from the fact that the North America segment reported 10% year-over-year growth. I expected this year-over-year growth to be present in 4Q16. Perhaps even more than 10%, since the company has added to its market efforts. However, in a conservative estimate, I'll set the growth at 5% and add $15 million in revenue from LivingSocial. My (conservative) revenue estimate of $975 million is thus above the guidance of $942 million. I even think it within the realm of possibility that Groupon reports $1 billion in revenue. This can be accomplished if the company were to report a 10% year-over-year growth. I don't model any ""extra"" revenue from the marketing efforts. Instead, I assume that the off-line marketing efforts will help produce at least 5% year-over-year growth.EPS: A few words on non-GAAP vs. GAAPOnce you've looked at enough financial statements, you start to pick up things. Some companies are incredibly transparent in their report, almost as if to brag. Some are complacent, and with others, it is as if they'd prefer that certain things remain hard to understand. Don't confuse this with accounting fraud necessarily - it's just me nagging about a pet peeve of mine. Groupon falls under the latter category. I'm always disappointed to see constant non-GAAP reporting, because I now have to understand what exactly this non-GAAP means with this particular company. With Groupon, it means:Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP performance measures that adjust our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and earnings (loss) per share to exclude the impact of...A long list. Some might argue that the company also reports the GAAP earnings, and so I shouldn't waste any words on this. The problem with this is that Wall Street estimates according to a company's own reporting practices. The media, in turn, reports news according the company's standards. This creates headlines like ""Groupon beats by $0.01, beats on revenue"". The company's non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.01 in 3Q16, but it is rarely stated in the news that this is non-GAAP. The actually earnings per share was -$0.07 (net income of -$37 million). Of course, the number one reason I detest non-GAAP reporting is because I must estimate accordingly. There's no point in me looking at the GAAP number when everyone is looking at the non-GAAP number, and since non-GAAP numbers can be anything, it takes extra time to figure this out.A pet peeve: Stock-based compensationOf the -$0.07 in GAAP loss, -$0.05 cents was related to stock-based compensation. This is one item that I find particularly ridiculous. There is really no reason to adjust for stock-based compensation, and it is easy to see why this practice is non-GAAP: it obscures the true nature of profitability. If I were to confess that Seeking Alpha is paying me in stock/options, would anyone dare to argue I was not getting paid? And if I were getting paid, that meant they had an expense, because they would be paying me. For the record, I'm not receiving any stock/options.This is all the more true if the company regularly compensates through stock. If we look at previous quarters, we see that this is indeed Groupon's modus operandi. It was not some one-time bonus that was excluded. This is especially concerning since the stock-based compensation was worth $26 million. To add some context to this number, this equals a whopping 62% of operating cash flows and makes up 70% of your losses as a shareholder.Those who've read my work know that I like to focus strictly on estimating earnings, but once in a while, I feel compelled to comment on a company's accounting practices. I usually do this when I feel long-term investors should be alerted to certain practices. That is the bigger picture here. Investors should always go to the source of the financial statements, especially with companies that are struggling or those that are trying to sell a turnaround story. Oftentimes, they are inclined to paint the picture a bit rosier than it is. This, sometimes misguided, optimism is simply human. I'll end this paragraph by offering the following consideration to investors: Groupon would be profitable if the company wouldn't pay itself so much. One can thus wonder if such compensation is deserved in the current situation, since it clearly comes at the expense of the shareholder.EPSWe have now finally arrived at the last piece of the puzzle. Estimating earnings per share is a bit trickier for the reasons I've explained above. Earlier I noted Groupon has a long list of items that go into the creation of the non-GAAP number. As stated in the revenue paragraph, the company is expecting higher year-over-year margins in the fourth quarter. If we account for that, I believe the non-GAAP net income margin will likely be around 2.4%, which would indicate EPS of $0.04 for the fourth quarter. The increased margin is driven by higher year-over-year margins, adding back stock-based compensation and anticipated amortization of intangible assets. The company also adds back the non-cash interest expense on its convertible notes.ConclusionI'm fairly positive Groupon will beat the high-end revenue estimate of $942. This effectively assume a mere 1.5% year-over-year organic growth. I believe the offline marketing efforts will easily produce at least double that number (3% growth) and, in fact, could realistically secure 5% growth. As Groupon works to secure higher margins and lower costs, I believe the Wall Street non-GAAP EPS consensus of $0.03 per share is on the low side. The company should realistically be able to beat that number. I even think it could beat my own estimate of $0.04 in earnings per share and revenue of $975 million."
4058610,95846,2017-03-28T15:49:44-04:00,Currency neutral growth is near zero for gross billings and total revenue.Share repurchases are primarily reducing dilution from stock-based compensation.The company is likely not an acquisition target.,"For a company that was once said to be the fastest growing startup ever, Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) performance in the public markets has surely disappointed many investors.With the stock down nearly 85% since its 2011 IPO, investors may be tempted to initiate a position; they should not. In the paragraphs below, I will show how even with it massive decline, Groupon's stock is still not cheap enough to initiate a long position.Currency Neutral GrowthSimilar to many global companies domiciled in the United States, Groupon is currently being hurt by the strong US dollar. To correctly judge the company's performance, same country currency neutral measures will be used from the company's 2016 earnings release.Groupon defines gross billings as ""the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services, excluding applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds."" Groupon's total revenue is defined as the gross billings less the merchant's share of the transaction price.Groupon's share price is currently ~$4.00. Using the adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, the trailing P/E ratio would be well above 50.A company with a ~1% same country currency neutral growth in total revenue and declining global unit sales, is not a wise investment at a 50 multiple (adjusted EPS).Share RepurchasesIn August 2013, Groupon announced it would repurchase $300 million of shares. By February 2015, Groupon had repurchased $200 million from this authorization at $7.29 per share.This was followed by an additional repurchase authorization of $300 million in April 2015 followed by an additional $200 million repurchase authorization a few months later in June 2015.Share repurchases are usually meant to boost earnings per share (less shares outstanding). In Groupon's case, the company states the repurchases are ""intended to partially offset dilution from employee stock grants.""The table below shows total stock-based compensation for four fiscal years from the company's 10-K forms and investor presentation for 2016.The cumulative stock-based compensation in those four years was $472 million. During the same period, the company announced $800 million in share repurchases. Nearly 60% of the reauthorizations are meant to offset employee compensation.Groupon's market capitalization is ~$2.25 billion today. The 2016 stock-based compensation was nearly 4.5% of its market capitalization. Competitor Wayfair (NYSE:W) with a $3 billion market capitalization had $50 million in equity-based compensation in 2016; more than half the amount of Groupon.Groupon's share repurchases are primarily offsetting employee stock compensation rather than increasing earnings per share. This has minimal benefit to shareholders.Lack of SuitorReading through other Groupon articles on Seeking Alpha, many writers have mentioned the company may be an acquisition target. I disagree with this and don't think Groupon will be acquired.The company's current market capitalization of $2.5 billion leaves only a handful of potential suitors; let's run through them.Marc Lore, CEO of Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) e-Commerce business, has purchased specialty retailers: Hay & Needle, Modcloth, Moosejaw and Shoebuy. The cumulative cost of these four acquisitions was ~$200 million. Groupon would cost at least 10 times more and is likely too generic for Wal-Mart.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) once offered to purchase Groupon for $6 billion. With CFO Ruth Porat, Google has dramatically scaled back its acquisition spree. The company's last billion-dollar plus acquisition was Nest Labs in 2014 and Google hasn't acquired a significant e-Commerce business in the last two years. I cannot see a scenario where Google spends $2.5 billion on an e-Commerce company.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was a large investor in Groupon competitor LivingSocial with a $175 million investment in late 2010. Groupon acquired LivingSocial in late 2016 for an immaterial amount. It's hard to imagine Amazon now acquiring Groupon after Groupon acquired LivingSocial, which Amazon invested in.Other e-Commerce companies like Wayfair and Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) are likely too small to acquire Groupon. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has shown no interest in eCommerce.Groupon likely has no suitors with its $2.5 billion market capitalization.ConclusionIn conclusion, even with its decreased market valuation, Groupon is still not cheap enough to initiate a long position. The company's adjusted total revenue is barely increasing, its share repurchase programs are mostly offsetting dilution from stock-based compensation and there does not seem to be a likely suitor to acquire them.As a long-term investor, I would be most worried about the excessive stock-based compensation. In 2010, pre-Groupon IPO, Fortune Magazine ran a great story on Groupon's current Chairman and previous CEO Eric Lefkoksy. The consistent history of Mr. Lefkoksy personally benefiting while a company he manages falters should be a red flag for all investors."
4047150,22445,2017-02-17T09:54:27-05:00,"Groupon has been in turnaround mode for a long time, and the current quarter confirms that at the very least a bottom is in.The current quarterly results also confirm that the restructuring effort is almost complete.As a result, Groupon's stock should increase, as it was trading at very depressed levels until now.This despite the fact that guidance is nothing to get very excited about.","On my last take on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), I said that while I'm not crazy about the company's metrics, $3.5 per share is a good enough discount for me to be invested in the stock, even if it took several more quarters for the turnaround to fermentAnd as I look at the company's Q4 and year-end results, I think that the turnaround efforts are ahead of schedule.Gross Billings were $1.70 billion in Q4'16, slightly lower from $1.71 billion in Q4'15; however, take into consideration that the company is still exiting markets. In other words, headwinds are still in effect.North America continues to perform well, as gross billings increased 6%. New customers and the acquisition of LivingSocial is the main reason contributing to this success. EMEA gross billings declined by 9% (5% FX-neutral) and 'Rest of World' declined by 15% (15% FX-neutral).So overall, growth in North America is compensating very well for the fall in revenue elsewhere during this restructuring period. This was something I was worried about 12 months ago.Revenue was $934.9 million in Q4, compared to $917.2 million in Q4'15. North America again was the bright spot with a 5% increase, vs. a decline of 2% in EMEA, and 12% for the rest of the world.Finally, gross profit was about the same, and came in at $369.9 million in Q4'16, vs. $371.7 million in Q4'15. North America again was the bright spot, as gross profit increased 14%, vs. a decline of 25% for EMEA and 10% for Rest of World decline.What is very clear from these results is the company has managed to offset losing revenue and gross profits as it exits markets by increased revenue mainly from North America.Higher gross profit in North America more than compensates for lost revenue as the company is exiting countries as part of its restructuring. In other words, the company is doing a great job in its restructuring efforts. Hat tip to management on my behalf.Non-GAAP net income was $0.07 per share, and beat the Street estimate by a whopping $0.05 per share. The company also beat on revenue by about $22 million, but I consider this secondary.Also notable was that free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $269 million for Q4'16, and cash and equivalents were $891.8 million.Stock-based compensation for Q4 totaled about $23 million. However the company also repurchased 12.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $49.9 million. So the net total is fewer outstanding shares.And according to the company's latest filing, as of February 13, 2017, there were 562,074,014 shares outstanding, vs. 573.56 million the previous quarter.I was actually worried GRPN might discontinue with its share repurchase program. However, with these results, I am now confident the company will continue to repurchase shares.As such, I think that the outstanding $195 million under the company's repurchase program will eventually be exhausted, even if there is no guarantee from the company it will do so.And as a reminder, for the full year, the company repurchased 43,227,743 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $162.4 million.GRPN Shares Outstanding data by YChartsIn fact, if we look at the above chart, the slope depicting the outstanding share count is once again in a downward trend. The way I see it, even if revenue does not grow, as long as the company is producing healthy cash flow and can repurchase shares, then GRPN's stock should increase over time. That's good enough for me folks.The company has said for a while that it expects to exit 11 markets, and limit its footprint to 15 countries going forward. This exodus is expected to be completed by Q1'17.So basically, the streamlining will continue and that should provide for better financial results for 2017. The company is guiding 2017 EBITDA to be in the range between $200 million and $240 million, a Y/Y range increase between $16 to $56 million. However, I think they could do a lot better.So is GRPN a buy?Yes for three reasons. To begin with, this is still a company that is turning around. And if the company can increase revenue and gross profit with restructuring headwinds, I think it will do a whole lot better when the restructuring finishes.And based on the adjusted EPS of the current quarter, I think that $0.30 adjusted EPS for 2017 will not prove a difficult target.The second has to do with the stock's valuation. The current market cap of the company is about $2.65 billion. That is still less than 1X revenue, even after the current rally.I know people think that using Price/Sales is a bad metric; however, it is a very good comparison when weighing market caps. Let me give you some examples, although the comparison is not apples to apples.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for example has a Price/Sales ratio of 5.65, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) 3.85, and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) 6.4. Like I said, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. However, if GRPN's profitability increases, then this metric might help us establish a comparative price target. This is why I consider GRPN a possible multi-bagger stock.Finally, like many other stocks I have written about, GRPN was also trading at very depressed levels. Today, however, GRPN is turning around. By virtue of the fact that GRPN is turning around is a good enough reason for the market to adjust the market cap of the company upwards.And that's what I think is currently happening, even if guidance is nothing to get excited about."
4037190,102413,2017-01-17T03:34:12-05:00,"At face value, Groupon appears to have a lot of cash on hand which could be useful in executing its turnaround.
        Is that really the case though? I look through their finances to show why their cash position is far from comfortable.
        What is the real end game here?","A few weeks ago, I made a very bearish call on Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) before its Q3 results. The thesis for the timing of the option play was based on an overall market selloff. While that has not materialized, Groupon none the less is down about 28% since that call. My option play has yielded about 25% if you exit it right now but can yield significantly higher returns if the stock continues to fall over the next few months.I was discussing this call with a few friends a couple of days back. My argument was that even though this is a low dollar price stock, its high Market Cap (Over $2 Billion as of previous close) meant we were still far away from hitting a bottom. The counter argument I got was that Groupon had close to $690MM in Cash and Cash Equivalents as of Q3 2016 (See line item on balance sheet below) and that gave them a lot of flexibility in orchestrating a turnaround for the company and created significant upside risk for the stock price. In this article I will illustrate why this is far from the truth.Groupon's Cashflow cycleA lot of people may be just looking at Groupon's cash position and giving them the benefit of the doubt in executing their turnaround. A cursory look at the balance sheet shows Groupon has cash and cash equivalents of $690MM. The truth is far less rosy. Here is how Groupon's ""Group Discount"" program works.1) A user purchases a Groupon on their site. He/She pays by Credit Card/Paypal (NASDAQ: PYPL) etc. These monies immediately go to the line item highlighted below in Groupon's balance sheet.2) Groupon however still needs to pay the merchant for their service. Groupon creates a Liability on its Balance Sheet and calls it ""Accrued merchant and supplier payables"" highlighted below.3) Some time after the campaign ends (see the note from their FAQ below), Groupon pays the merchant their cut of the fee and this item hits the Cashflow statement again as ""Accrued merchant and supplier payables""The slush fundSo the cash position is not really that much of an asset. They need this cash to pay their merchants for the goods/services sold on their site. As of Q3 2016, Groupon had $690MM in Cash and $609MM of Accrued merchant and supplier payables against it. But the story does not end here. Take a look at one of the risks noted in their S1.Essentially they are using the funds they collect from their customers as working capital. Now if you go back to the balance sheet and add in the Accrued expenses and payables net of receivables you are left with a deficit of $220MM. What this means is that if Groupon is not able to keep growing its revenues to pay its merchants and other debts, it will have to in fact raise more money. I won't call it a ponzi scheme but it certainly shares some characteristics.The End gameSo what is the end game here? Some people are keen to point out that Groupon has been successful in select locations. While I have no doubt Groupon can be successful in select markets, is that really a $2-3 Billion dollar opportunity? Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) shut down its ""Google Offers"" service in March of 2014. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shut down its ""Amazon Local"" in December of 2015. LivingSocial which Amazon also had a stake in was sold to Groupon in November of last year for a ""Non-material"" price. I believe the reason is simple. There just isn't a big enough profitable market for this to get the big boys interested. Recently there was chatter of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) wanting to buy groupon but it was quickly followed by more rumors that this was not true. While Alibaba did take a 5.6% stake in Groupon in Q4 of 2015, I do not believe they would be interested in taking over the company. If you listen to Jack Ma, he always talks about how Alibaba wants to be the gateway for western brands to sell into the Chinese market, not the other way around. I don't believe Groupon will be bailed out.ConclusionAt the face of it, Groupon appears to have a lot of cash on hand which can be a good buffer as it plans its turnaround. But if you peel the onion, you realize that its position is far from comfortable. Groupon needs to keep raising new money from customers to pay its past debts. A takeover scenario also looks very remote with most big players having already tried and given up on the business. While the price per share is low, it is still a $2 Billion dollar company because of the large float. The stock price has a long way to fall. Groupon is a sell.Supporting Documents"
4038602,102413,2017-01-23T08:36:32-05:00,Groupon takes on the Credit risk of its merchants every time it sells a Groupon on its site.Is Groupon really qualified to properly evaluate these risks? Does it have other conflicts of interest?Groupon can be significantly impacted by economic cycles. Can Groupon survive a recession?,"I recently wrote an article illustrating why Groupon's (NASDAQ: GRPN) cash position is not as rosy as a lot of people think. In this article I will cover another aspect I considered as part of the short thesis I put forth a few months back. While the concept of credit risk has been brought up from time to time, I feel it is significantly under researched in Groupon's case.Lender of last resortLet's consider a hypothetical example. Say you are a small business owner with a burger joint in the US and things are not going so well for you. Business is not that great and cash is running low. You go to your local bank and they reject your loan application. What do you do?Suddenly a Groupon Sales person comes along and tells you what you really need is a new way of marketing your product. Start a Groupon campaign, he says. So you do and you create a campaign selling your famous $10 ""Meat Castle"" burger for $6. Groupon keeps half of this and the burger itself costs you $3 to make so there is no profit here, but hey, it is a marketing campaign.Great news! A 1000 people buy your Groupon deal! Groupon sends you a check for $1000 promising to send another one for the same amount 30 days later followed by a final one within 60 days that take cancellations etc into account (See FAQ note below).Now what you should really be doing is setting this money aside for the ingredients you need to make the burgers when you customers redeem their coupon. But hey, you have to make rent and money is fungible right? So you use the check to pay the rent and keep the shop open for another month. But unfortunately you cannot make payroll the next month and eventually need to shut down.Now all this while only 200 people have redeemed their Groupons. The remaining customers come to your storefront and find a closed burger joint. They are not happy and go back to the Groupon Customer Support and ask for a refund. Groupon having been the intermediary and going by the ""Groupon Promise"" is forced to refund the remaining 800 customers while eating the loss.Cyclical businessesWhy is this important? To be fair, as long as the economy is expanding, this is unlikely to become a big issue. Yes, there will be fraudulent companies running campaigns on Groupon and some that legitimately fail during a campaign but the numbers should be manageable in a growing economy. The issue becomes more pertinent when we enter a downturn. As more and more small business run into problems in a recession, they are driven to companies like Groupon as a last ditch effort to try to finance their operations and stay alive. Groupon for its part is not a bank. It does not have the means or expertise to properly gauge the credit risk of these small enterprises. The fact, as I showed in my previous article, the company is using the revenue collected from its customers as working capital. This adds a further wrinkle to this equation. The more Groupon needs the new revenue to manage its working capital needs, the more it is susceptible to take on the additional credit risk of marginal merchants.So how do you value the company? Just as any other cyclical company, it should be valued through the economic cycle. This means we take the performance of the company from peak to trough of the cycle and look at its overall performance during this period. This is the reason why valuation of cyclical stocks such as automobile companies [such as General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford (NYSE: F)] look more attractive near the peak of the cycle. People are just discounting the fact that the company will be impacted more negatively during a recession. The problem with Groupon however is that it has not been in existence long enough to go through a cycle. We just don't know how bad it is going to get (or even if it will survive) through a recession. The company has failed to make a profit in an expanding economy, so how is it expected to survive a recession?ConclusionThere are several risks to be considered when investing in a company like Groupon. One often overlooked is the credit risk the company is taking on. While this may not have a material impact when the economy is expanding, it is none the less a risk to consider as we look towards a potential recession in the near future. Recognizing that Groupon is in fact a very cyclical company further challenges its current valuation."
4001916,25265,2016-08-24T17:29:49-04:00,"Groupon reported better than expected Q2 results and the stock has rallied 48% since.However the revenue growth Groupon is experiencing is not sustainable and will reverse when the increased market spend is pulled.There is no margin of safety at this valuation, and longs should consider reducing their exposure.","Last month Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) posted Q2 results that headily beat analyst's expectations. Revenues, EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS all came in above consensus, though profitability is still nonexistent. The market loved it nonetheless and shares soared, closing up 29% the following day. Shares have continued to climb and now sit a whopping 48% above where they traded prior to the earnings release. Part of the surge was likely due to a short squeeze, as 52M shares (12% of the float) were short prior to the earnings release. The bulls point to an impressive pick-up in active customers that drove revenue growth of 7% year-over-year on an fx neutral basis as a reason for optimism. The company is in the midst of a turnaround plan underpinned by increased marketing spend (incremental $150M-$250M this year) and a downsizing of the company's footprint as it narrows its geographic focus. Groupon has succeeded with phase I of its plan, which was to return to growth. However, the growth Groupon is experiencing today is not profitable growth - nor is it sustainable. The rest of this article will focus on why Groupon's strategy to win back customers is flawed and will ultimately fail.Groupon's investment in marketing spend consists of a lot of discounts on top of discounts. Here are a few of the offers that traveled through my inbox this week.No these are not ""limited time offers"" as the company makes them appear to be. The same discounts have shown up in my inbox nearly every week this year. These offers have clearly succeeded in raising the active customer count and sales, but it has done so at a very high cost. The company would like you to believe that they will achieve a 100% return on investment (ROI) on the incremental marketing spend within 12-18 months. However so far the only thing the incremental marketing spend has succeeded in doing is lowering cash flow. Here is a chart from Groupon's Q2 earnings presentation showing the rapid deterioration in operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.Here is a look at free-cash-flow on a quarter-by-quarter basis. You can see the rapid decline in free-cash-flow year-over-year as the marketing spend ramped up.Source: financial statementsThrough the first half of 2016, free cash flow is down $166M year-over-year, which, consequently, is well in excess of the incremental marketing spend over the same period (marketing expense +$35M in Q2 YoY). Ouch. The negative free cash flow through the first half of 2016 is -$167.1M, by far Groupon's worst performance as a public company. While Groupon still has plenty of cash on its balance sheet, it is down considerably from the peak in 2013 ($780M as of Q2 versus $1.24B in 2013). In addition, the company just issued $250M in convertible notes. Had it not done so its cash balance would have fallen to $618M in Q2.Why This Strategy Will FailMany companies have utilized the coupon strategy to bolster sales only to regret it later. It rarely works out in the long-run. The problem is that customers get addicted to coupons. Groupon already is a discount seller of goods and services. To offer unprofitable discounts on top of discounts in order to entice customers to make a purchase is not a good business model. Once consumers are given coupons, they never want to shop without them. When you try to dial them back, which Groupon will undoubtedly have to do at some point, customers revolt and do not spend at the same level.History is filled with failed couponing strategies. One such example is J.C. Penney (NYSE:JCP). Does everyone remember Ron Johnson, the Apple retail executive that was brought in to reinvent J.C. Penney? Here is a really good article from the Harvard Business Review that details how JC Penney's ""Fair and Square"" pricing strategy backfired. Here are a couple of passages that I think are most relevant to Groupon's current strategy.I believe Groupon will fall into the same trap as J.C. Penney. It is indeed difficult to break from the past. Will Groupon customers come to its site to shop once the additional discounts are removed? History tells us they will not shop with the same frequency. People came to Groupon in search of a real bargain. This year they are getting one. But next year, when marketing spend is dialed back, the company will have to fight the perception in the consumer's eye that the bargains are not as great as they once were. This will lead to less frequent purchases than in 2016. After a bad earnings miss in early 2012, the then CEO of JCP said that ""coupons were a drug."" The COO went on to say ""We did not realize how deep some of the customers were into this."" (source) Let's remember why Groupon went on this marketing blitz in the first place - mainly because sales were weak. Injecting marketing spend to boost sales only to remove it later is a strategy destined for failure.Macy's (NYSE:M) also tried and failed to eliminate coupons in 2005. In the same article referenced above, the Macy's CFO is quoted as saying ""people love those coupons. They love thinking they got us. From a customer perspective, it's been very important."" The problem for Groupon is that it is not profitable with its current level of discounting, whereas Macy's was profitable with couponing. If Groupon is forced to continue the deep discounts past this year, the fundamentals of the business will further deteriorate.Another example of a failed couponing strategy is Chipotle. In the first quarter of 2016 the company rolled out an aggressive marketing campaign in which it gave out over $50M worth of free burritos. The company thought that would be enough to get sales back on track. However comparable sales once again missed the mark in Q2 (comps -23.6% vs. -20.6 consensus expectations), leading the company to start a rewards program aimed at increasing frequency of visits and attracting new customers. Chipotle will likely find that it too should never have started giving away food for free. In fact, the company does not even know if its strategy is working. It would have been better served to use those marketing dollars to tell their story to consumers and talk about how they were working to overcome the food issues experienced last year.Another separate reason for the likely long-term failure of Groupon's strategy is that the novelty of the business model has worn off. I can no longer find any good restaurants near me that are using Groupon. There's also a lot more competition in the market today, including Amazon, Living Social and CertifiKid. The only purchase I have made through Groupon this year has been a free pair of Apple ear buds (I had a $10 off coupon with no minimum). I did have to pay $3.99 for shipping, but it was still a good deal. It was likely not a profitable sale for Groupon. In 2015 I made five purchases with Groupon.So if you buy the argument that couponing is a dangerous strategy and will be difficult to unwind, Groupon could be in some serious trouble. It is clear that the company is not profitable at the current level of marketing spend - certainly not profitable enough to justify this valuation. The bulls want to believe that the growth in the customer base in 2016 will lead to sustainable sales after marketing spend is reduced. However, history tells us that will not be the case. Consumers get addicted to coupons and deep discounts. They are not going to shop with Groupon with the same frequency if they are not getting the deep discounts. This is why I believe Groupon's strategy will ultimately fail. I believe sales will decline once the marketing spend is dialed back. If sales decline 10% from the current level of $3.1B, that will be the loss of $136M in gross margin dollars, assuming a 44% gross margin. That will largely offset lower marketing spend.Estimates are too high for FY2017. I expect revenue will decline, not grow 3.9% as Wall Street currently forecasts (source: Bloomberg consensus). Free cash flow will again be weak. I do not believe the current valuation gives investors any margin of safety. It is stretched and the risk is to the downside, not the upside. I would look to reduce exposure after this massive run-up. The stock could do okay for the rest of 2016, but once the company starts to dial-back marketing spend I suspect the risks to the downside will intensify."
4019662,22445,2016-11-04T12:00:55-04:00,"As I have said in a previous article, I sold my shares in Groupon some time ago close to $6 a share.I am now hoping that the company's restructuring efforts along with investor fatigue might push the stock to $3.50 a share or below.If I am successful in buying at those levels, my chances of doubling my money will be very high when the restructuring process is over.","On my last article of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), I told you I had sold my position (please consider: Why I Sold Groupon). The reason for my change of stance was that, last quarter I was expecting better growth and a lot more in terms of profitability.When that didn't happen, my guess was that there would not be much excitement for the stock anymore. And even if I thought the company was fairly valued, I also thought it would very difficult for the stock to reach levels above $6 a share. So I sold.In its recent quarter GRPN beat the consensus on all fronts. EPS came in at a net loss of $0.01 per, when analysts were modeling a net loss of $0.02 per share. Revenue came in at $720 vs $713 million Y/Y, topping analysts estimates of $710.5 million (yawn).My first observation is so what. We are talking about a $5 stock, and a penny here and there does not mean anything (according to me). And while GRPN beat on revenue, the $7 million in additional revenue does not really matter much when your market cap is around $3 billion.Global units sold declined 5% Y/Y to 49 million, primarily driven by country exits and restructuring efforts. As has been the case over the past several quarters, units sold in North America increased 4%, while EMEA units declined 8%, and in the rest of world units declined 31%. Again, the culprit is restructuring.The company is raising its revenue guidance for the full year to between $3.075 billion and $3.150 billion, vs the consensus of $3.1 billion in revenue (big yawn).And finally, GRPN also beat the consensus in terms of EBITDA, $32.1 million vs an expected $28.4 million (Champaign bottles open).What I want to say is, all this is fine, however GRPN is not growing and furthermore, it is not living up to market expectations. Several quarters ago when the stock went from $3 to $6, the market had high expectations that profits were finally here, and that revenue growth would be forthcoming. These expectations have not fermented yet.Granted that the company is being held back by restructuring efforts, but like I said, the market was expecting otherwise.One thing I was very disappointed about, was that in the conference call not a single word was mentioned about Orderup, GRPN's food delivery arm. To be honest, I had high hopes for this division, but not much seems to be happening, or else I imagine GRPN's management would have said something.During the quarter, Groupon reduced its country footprint to 26 markets, and management said that it aims to only operate in only 15 markets in the future. One question I have is what will the entire revenue footprint look like after that. I mean one of the reasons for GRPN's appeal all these years had been that it would operate everywhere and take over the world. Worldwide global coupon domination is not happening.On a positive note (one of the few), the company repurchased 5.2 million shares during the quarter, for a an aggregate purchase price of $24.6 million. As I have said on previous articles, this was one of the main reasons I was long GRPN many months ago.However cash on the balance sheet is lower by about $164 million Y/Y, so it is not a given that the company will continue to repurchase shares at the same pace as it has until now. And looking at the slope of the above chart, it seems to be flattening.And to be honest, while I was expecting more from the company, I was not really expecting much, knowing that it is still in the middle of its restructuring effort. However I was hoping that the total share count would continue to shrink as it has over the past year.See I was willing to give the company the benefit in the absence of growth, because the share count was shrinking. In the absence of shares being retired at the same rate over the past year, there are not many reasons to own the stock with growth at a standstill.How to play GrouponI honestly believe management's restructuring efforts will prove to be successful. However, we do not know what the company will look like when the process is over.At the same time, growth in the U.S. is in the single digits. This is nothing to get excited about. So there is no real reason to bid up the stock yet, expecting high growth, even assuming the restructuring effort has finished. I am hoping that Orderup will eventually help the company grow in the U.S., however so far that is not the case.So what I propose is to wait it out for 2-3 quarters. If I am correct, there will not be much interest in GRPN shares, that will probably cause investor fatigue, something that might cause the shares to correct more than we imagine.So my strategy for GRPN will be to try to buy the stock again below the $3.5 share level.. In fact I would be willing to buy GRPN below $3.5, even in the middle of its restructuring effort, because I think that anywhere below that I am getting the shares at a good discount.Even if the stock goes nowhere for several quarters, buying below the $3.5 level increases my possibility to double my money over the next 12-18 months, assuming the restructuring of the company is done with, and growth kicks in."

        The acquisition will add 1 million N. America customers to Groupon's 29 million customer base.
        Assuming Groupon didn't overpay, the consolidation deal is a quick way to increase market share and remove a small competitor.","Quick TakeSmall business marketing company Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) announced on October 24, 2016, that it entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of privately-held LivingSocial, an online coupon service.This tuck-in acquisition will add 1 million LivingSocial users to Groupon's North America customer list of 29.1 million users.Assuming Groupon didn't overpay for those customers, this deal is a good example of patient management waiting for the right time to increase market share.Target CompanyLivingSocial offers an electronic discount coupon service to help local businesses attract first-time customers.Service and product categories include:Below is an video about LivingSocial's 'Experience' service:(Source:LivingSocial YouTube)LivingSocial was founded in 2007, had raised $928 million in venture capital and was valued in a 2011 financing round at $6 billion.TermsThe companies did not announce the terms or amount of the acquisition, which is expected to close by early November 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.Groupon said the ""acquisition consideration is not material.""As a result, it does not have to disclose the price paid, although it is not uncommon to find that information disclosed in future SEC filings.RationaleAccording to CEO Rich Williams, the acquisition is primarily a customer base expansion.The deal will add 1 million of LivingSocial's active customers to Groupon's existing US customer base of 29.1 million users, or 3.4%.Per Groupon's most recent 10-Q, it had 50.7 million active customers in the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2016.With an annual gross revenue of $3 billion, that results in an average of $59.17 revenue per customer.Of course, that is inclusive of their operations worldwide, so the US average is likely to be higher, perhaps an estimated $75 per customer, perhaps discounted to $50.Since LivingSocial is contributing 1 million customers to Groupon's customer base, the incremental value to Groupon would be an estimated $50 million.Groupon's annualized sales and marketing expense rate in the US is 38%, so hypothetically it would spend 38% of $50 million, or $19 million to acquire 1 million new US customers.Therefore, my best guess is that Groupon paid somewhere under $20 million for LivingSocial.CommentaryBoth companies were born out of the ""deal of the day"" concept which became popular during the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008.After the recession ended, cost conscious consumers continued to use the convenient coupon & deal opportunities to save money.However, small business merchants became less enamored of the service, as they did not see the kind of return business they expected to receive in return for significant discounts.Also, as the economy improved from the recession lows, there was less demand from the consumer side for discounts. As a result, the marketplace of buyers and sellers of discounts, which is effectively what these two companies operate, slowed.Concurrent with the acquisition announcement, Groupon also said it plans to reduce the number of countries in which it operates from 27 to 15, in order to focus on the US and Europe.Groupon also reported quarterly financial results along with the announcement and raised its revenue guidance range to between $3.075 and $3.150 billion for 2016.It expects its 2016 adjusted EBITDA range to be between $150 million and $165 million.I write about IPOs, M&A, and tech 'unicorns'.

3989509,101831,2016-07-19T14:08:28-04:00,Groupon shares spiked 10% yesterday on an analyst upgrade.Shares have been crushed over 75% in the last couple years.The company is narrowing its focus to its North American markets.A new marketing initiative could prove valuable if executed correctly.,"Yesterday shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shot up over 10% on news that Piper Jaffray had upgraded the stock to overweight. The Piper analyst quoted a price target of $6 within the year for the company currently trading at just under $4 a share. This news was a breath of fresh air for Groupon shareholders who have been blasted with negative analyst ratings over the past year.With this surprising upgrade, the question now becomes, is the pop just hype, or is this the start of a Groupon turnaround? In this article, I will discuss the company's current business, look at their future prospects, and detail the potential risks associated with investing in Groupon.Shares of Groupon haven't had the easiest ride the past few years. The stock has been slashed 75% since 2014 with little signs of hope along the way. With Groupon announcing earning in a couple weeks, investors should be aware of the extreme volatility that is likely to take place. Groupon shares have historically been witness to large swings in both upward and downward directions when it comes to earnings announcements. Knowing this, risk-averse investors will want to be on the sidelines for this event, but for those with a higher risk appetite, we can examine the direction the company is most likely to move.Despite the negative trajectory the company has taken the last few years, they are still fighting to turn the coupon ship around. Lately, they have been making moves to cut costs by slashing much of their international business and putting more emphasis stateside. Gross billings sank 5% last quarter as the drop was largely due to their exit from several international markets. North American billings actually spiked during this same period. As North America has shown continual growth, Groupon has shifted their focus to rely more heavily on this market.In an effort to make their name relevant again, Groupon laid out a nationwide advertising campaign earlier this year - the first campaign of this scale since 2011. With this, the company hopes it can recreate the early buzz that allowed them to spread so rapidly in the beginning. Groupon has said it plans on increasing ad spending by $150-$200 million this year. That increased spending has some analysts worried as they feel Groupon should be looking to cut - not spend - during this trying time. Piper Jaffray sees things differently. They believe Groupon is being strategic in how it spends these marketing dollars. Their goal is to narrow the focus of their products and regions to categories they have the best chance to succeed in. In this initiative, the company will emphasize the ""local deal"" - the aspect of the business where they have had the greatest success. If the increased ad spending is successful, Piper believes Groupon will have higher rates of capital productivity, which in turn will lead to the creation of shareholder value. As for the numbers, the analyst believes the $150-$200 million advertising budget will capture between 3.5 and 4.5 million new customers and boost gross profit by $215-$280 million. If the Piper analyst is correct, these numbers would represent twice the current Wall Street forecast.These numbers may be on the high end but let's see what accomplishing these figures would do for the company. If attained it would mean the marketing initiative would bring in as much as $80 million in new operating profit. That would be enough cash to eliminate the $55 million a year operating loss the company is currently dealing with. Even if they miss this target and the marketing dollars yield substantially less profit they will still have a chance of eliminating or coming close to eliminating that operating deficit and becoming profitable. Over time the hope is some of these customers brought in by the marketing effort will stick around, which would allow them to increase profits even more in subsequent years.The best thing going for Groupon may be its strong balance sheet. Despite the slump in their recent numbers, the company is flush with almost $700 million in cash. This allows them a level of flexibility not afforded to most in their situations. It also means they won't be forced into making unfavorable deals and can instead make strategic decisions that are best for their long-term growth. For 2016 the company has stated a target of $2.75 billion to $3.05 billion in revenue. With its active user base growing-now at 27 million active customers - this is a realistic goal. That said, with a market cap of more than $2.2 billion, shares are currently trading at over 100 times last year's earnings. From a valuation perspective, it's hard to make the case that Groupon is undervaluedBottom lineWith the second quarter earnings announcement fast approaching, and the knowledge of how volatile Groupon has historically reacted, those with less tolerance for risk will want to stay far away from Groupon. However, those willing to roll the dice on a company that seems to have begun a turnaround they could be rewarded handsomely for the risk they take on. With a large cash horde, strong state-side growth and a rejuvenated advertising initiative, Groupon may just return to profitability in the next year or two."
3993087,67313,2016-07-29T03:56:27-04:00,GRPN’s Q2 beat consensus with a forecast suggesting positive outlook in revenue and EBITDA.Customer acquisitions appear to be on track as GRPN focuses on improving user experience and platform quality.Remain bullish on the stock and continue to consider it to be a key beneficiary of the O2O trend.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) surprised the market with better than expected revenue and EBITDA while customer acquisition remains steady as the company added over a million new customers during the quarter in North America, bringing the total number to 27.9m as of June 30th. As the company continue to dispose unprofitable operating segments and become a more focused company, I believe that higher quality deals will draw customers into the platform and this could lead to a sustained revenue and EBITDA growth. The better than expected EBITDA growth suggests that seems to be the case and certainly shows that the CEO Rich Williams has made a lasting mark in GRPN since his arrival last year. The communication with investors has also improved and this has been allowing investors to become more comfortable with the name.Going forward, I see several drivers that will be accretive to GRPN's growth outlook in the coming months. First, the company still has around $75m-$125m in incremental marketing spend for the second half to maintain the momentum in the North American local business market. There is also ongoing enhancement on product quality, which I previously said will be critical to drive recurring users on the platform, particularly on the product side. I remain bullish on GRPN post results and continue to believe the company to be a key beneficiary of the O2O trend in North America. Looking at case studies in Asia such as Dianping-Meituan or Nuomi (NASDAQ:BIDU), we can see that the group-buy business is an essential component of any large internet company's ecosystem. As Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gradually move into local advertising and services, I believe that GRPN will be an attractive asset destined for takeout.Revenue of $756m beat consensus $711m with EPS loss per share of $0.01 compared with consensus $0.02 loss per share. The company guided year revenue $3.0b-$3.1b compared with prior estimate of $2.75b - $3.05b and consensus $3.02b, suggesting that GRPN's prior challenges may be seeing a rebound as the platform continues to gain traction among the customers. Although investors will see a $25m hit from the Brexit, long-term margin profile should be sustainable as GRPN shuts down unprofitable businesses as such the Indonesian unit in Q3 and I believe that GRPN's initiative of becoming a more focused company will be a long-term positive.GRPN is certainly keen on simplifying its business to be competitive in the local ad/services segment with further reduction on the empty calorie (ie. negative margin categories in the goods segment) and increased focus on higher value-add deals that are more suitable to the mainstream. Evidence of improvement is apparent with shopping margins increase for the third quarter up to 13.4%, a 240bps y/y gain. As for the mobile app, the company acknowledges that its app is lagging behind that of its peers from overseas market and this is important given that it shows GRPN will be aggressive on closing this gap in when it comes to deal quality, platform scale and convenience in payments and/or booking.GRPN is not out of the woods yet and still has a lot to work on but Q2 suggests that it is moving towards the right direction. Remain bullish on the stock."
3991703,67313,2016-07-26T15:59:46-04:00,GRPN will report Q2 after market on Wednesday with the market focusing on local market take-rates and gross margin of new customers.Near-term restructuring on underperforming business and markets will be key to profitability.Remain bullish on North America’s O2O outlook and GRPN’s clear competitive advantage over the larger players.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will report its Q2 earnings after market on Wednesday. The market will be focusing on declining local take rates and gross margin profile on new customers in light of rising competitive risk. I am fairly bullish on GRPN and see two positive catalysts for the stock. First, ongoing stability and growing O2O trends will continue to support the company's near-term growth outlook.Second, industry consolidation will continue to favor GRPN either as an acquirer or a target. With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) showing increasing interest in the local deal space, GRPN is an attractive target due to its solid industry standing in that the larger players do not have sufficient experience and merchant relationship that GRPN has established over the years so it is more efficient to consolidate the space via M&A rather than waging a costly price war on users and deals.Consensus expects:2Q rev. est. $711.2m (range $681m-$739m)2Q adj. EBITDA est. $24.7m (range $18.2m to $40.4m)2Q est. adj loss $0.02 (range loss -$0.06 to EPS of $0.01).On guidance:Revenue forecast of $3.02b (range $2.88b-$3.09b) compared with company forecast $2.75b-$3.05b.EBITDA est. $116.9m (range $106m-$136m), compared with company forecast $85m-$135m.GRPN's focus on smaller number of markets and high frequency categories such as food delivery bodes well for the platform but the deceleration in the US unique visitors during the quarter (+36% y/y vs. +41% y/y) suggests potential impact of competition from FB and AMZN that have taken renewed interest in the local market, which continues to remain vastly under-penetrated relative to search, social media, or even online video.Although there are certainly opportunities, it is also important to note that the local ad segment has SMEs being their predominant customer base that have below average ad budget compared with that of the national advertisers. Because of the inconsistent ad spending by the SMEs due to volatile budget and revenue profile, it is difficult for the larger ad platforms such as FB to fully capitalize on this segment given their prior experience dealing with the larger networks.That said, I believe companies with deep local ties such as GRPN that have been in this space for an extended period will continue to operate better than the larger players.In the near term, customer acquisition and restructuring of the international operations will be necessary for GRPN to shift back to profitability. Although the recent exit of underperforming markets is a good start, I still need to see asset sale of poor performing segments to be more comfortable on the stock. Additionally, margin improvement in the Goods segment by focusing more on profitability rather than scale, and finally, improving ROI from its latest marketing push.Conclusion:I am bullish on GRPN and see it to be a contender in North America's O2O space."
3999698,22445,2016-08-15T16:59:00-04:00,"Groupon was a very depressed stock two quarters ago, that's why I wrote it was a screaming buy.Today however it's not a bargain anymore.Reason being - I was expecting better growth and profitability, none of which fermented. AS such, I'm not excited about Groupon shares anymore.","On my last take on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), I told you that I thought GRPN would double from the $3 a share mark (please consider: Groupon's Discount Might Be Fleeting). Indeed, since February 11 when I wrote that article, GRPN has done just that.The question now is, if you followed my advice back then, do you still hold GRPN or do you sell and take a profit?To begin with, when I started talking about going long GRPN (several articles ago) it was because I saw the stock as a ""turnaround work in progress."" I thought eventually the turnaround effort would work, and the market would eventually notice. Also, while I was very negative on the stock two years ago - primarily because of valuation concerns - bellow $3 a share I was in the opposite camp.For those following my style of investing, I put a lot of emphasis on turnaround situations, irrespective if the company lives up to expectations. It is that narrow strip between what the market is anticipating until the quarter comes that most of the short-term profits are made.The mere fact that a company might turn around means big short-term gains, even if the turnaround produces minuscule results. This I believe is the case for GRPN.GRPN has been in turnaround mode for a long time and the new management has done a very good job. For the most part, the turnaround effort has been focused on exiting money losing markets and focusing on North America.And the strategy has worked well. The company has been able to stop the fall in revenue while focusing on more profitable business in North America. And this was very evident about two quarters ago.However, it's one thing to buy GRPN when it was trading at a very depressed valuation, and it's another to buy it fairly valued. In a depressed valuation scenario you could double your money by virtue of the fact that a fundamental bottom is in (as was the case for GRPN 2 quarters ago).When a stock is fairly valued, then its fundamentals have to improve by a lot in order for the stock to go much higher.So the question is, at these levels, do the fundamentals in GRPN merit buying it at these levels?Well if we look at the most recent quarter, it's not that impressive. Yes it beat expectations, but expectations were no big deal.Outside of the fact that GRPN added 1.1 million new customers, everything else was boring. While revenue beat expectations, I would not call a 2% beat a big deal. And while guidance was $3.1 billion for the year, the previous high end guidance was $3.05 billion.Oh yeah, EBITDA came to $34 million vs the consensus of $25.4 million, but so what? GRPN currently has a $3.3 billion market cap. Should I be excited about $34 million in EBITDA? No. So in other words, the quarter was no big deal in my book.And to give you a graphic presentation of how much things are boring, I present the above chart as evidence. EBITDA is around the same levels for years, and the company still can't make any money.Bottom lineThe truth of the matter is that while I was sure GRPN would double six months ago, I also expected more in terms of performance from the company in the quarters to come.Personally I'm not that excited about GRPN anymore. Yes I still think the bottom was in six months ago, and I also think the company will do better in the future. However current guidance is not enough for me to want to open my purse and buy more shares.I mean yes, if the company announces better guidance, or its next quarter surprises us, I think GRPN's stock could go higher. However this time I want to see it with my eyes first, because I'm not buying at depressed prices anymore.My rating on GRPN is a hold for the time being. I do not think you should sell it short either. I would however be a buyer if the stock corrected by some meaningful percentage."
3972987,70065,2016-05-09T03:57:29-04:00,"Groupon has been under enormous pressure for almost its entire life as a public company from a high of $26 to a low of $2.50.I believe Groupon is finally in a position for a real, sustained turnaround.Key strategies underpinning the turnaround include: increased marketing, less discounting, and higher quality merchants.Based on my turnaround model I calculate a target price of $5.80, or upside of 77% from current levels.","From its IPO price of $20 to a high of $26 and a low of $2.50 Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been a troubled story for most of its publicly traded life. Recent signs, however, may indicate that a turnaround is finally under way.GRPN data by YChartsQ1 RecapGroupon recently reported Q1 results that included EBITDA of $31 million (compared to the Street at $21 million) with sales of $732 million (compared to consensus of $718 million). Billings in North American increased 6.5% in the quarter compared to 6% in the previous quarter. Management reaffirmed 2016 revenue guidance of $2.75-$3.05 billion while increasing the EBITDA range to $85 - $135 million. Trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow was $94 million.While these results were not materially ahead of consensus, they indicate that management can deliver on what they've set out do, which provides confidence in the turnaround story which I will outline below.Turnaround Strategies(source: company IR site)I believe Groupon's main challenge continues to be its need for virality (around local deals/offers) which is why management is making important changes such as withdrawing from regions and/or products that are non-core and underperforming (i.e. are a distraction to the customer).Management communicated that they expect North American billings to accelerate more in the back half of the year as new customers increase their spending. In Q1 Groupon closed 17 countries and 2 JVs. An important part of the turnaround includes exiting the shopping businesses in Brazil and Japan. Management has indicated they will continue to close down international operations that are underperforming, but have not provided full details around which countries that includes, and when they would be shut down.It appears management has completed the first phase of the turnaround but there is still a long way to go. Several areas of continued improvement include:By the end of 2016 I believe Groupon will have approximately 26 million active users in North America, which compares to a population of approximately 200 million U.S. urban and suburban adults. Based on the size of the potential market I believe Groupon can continue to grow in North America.Based on the population stats above, I believe that improving marking efficiency can continue to drive new customer acquisition.The appointment of new CEO Rich Williams meant a new turnaround strategy compared to the previous strategy that relied on couponing and discounting, which only resulted in one-time benefits. Williams' strategy, by contrast, is focused on increasing marketing spend and efficiency of marketing dollars, which is a better long term strategy than couponing,In addition to improving marketing efforts it's critical that Groupon attract higher quality merchants. This will ultimately drive long term performance as at the end of the day I believe customer loyalty is only built by offering good products and services (as opposed to just the lowest price).Challenges to this strategy include take rates of 30- 40% on top of a 50% discounted service (hard for high quality business to want to offer their products at such low prices). Customer perception is very important to quality brands and Groupon is currently associated with heavy discounting, which may be undesirable to some brands. I point out these challenges, however, I believe Groupon can ""climb the wall"" and slowly improve the image of its brand in order to rely less heavily on discounting.Financial AnalysisI have built a turnaround model I believe supports a higher share price, which I will outline below.GRPN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsI expect revenue to continue to grow but at a low rate as growth from increased marketing is offset by less discounting.For 2016 I have taken management's guidance as a given, and have shown my own financial analysis for 2017-2020. This is how I have arrived at my own view of intrinsic value. Below are the details that makeup my analysis and support the buildup of my target price calculation. I believe there is a compelling opportunity to earn an attractive return on Groupon shares at current price levels.(source: analysis by author)As discussed above, revenue growth is driven by an expandable market in North America (primarily), modest growth in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), while the rest of the world will stay flat.Marketing will ramp up as discussed above and help support revenue growth at a higher gross margin.GRPN EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsGroupon has traded in an EV/EBITDA range with an average of about 10 times, and for the purposes of calculating my target price I have used a multiple of 8 times to be conservative.Based on a 2020 EBITDA target of $320 million multiplied by 8 times, I arrive at an enterprise value of $2,560 million, plus net cash of $800 million equates to an equity value of $3,360 million. With 575 million shares outstanding I calculate my target price of Groupon to be $5.80, or upside of 77%.While the Groupon turnaround story is still in its early days, I believe this analysis supports the long thesis for Groupon at current price levels. I plan to slowly build a position over the next few months by averaging in whenever I can get shares around $3.00."
3967724,101535,2016-04-25T11:24:11-04:00,"Management is trying to improve profitability.Stable revenue, but what about long-term profitability?Q1 results this Thursday will be crucial after the recent rally.","IntroductionGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) offers mobile and online marketplaces where consumers can discover and save on products and services while small businesses can attract and retain customers by offering deals. The vision is to connect local commerce and to increase consumer buying power.Groupon's annual sales in 2015 amounted to $3.1 billion and it employs 4,000 people around 28 countries where it has a presence. Revenue is categorized in three different segments: Groupon Local, Groupon Goods and Groupon getaways. In 2015, it derived 65.6% of the revenue from North America, 27.8% from EMEA and 6.6% from rest of the world.Source: Google Finance. Groupon's stock price since the IPO.PerformanceThe company's stock has declined significantly after the initial public offering. It is currently trading more than 85% under the all-time highs of $31.14. However, since the recent news that Alibaba Group took a stake in the company and better-than-anticipated Q4 results, it has recovered more than 100% from all-time lows of $2.15. Since 2011, the company has increased its revenue annually at a rate of 18%. Increased active customers grew from 33 to 49 million and now the company has a massive 650,000 active deals. But at the same time, the average customer spending has decreased from $187 in 2011 to $130 in 2015.Source: Groupon IRGroupon hasn't shown any stable profitability. In order to improve efficiency of the business, Groupon will narrow its focus to only key markets. The target is to restructure, streamline and divest. It has already disposed of controlling stakes in businesses that are located in India and Korea. In 2015, it also ceased operations in 13 international countries and are planning to exit another four this year. These divestitures are having an impact on the 2016 outlook; it is guiding revenue to be between $2.75 to $3.05 billion, so either little or clearly below 2015 figures. I have no problem in lower sales growth in the future if it is able to sustain profitability. It would certainly turn the negative perspective about the stock to more optimistic.Even with lackluster earnings, Groupon's balance sheet remains strong with little debt and positive cash flow from operations. It is using that balance sheet for a share repurchase program. It announced in 2015 a $500 million buyback program, which is in addition to the previously authorized $300 million. To date, it has repurchased $645 million in value and still has around $155 million left to use. For a Groupon-sized, $2.5 billion market cap company, the buyback is/was massive, yet the share count has been steady until recent quarters.Source: Groupon 10-K. Figures in thousands.TakeawayWhat separates Groupon from most of the other discount service providers is the fact that it's a household name. People are always looking ways to increase their buying power. In recent years when wage growth was modest, the obvious choice to find bargains was discount services. When there's economic slowdown, the demand for Groupon's services will most likely increase.The discount services business is easy to duplicate and the competition remains fierce. However, when Groupon exits the markets that aren't growing or showing profits, it can leverage the existing platform in key markets and possibly stay profitable longer. Another financial tailwind is that if the buyback program continues to eliminate the share count and there's no dilution from acquisitions, there might be rapid earnings per share improvements.ConclusionsThere's a lot of uncertainty at the moment and it's hard to evaluate Groupon. Revenues will decline this year, but how much? The efficiency improvements will include one-time expenses, but how much? For a reasonable 20 times earnings Nasdaq valuation, Groupon would have to produce net income of $133M or $0.22, which seems far-fetched for this year. I'm curious to see when it reports Q1 numbers this Thursday and if margins are starting to improve. I'm sitting this one out, waiting to see clear improvements before potentially buying."

The share price made a significant move following the announcement, but fell back a bit. It now hovers around $4 per share, higher than $2.50 near the time I forecasted outside interest in the company.Some analysts continue their relentless condemnations of Groupon's management and its business model. Others are more hopeful if not entirely positive. Divisiveness in the form of upgrades and downgrades is fostering volatility in share prices and in Groupon's recent market cap fluctuations from $4.9b up to $5.3b then reversing down to $2.3b. Yet, the company is not doomed; it's the analysts who are petulant, because the company has not lived up to its potential arguing ""Groupon could have been worth more.""Groupon is extant and expanding while competitor LivingSocial announced in March 2016 it is laying off more staff since its last cuts in October 2015. It suffers shrinking daily deals, has 20m followers, down from 50m at one time, and is trying to find legs as a shadow of its former self-focusing on restaurant deals.There is a lot of life left in Groupon, making it attractive to other companies discussed in my earlier article. Its most attractive assets remain a humongous user base, ability to keep attracting merchants, and knowledge from experience how to generate repeat users and enticing them to remain online longer searching Groupon's site.Economic doomsayer confrères are declaring America and Europe in the early throws of a recession or are soon to be in one. This opens the doors for the company according to one Motley Fool observer:Not much has changed since my November article that makes me change my mind. Groupon is a risky but an investment with good upside potential attractive below four dollars per share. It would not surprise me if the stock might double if larger companies want Groupon's millions of customers. Its greatest value is in spite of the naysayers the company keeps moving forward and progressing.Dr. Seuss might have had Groupon in mind when he wrote, ""Oh the things you can find, if you don't stay behind!"""

If you're thinking of buying the stock at its current level of $4.14 a share (in hopes that it may go to $7.35) be careful, because my read is that the market has already priced in a 100% buyout premium ($2.77 of enterprise value instead of $1.38).

Since Groupon's shares are publicly traded and the company is required to disclose certain business and financial information to the public, it was relatively easy for me to conclude that Groupon is worth $2.75 a share to a financial buyer. What we don't know is how valuable Groupon is to Alibaba.Why is Groupon important to Alibaba?The best analysis I've read on the subject comes from fellow Forbes Contributor Doug Young in Alibaba Eyeing Buyout Bid with Groupon Investment?

However, one short year later, the company announced it was selling 11 Main to rival marketplace OpenSky. At the time, Scot Wingo, Executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor (NYSE:ECOM), summed up the problem, ""11 Main never seemed to get much traction with either buyers or sellers."" After such a setback, I'm almost certain Alibaba's board wouldn't have a problem over-paying for Groupon if it meant it could control the third largest web-only retailer in the U.S (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) hold first and second place, respectively).Bottom LineAssuming Alibaba paid 54.0x EBITDA (same multiple QVC paid for Zulily) for Groupon, the market capitalization is $4.3 billion, which when divided by 584.49 million shares outstanding suggests a per share valuation of $7.35.

As I write this article, Groupon is trading for 2.72 which is a huge discount to its $20 2011 IPO price.Groupon profit is lacking, but execution is improvingI previously wrote about the how Groupon is executing terribly. It was spending much less on marketing, seemed to be focusing on the less lucrative goods business, but was missing things like customer reviews and the ability to sort products. While these issues have not all been resolved, there has been marked progress towards a more usable e-commerce experience.In my previous article I complained that marketing expenses had plummeted while SG&A had continued to grow. As of November 2015, Groupon has a new CEO, Rich Williams, who has pledged to spend $150 - $200 million in marketing. This increase in marketing represents almost doubling what they current spend. They also have announced that they are cutting 1,100 jobs which accounts for about 10% of their employee count. Take a look at this chart to see how dramatic the decrease in marketing expense has been.GRPN data by YChartsGroupon's ValueGroupon runs a terrific core business. They sell coupons to the customer that can be used for goods and services at local merchants and pay the business a percentage of the revenue taken in. Groupon's problem is that this business is not growing as evidenced by the chart showing their gross profit falling and gross margin being diluted by goods revenue.GRPN data by YChartsThe problem with growing that high margin local coupon business is that Groupon's take rate was too high and still is too high for many businesses. Groupon's average take rate was previously as high as 50% and has since fallen into the 35% range. For some high margin businesses this works.With take rates and marketing expenses coming down, it's very hard to show profit growth. For those looking longer term, a decrease in take rate is actually a good thing. They open themselves up to more businesses and make Groupon profitable for the local businesses they are selling for.Groupon's Big OpportunityIt's not hard to imagine Groupon behaving more like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The self service way to advertise your local business by offering special deals on products and services. SG&A should remain relatively flat or decrease. Groupon currently spends about 7% of North American revenue on advertising. The problem is only 40% is local business with ~85% gross margin and half is the goods business with ~13% gross margin. Even if all of the North America spend is driving local high margin business, it's easy to see that there is room to spend more to generate more incremental profit. The new CEO who joined Groupon as the Chief Marketing Officer understands that and has pledged to nearly double marketing spend with a return on investment within a year.... but that's not the big opportunity.There is no other company better positioned in mobile to do what Priceline (PCLN) did to travel with local businesses. Groupon shouldn't be selling just a way to save money. They should be upselling experiences that are not usually offered at each local business. Imagine a nationwide restaurant week with a few different price points for price-fixed meals. Imagine buying tickets to restaurants instead of making a reservation. No show rates decrease, customers are more happy and Groupon gets a bigger cut of the enormous local restaurant industry.I'm long Groupon, and will likely be buying more going into earnings. For the more risk adverse that still have long-term faith in Groupon, you can sell $2.50 Jan 2017 puts for $0.80."

The near-term competitive environment in the local deals space will further pressure local billing as GRPN aims to take more market share. In this space, GRPN's product offering lacks significant differentiation so a lower take rate is necessary to attract popular merchants. Additionally, near-term competitive pressure is escalading with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recently moving into the local market and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ramping up on its Google Offers. Although these two new threats have resulted in meaningful impact on the commission rate, I feel that it would be a matter of time before these two internet giants exert more pressure on GRPN's take-rate to gain a further foothold in the local ad space.The local ad market remains vastly underpenetrated relative to search, social media, or even online video, and this is one reason why large internet companies are moving into this space given its higher expected growth prospects. However, the local ad space also presents another challenge in that the customers, which consist of mostly SMEs, do not have a consistent budget on advertising and their average spend remains well below that of the national advertisers. For example, my contact who works at a national global ad company told me that average monthly spend for an ad package could be as low as $20/month to as high as $800/month. The unstable nature of the SME business also adds to that inconsistency. That said, I believe companies with deep local ties such as GRPN that has been in this space for an extended period, will continue to operate better than the larger players.The near-term spending on customer acquisition and restructuring of the international operations will be necessary for GRPN to get on the path to recovery. Last quarter clearly showed that customer growth on a q/q basis has stalled so investors can expect additional marketing spend to weigh in on profit. The new CEO Williams is expected to invest $150m - $200m in incremental marketing on customer acquisition and much of the market remains in a wait-and-see mode.Consensus expects flat EPS and $845m in revenue. Consensus expectations have been drastically reset over the past few quarters and at 18x FY17 EPS the stock looks reasonably attractive and there is minimal downside from this point on.As GRPN continues to invest in its platform and improve demand generation vs. supply push, several factors will make me more constructive on the shares. First, backing out of the unprofitable international market and/or asset sale of poor performing segments, second, margin improvement in the Goods segment by focusing more on profitability rather than scale, and finally, improving ROI from its latest marketing push.Conclusion, I am bullish on GRPN and see it to be a contender in North America's O2O space."
3895086,67313,2016-02-14T09:43:22-05:00,GRPN beat on Q4 and issued a positive 2016 outlook.Stability in its North America business is a key positive and should drive the stock higher.Remain bullish on the near-term growth outlook. Share price may have bottomed.,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) solid beat and bullish guidance underscores my view that the company remains one of the best positioned for the O2O trend that is gradually shaping up in North America. Overall, trends in North America remains healthy and the additional color on marketing spend was very constructive. Increased efficiency in Goods is a positive given the highly promotional holiday period. In short, stability is certainly there and I think the stock has found support at the current level after down over 70% in the past year.I continue to be bullish on GRPN and see two positive catalysts for the stock. First, ongoing stability and growing O2O trends will continue to support the company's near-term growth outlook. Second, industry consolidation will continue to favor GRPN either as an acquirer or a target. With Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) showing increasing interest in the local deal space, GRPN is an attractive target due to its solid industry standing.Revenue of $917m, flat y/y and EPS of $0.04 both were ahead of consensus. More important, guidance of $2.75b-$3.05b for 2016E guidance was within expectations and the company now is guiding $80-$130m in EBITDA. Overall the quarter was very solid with FX-neutral local billing +7% y/y and this growth profile is expected to remain steady in the next several quarters before accelerating in late 2016. North America continues to gain traction with local revenue +8% on the back of a +44bps take-rate increase. Although EMEA and RoW operations continue to see persistent headwinds, streamlining the overseas operation via asset sale or exit will be fundamental to GRPN's long-term profitability.Management provided additional color on marketing spend, which I think is constructive for the market to have realistic expectation of the company's spending going forward. In the quarter, $61m was spent on consumer marketing, a +$25m sequential increase, and most of them are centered on North America. The budget was spread across SEM, apps, subsidies, offline and display ads, and given the competitive nature and the fragmentation of the market, we can see higher marketing spend this year as GRPN look to squeeze out the smaller rivals and gain further foothold in the local deals space. Although some investors may be relieved to see the decline in discounts, it is worth reminding that GRPN can switch on the lever given how competitive the market can turn out.Bottom line is that GRPN's Q4 was very positive and the bullish outlook is exactly what the market needs after the decline in the stock over the past year. The stability in North America will give the market some comfort on its growth outlook and I continue to view GRPN to be a leader in the on-demand, local deal market. In short, I believe the local deal space is only the surface of what GRPN can accomplish given its scale and market penetration. Future potential includes on-demand services, delivery and broader scope, all of which will be accretive to its growth outlook. I remain bullish on the stock."
3909116,24427,2016-02-18T18:08:09-05:00,"Alibaba disclosed this week that it has purchased about 33 million shares or a 5.6% stake in Groupon.The market values GRPN's active customers at $32 each versus $372 for BABA's active customers, even though net revenue per GRPN customer is 75% higher.GRPN trades at a discount to both its own likely customer acquisition replacement cost and typical industry customer acquisition costs.BABA’s higher price/sales multiple allows BABA plenty of room to make GRPN's customers accretive to value if they can bring them into the BABA ecosystem.GRPN’s latest earnings release indicates improved operating performance, which together with its discount to typical customer acquisition costs makes GRPN cheap even in the absence of any potential BABA synergy.","Customer acquisition costs (""CAC"") are not cheapSince this story is all about CAC, let me start with a quick overview on how expensive CAC can be, so that you can appreciate the value of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) active - and dormant - customer base. While costs vary by industry and statistics are hard to come by, the following examples will provide perspective:The takeaway from these examples is that getting new ""paying"" customers online is expensive. The norm seems like $50 to $100 per active paying customer.Groupon currently has about 50 million active customers. They also have 110 million people who have downloaded their app. That means there are an additional 60 million dormant customers who have downloaded the app but are not currently active - so probably some value there too. To replace only the active customers at today's cost of say $60 per customer would cost GRPN $3 billion, which is about double its current enterprise value.GRPN marketing spend is primarily an investment, not an expenseGRPN has invested almost $1bn in marketing in the last four years. GRPN expenses this item, but you could argue that a large part of it really should be capitalized and amortized, since it is an investment in an asset that will deliver revenue over time. For perspective, their enterprise value is 62.5% above their aggregate marketing spend for the past four years.Comparing key metrics between GRPN and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)Their business models are similar since both operate online and mobile commerce marketplaces that connect merchants to consumers. However, there is a huge discrepancy between the value that the stock market gives to a BABA customer versus a GRPN customer, based on any value to revenue metric selected. Granted, a BABA customer spends on average three times a GRPN customer per year, but GRPN has a higher net revenue per customer. The circled number tells it best - based on the enterprise value per active customer, the market values a BABA customer at 11.7 times the value it gives to a GRPN customer. BABA's higher multiple is like cheap currency when buying GRPN stock.The reason the market gives BABA this premium is because its growth rate is much higher than GRPN. Here is a chart showing BABA's growth in active customers.It's an impressive growth story, but the rate of growth is actually slowing, which is to be expected when you get up to 400 million customers. There are only about 3 billion internet users in the world, and logically, bringing on incremental customers will become more expensive as the pool of potential untapped customers gets smaller.Alibaba's motiveThere is much speculation on BABA's motive for acquiring 5.6% of GRPN common stock, perhaps to compete better with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but as reported by The Street, it's a passive investment to exchange ideas. ""We bought a very small minority stake in Groupon in order to share ideas between U.S. and China markets in a space... This is a passive holding, and if Groupon management would like to exchange experiences with us, we are prepared to share,"" said Robert Christie, vice president of Alibaba's international media relations.While that is somewhat vague, the point is that if BABA can somehow bring GRPN customers into their ecosystem, it represents an extremely cheap way of acquiring new customers at a time when their growth rate is slowing, and the market will reward them instantly for it, given the higher multiple of revenue BABA trades at. For this reason, they can afford to pay a significant premium for GRPN and still have it be accretive to their share price.Improved operating metrics, stock buybacks and positive guidanceGRPN's Q4 earnings report showed generally positive trends, with free cash flow of $208 million for the trailing twelve months - 12% of enterprise value. They also have been buying back their own stock in large amounts.From their earnings release, ""2015 saw sustained progress toward our vision of making Groupon the daily habit in local commerce,"" said CEO Rich Williams. ""Following a stronger than expected fourth quarter, we enter 2016 with a continued focus on streamlining our global operations, reducing our reliance on low margin products in our shopping business and rekindling our customer acquisition efforts to set the stage for accelerated growth.""ConclusionThe low price per active customer and improving operational metrics make GRPN a reasonable buy at this price with asymmetric upside if potential BABA symmetries materialize."
3963369,50682,2016-04-05T16:41:47-04:00,,"Bottom line: Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) new tie-up with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) shows it's more interested in working with a well-known US-based company than the unfamiliar Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which could force Alibaba to quietly dump its Groupon stake by the end of this year.It seems e-commerce giant Alibaba isn't the only company interested in money-losing group buying site Groupon. Less than 2 months after Alibaba disclosed it had purchased 5 percent of Groupon shares, apparently in the open market, a firm backed by US cable giant Comcast has just announced plans for its own strategic tie-up with the faded group buying site.This new move certainly seems to throw some doubt on my previous prediction that Alibaba's purchase could presage a boosting of its stake in Groupon, or perhaps even an outright buyout bid. While such a move is still possible, Groupon does seem to be signaling that it intends to remain independent. It also seems to be indicating it prefers this more direct approach to forming new partnerships, rather than Alibaba's approach that looks a bit stealthier since it appeared to buy its Groupon shares without the company's consent.Alibaba's earlier move always looked a bit strange, since it's relatively uncommon for one company to acquire a strategic stake of another by purchasing shares in the open market. Such a move would normally look hostile, since such stake acquisitions occur without consent of the company whose shares are being purchased.By comparison, this latest deal between Groupon and Comcast-backed Atairos was announced by Groupon itself, and was clearly the result of talks between both companies. Under the deal, Atairos will invest $250 million to buy Groupon-issued bonds, which it can convert to stock by 2022 at a price of $5.40 per share. (company announcement; English article; Chinese article)That price represents a 38 percent premium over Groupon's last close before the announcement. Groupon shares rallied 9.5 percent after the latest announcement, and are now nearly double the levels they were at when Alibaba first disclosed its purchase in a regulatory filing in February. Based on my own calculations, the deal would give Comcast nearly 8 percent of Groupon's stock if it decides to convert the shares later.Mutual ConsentGroupon and Atairos were quite explicit in saying the investment was part of a broader tie-up that would see the pair explore potential partnerships. In this case, there certainly does seem to be lots of space for tie-ups. That's because Groupon works closely with many US retailers to sell their goods to US consumers. Comcast also has a close relationship with many of those same consumers through its position as a leading provider of cable TV and other on-demand services into people's homes.By comparison, it was never really clear what kinds of tie-ups Groupon might be able to forge with Alibaba, which operates several hugely popular e-commerce platforms in China. It's possible Groupon could have offered some of its products to Alibaba's China users, though logistics of international shipping would have made that kind cooperation difficult and not very lucrative.This particular development also seems to show that western companies probably feel more comfortable working with partners from their home markets, rather than strangers like Alibaba that have lots of money but are far less adept at forming such partnerships. Such dynamics were at play over the last month when hotel operator Starwood (HOT) chose to be purchased by larger US rival Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) despite getting a higher offer from unfamiliar Chinese insurance giant Anbang (previous post).Alibaba said when it disclosed its Groupon acquisition that it wanted to enter talks to explore possible partnerships, though it's unclear if any talks have occurred since then. It's certainly not impossible to have 2 or more strategic partners, and there's nothing to stop Groupon from pursuing a separate tie-up with Alibaba. But this latest move appears to show that Groupon is more interested in working with more familiar partners like Comcast, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Alibaba quietly abandon its Groupon pursuit and sell its stake in the company by the end of this year.Disclosure: None"

Why? I have noticed that many small companies have become active in online marketing and offer deals on their own. They can do without Groupon. And I do not have to waste my time going to Groupon's website to find deals - I can simply check a company's website or page on the social network and see what discounts it currently offers. It seems to me that, as people become more and more Internet-literate, they will need services of middlemen like Groupon less and less.In the meantime, Groupon has managed to double its sales over the last three years:(Source: ​Google Finance)However, this has been done at the expense of profits:(Source: Google Finance)Fiscal 2015 has been stagnant - the last 12-month data show that it will likely deliver revenues in the neighborhood of $3.2B - $3.3B, the same as during the year before. The company still generates positive free cash flows but the gap between operating cash flows and capex has been continually narrowing. As the share price falters, Groupon uses cash to buy back shares: the company has spent $37.5M to buy back stock in 2013, $147M in 2014, and over $320M in the first nine months of 2015. Unfortunately, this did not help the stock much:(Source: Bloomberg)​I have noticed something interesting in the options market for this stock. In particular, I have looked into the options expiring a year from now, in January 2017.

3777696,24663,2015-12-27T18:02:08-05:00,"One chart shows why GRPN is starting to go higher.GRPN is not a great company, but established nonetheless.2016 could be a good year for GRPN.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock may have fallen 87% over the last five years, but currently GRPN is about 30% above its 52-week lows. The instances where GRPN has traded this far from 52-week lows are far and few between in recent memory. However, there is one chart that I think explains the favorable trading pattern of GRPN over the last month and why GRPN's strong finish to 2015 will carry over to 2016.GRPN Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsWhile Groupon's stock performance has been horrid, its multiple to free cash flow has decreased at an even faster rate than stock losses. In other words, GRPN is very cheap at less than 11x FCF, and that's the simple reason why it's trending higher right now. When you compare Groupon's valuation multiple to the near 60x multiple for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, investors see that buying GRPN is a low-risk, potentially high-reward investment opportunity.Groupon has new leadership with Rich Williams, is vowing to cut costs with higher profit goods, and has made lots of high-level management changes since announcing third quarter earnings. These things serve as catalysts for 2016.With that said, GRPN has a great shot to carry over its end-of-year momentum into 2016. Not only is the stock cheap, with the catalysts previously mentioned, but its Groupon Goods business continues to perform quite well. While Groupon Goods does have lower margins, there is the potential for margin expansion with a change in product assortment and if Groupon can streamline its international business. Then, the high single-digit, low double-digit growth of Groupon Goods becomes a stock catalyst.Nevertheless, GRPN has been in turmoil since Day 1 after going public, which includes countless management shakeups, disappointing sales performance and crashing margins. This has not been a great company, and in retrospect, it's still not a great company. However, with $3.24 billion in 12-month revenue, and Groupon Goods still a growing business, Groupon is a legitimate company.Fact is that investors were not willing to pay 50 or 100 times FCF once growth decelerated, margins crashed and management shakeups started to happen by the quarter. However, at less than 11 times FCF, the price might very well be right for GRPN stock to keep going higher in 2016."
3898776,22445,2016-02-16T13:06:47-05:00,"While the recent quarter of Groupon was nothing to cheer about, it managed to change the perception of the stock in the eyes of the market.Groupon is an extremely beaten down stock and trades at a very depressed Price/Sales ratio of almost 1/2.Coupled with the fact that shares outstanding have been reduced by about 10%, and that about 20% of the float is sold short, the stock could double fast.","Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) quarterly results were not that spectacular to warrant a 30% pop in the stock. What was great about them however, is that they changed the perception the market has of the stock.Because when everyone has been expecting you to fade away, or even go out of business, or become irrelevant, and then perception changes (coupled with the fact that about 20% of your float is sold short), then a 30% pop is in order.A turn around company in progressAs per the company's Q4 and full year results, revenue for Q4 was $917.2 million compared to $883.2 million in Q4 of 2014. That's a 4% increase and a 9% increase on a FX neutral basis. While it is positive, it's also nothing to get excited about in my book. What was a big positive was that on a FX neutral basis, revenue in North America increased by 13%.Gross profit for the quarter was $371.7 million, compared to $378.1 million in Q4 of 2014. While gross profit declined 2% globally, it grew 4% on a FX neutral basis. Again, nothing to get excited about.For the full year of 2015, gross billings were $6.3 billion, and revenue $3.1 billion, compared to $6.2 billion and $3 billion for 2014. Again, nothing to be excited about outside of the fact that on a FX neutral basis, things were a little better.And guidance for the full year 2016 calls for revenue between $2.75 and $3.05 billion, with only adjusted EBITDA increasing between $80 and $130 million. Again nothing to scream about.The bottom line is that there was not much in the headline numbers that got anyone excited.So why did the stock pop 30%?The company reported earnings of $0.04 per share, when analysts were expecting an adjusted loss of $0.05 per share. That's a very big surprise if you ask me. Also, revenue of $917.2 million topped forecasts of $845.9 million.CEO Rich Williams, said the company is entering 2016 with a ""continued focus on streamlining global operations"", reducing reliance on low margin products in the shopping business, and rekindling customer acquisition efforts to set the stage for accelerated growth.Part of that ""streamlining"" was exiting 19 countries for all of 2015. The company now operates in 28 countries, and its footprint is very close to where it wants to be long-term. I assume that means the company might exit more markets if needed in the future.Active customers increased modestly to 48.9 million. This despite that fact that the company has exited so many markets. In other words, in real terms customer growth was higher. The company added 645,000 active customers during the last quarter. The most in five quarters.However, the best part of the quarter, and the ""streamlining"" process, is that it yielded higher growth in the Americas. And the reason this is good is because that's where the higher margins are. As a result, the company expects margins to rise even more in 2016.In EMEA, the company returned to profitability as a result of its restructuring and ""streamlining"" efforts. And even though the company stated that international local gross billings growth continues to be a challenge, it believes it is one to two years behind North America in their migration of the marketplace model. While no immediate benefit will come of this, it is something to look forward to in the future.In other words, the company has gotten its act together on many fronts (please read the quarterly report for more info).As a result of all the above, perception has changed at how investors view the stock. Also investors now have something to look forward to, even if guidance for 2016 is nothing to cheer about.So why do I think Groupon is going to double?Exhibit number 1 - Depressed ValuationGRPN is trading at extreme depressed levels. And by depressed, I do not mean that it has deflated from $26 to $2.20 a share. By depressed I mean it is only trading at 1/2 X revenue, or a Price/Sales ratio of about 0.50:GRPN PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsInvestors buying GRPN today are paying a fraction for the company compared to what investors were paying a few years back. And if you say to me, ""but I was paying for growth"", my answer is that you were overpaying for growth.Today the company is trading for almost scrap. In fact, I don't know if I can find another Internet based company that trades for about 1/2 times revenue (I mean there might be one out there, but I have not found it yet).I am not looking for GRPN to trade at some crazy multiple like many other stocks in the space do. I am only looking to see the market cap at 1X revenue. If this happens, then the stock could double from current prices.Exhibit number 2 - Shares outstanding shrinkingI don't think many investors realized it, but over the past several quarters, shares outstanding have been reduced by almost 10% . That's a very big number folks.GRPN Shares Outstanding data by YChartsAnd sooner or later (probably sooner), this reduction in the float, coupled with perception change, will act like a levered gear and push the stock to much higher levels than we could probably imagine. The 30% pop on Friday is just the beginning if you ask me.Exhibit number 3 - The technical pictureInvestors are like a pack of wolves. When they see blood somewhere or profit, they attack in hoards.Many institutional and individual investors pay a lot of attention to support and resistance levels. When a resistance level breaks to the upside, then program trading algorithms - as well as technical traders who trade on partners - jump at a stock.My guess is that when GRPN takes out the $3.4 resistance level, we will see the first big wave of money betting on GRPN. And when the $4 mark is taken out, I think we will see the first longer term minded money taking a position.And if the company does well and we see analysts upgrade the stock, then I also think GRPN will take out the $5.30 mark, and we will see even more money pouring into the stock. If so, my longer term target of around $8 a share will probably be reached over the next 2 years or so.Bottom linePlease note that GRPN is coming from $26 a share. While the market should have never priced it that high to begin with, today at $3 a share the stock is trading at a very depressed valuation.While GRPN is not a high growth company today, the fact that it is trading at such depressed levels leaves room for profit. Simply put, its Price/Sales ratio for an Internet company is just too low.Even with no growth, the stock should not be trading at anything less than 1X revenue, which leaves room for a profit of about 100% from current levels.To the extent that the company keeps repurchasing shares, and shows signs of growth in the future, that will further propel its shares.While my $6 price target has a 12-month horizon, it is possible that we might see an even higher number, if the company surprises during a future quarterly report.Any way I look at it, GRPN is a 2 bagger in my book until further notice."

Additionally, Jacob Hawkins is now head of North American goods and Sri Viswanath is now out as CTO starting January 1. Aaron Cooper was named head of North American services, which is interesting as this is the best performing segment for Groupon.The key takeaway is big changes are taking place in Groupon's management, but not yet in the core platform. This is all coming after Rich Williams became CEO a month ago. Shareholders are counting on him to restore focus to Groupon's business model. Everything I'm reading about the top dog sounds like he's on the right track, but again, it's just media coverage and could be false hope - only the statistics on the Q4 ER really matter now. What I'd really like to see on the earnings call following the report is that the company is focused on international growth but is pulling out of markets it just isn't competitive in right now, rather than burning cash to pursue long shots.Hope For Local E-Commerce?If we take a look at the current retail environment, projections for the holiday season are interesting as only moderate growth is projected. While consumers are favored with the increasing amount of discounted deals amid rising competition from online retailers, we have to wonder how this translates to Groupon.Perhaps Black Friday tells a different story. With $3.07 billion spent online, with 26% of that amount coming from mobile, we saw a 16% increase in spending YOY, which is an excellent sign that Groupon could be the beneficiary of that growth. We saw Rich Williams indicate that North American billings were up 41% for the four-day spending weekend, which is a great start to his tenure as CEO.While the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend is usually used as an indicator of December sales, last year we saw December 23 surpass Black Friday in sales, so our predictions are decreasing. Furthermore, Groupon To Go is facing increasing competition as startups are eating away marginally at the large players in the industry. The company's acquisition of OrderUp looks like nothing more than a waste of cash at this point, as Uber Eats, Deliveroo and GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) are all making extensive movies in strategy to push away competitors. I'd expect this portion of the company's revenues to lag during the holiday season.An Acqusition Soon?Recall that Google/Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) tried to buy the company back in 2010 for $6 billion back when Andrew Mason was CEO. The team made a miscalculation as they thought gross revenues would grow by the billions in the years to follow, which would value the company well over a measly $6 billion. Furthermore, the $800 million breakup fee was meager.With Lefkofsky now stepping down and Rich Williams taking the reigns, along with all of the other management shakeups, it's looking less likely that an acquisition will occur in the next couple of months. I mean, why go to all of the trouble with the new restructuring costs? Regardless, let's look at what Groupon has to offer. They have:Even at a generous premium of 20% over the equity value, this company would be bought out at $2.12 billion. If this company remains its own cohesive unit, the insider selling has to stop. What's potentially even more concerning is that there have been zero buys from management in the last three months. This is sending shareholders the wrong message. Furthermore, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Local exiting the local e-commerce space last month, potential buyers may be hesitant to try and invest in an industry that has question marks attached to it.Is Now The Time To Enter?The stock is currently well below its moving averages, trading at $2.86 as of Monday's close. You can see the sharp drop after the Q3 report, followed by a few more sessions of declines, and now a crater in the chart has formed. The stock is relatively flat on the RSI, and volumes are remaining relatively average after the Q3 ER. Below you can see the short opportunity that started months and months ago:Source: StockChartsI'm continually reminded that the comps are going to be easier in Q4 and next year for this company to beat. But with the management shakeup, all the weight is on their shoulders. Being positive on the bottom line, above -$21.21 million for Q4 is key. The company is trending toward positive FCF outside of the holiday season bump (last Q4 was $266.94 million), as well as positive OCF, as Q3 showed -$31.37 million. These are not difficult comps for the company to beat based upon past financials, but it all depends upon where the bar is set by analysts and whether these targets are raised or reduced. The turnaround effort is going to be clearly defined in these financials as we move forward and could bring a lot of unwanted or non-factored costs, which is worth considering when making a play on the stock.Another interesting note is that given this company's strong YTD downtrend of 65.38%, the January Effect, whereby stocks sell off in December and regain in January for the tax benefit, may occur with Groupon. I'd watch volumes closely as we move toward the close of the calendar year.ConclusionYou buy the stock if you're speculating that a potential acquisition is going to occur. It's relatively cheap at just a few dollars a share, lending itself to being a decent technical trade given its high average volume for a stock so lowly priced, but it's very risky at current levels. You sell the stock or even short it if you continue to not believe in the business model and do not believe it becomes an acquisition target. Take your pick, but I'm staying away."
3667536,62873,2015-11-09T15:01:00-05:00,"The technical data are wicked but fundamental analyses makes Groupon a buyout or takeover dream opportunity.Conditions satisfy every Peter Drucker requirement for an M&A - where else can you pick up a $700m per quarter revenues tech company in consumer retailing at a premium?New management, leadership, planning and resources from a compatible tech company will make this one of the turnaround stories in business: it's imagination that rules the world.","This is one assessor's take on Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) wretched reputation in the investment community compounded by wicked Q3 financials. They are so shocking the board and persuasive investors were forced within hours of public release to exercise long overdue fiduciary responsibility and remove the co-founder and CEO. Nevertheless the Q3 financials are another shock to believers in Groupon's mission. Those data need not be repeated, because they do not tell the story of this company's true potential value.There are plenty of other reports using technical data analyses giving rise to the wailing keeners. I believe fundamental analyses of other conditions suggest the company is prime for a buyout or takeover where patient investors can recoup much of our money if not turn a profit. Furthermore, the Q3 financials lead me to believe it is a good time for investors with high conviction and risk tolerance to buy the stock and I'm putting my money behind that bet.Other fed up and frothing analysts are avoiding any buys of Groupon stock in the near term. One analyst called the Q3 financials the worst earnings report with terrible operating numbers, flat user growth, revenue troubles and no real earnings. Capital was siphoned off from pursuing more acquisitions for the buybacks and marketing not yielding enough return on investment. Guidance for Q4 does not look better and lower for 2016.The hopelessness and negativity are all about Groupon's management and the board's appearance of insouciance. The frustration is so pervasive that the 31% free fall of share price was not abated even with the announcement about the CEO's replacement. Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPE) fared better when Carly Fiorina was let go - the stock rose 6.9% on that announcement.The man the board fired is now chairman of the board. His replacement has been COO for nearly a half-decade. Rich Williams is not being held accountable for his part in the failed planning and execution of Groupon's business model. Groupon is merely offering the public an appearance of change at the top when there really isn't any.The fogdog for investors are the conditions that make GRPN a buyout or takeover target if you apply the Peter Drucker playbook of successful acquisitions.Other fundamental analyses add traction to the conviction that the time is ripe for a buyout or takeover. Groupon despite missing targets remains ""the player"" in consumer technology increasing consumer-buying power driving more business to local merchants through price. We know with social media there are fundamental changes taking place in the economy for how consumers shop and Groupon is at the cutting edge.There is no close second despite attempts by a plethora of other companies trying to unseat GRPN. Q3 gross billings hit $1.47 billion, revenue $714m and TTM free cash flow $228m. Groupon has nearly 50m active customers spending on average $148. Online searches and active deals are both up. Standing alone without comparisons Groupon remains a behemoth in its market segment with brand awareness topping 80% in North America. Better planning, management, execution and investment in marketing in its strongest markets can bring more growth and prosperity.Groupon is a cheaper buy now than in 2010 when Google offered $6b. On the plus side it brings a more valuable customer base and brand name among consumers than back then. BloombergBusiness estimated on April 12, 2015 (the stock was trading at about $7 per share), that Groupon's market value was $6b. It has $1b in cash and can raise more than $700m through divestments for e-commerce market expansion. It has few competitors seriously threatening Groupon's market share especially with the announcement that Amazon Local is shutting down. It is the 60th most visited site in the U.S. with each visitor viewing nearly four pages and spending more than four minutes on the site. 15,000 other sites link to groupon.com.Academic research points to the fact mergers come in waves, and America is experiencing one of its greatest M&A waves in nearly a decade. (here)Source: copyright Dealogic (here)The environment is ripe with mergers and acquisitions picking up and companies hoarding cash looking for opportunities. Dealogic reports $4 trillion in deals were done this year at the fastest pace on record with technology the most targeted sector. The recent Global Confidence Barometer says the climate is right. Most companies surveyed are ""expecting to actively pursue acquisitions in the next 12 months"" especially in the consumer products and retail sector (67%) to help top line revenue growth - ust what Groupon needs.Groupon's market cap today is $2b. Groupon might pull a $3.5b-$4b offer on a good day. There is no upside to buying the stock under present management unless you are willing to bet Groupon is a buyout or takeover target. However, new ownership, management, leadership, planning and resources from a compatible tech company will make this one of the turnaround stories in business. Like Napoleon said, it's imagination that rules the world. I am willing to make that bet."
3641186,24849,2015-11-03T20:20:46-05:00,"Q3 revenues missed, guidance awful.Company replacing CEO.Buyback not working at significantly higher prices.","We have a new candidate for the worst earnings report of the quarter, and this nomination goes to Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). The daily deals site announced another ugly quarter, gave terrible guidance for Q4, and detailed an executive transition. With results continuing to disappoint, shares hit another new low in the after-hours session.Q3 revenues came in at $713.6 million, nearly $20 million below the analyst average for the quarter. For Q4, management called for revenues of $815 million to $865 million, well below analysts' estimates of $957 million. The lowest estimate on the Street was for $900 million. The company also guided to non-GAAP EPS of one penny at best while analysts were looking for a 7-cent profit.Management stated that its guidance reflects increased investments in marketing, and given revenue issues, this would seem to make sense. However, Groupon has already reported terrible operating income numbers this year, so this only stands to increase the overall losses for the firm. Take a look at the table below showing the company's two largest revenue geographies, and note my red boxes showing the dramatic drop in operating income, especially for the North American segment that represents almost 2/3 of revenues:(Source: Company earnings slides)Through the first nine months of 2015, the company reported a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $56.6 million, up from $45 million in the prior-year period. With revenues struggling and now the company spending even more on marketing, how is this business going to make money? Even if you look at the non-GAAP numbers, the stock currently trades for about 30 times expected 2016 EPS. I can't recommend paying that much for a stock with revenue troubles and no real earnings.My biggest worry is that the company just doesn't know where to invest right now. Through the first nine months of 2015, the company has spent over $334 million to repurchase shares at an average price of about $5.07. In the after-hours trading on Tuesday, shares were below $3 a share. Instead of buying back shares, Groupon probably needs to make more acquisitions, as the buyback obviously has not done a good job of supporting its shares. As seen in the chart below, shares had jumped over their 50-day moving average right before earnings. However, this post-earnings fall will send the 50-day further lower, adding more technical pressure to the downside.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Groupon also continued its large executive transition, naming COO Rich Williams its new CEO. It was just five months ago that Williams, the company's North American Chief, was appointed to the newly created COO role. Groupon's CFO also left at that time. The company stated how outgoing CEO Eric Lefkofsky helped increase revenues by 32% in the past two years, but the stock has lost 70% in the past two years when you include the after-hours fall.Another item that worries me is that we had seen a large decline in short interest over the prior two months, ending mid-October, and I think some of the recent rally probably meant even more shorts covered into early November. With short interest under 15% in mid-October, we could see a massive rise in shares short, adding significant pressure to a stock already at its 52-week low. With Groupon averaging less than 6 million shares traded daily over the past three months, imagine how much selling pressure could come in if shorts increased by 40 or 50 million shares.Investors in Groupon need to hope that the company gave the quarter kitchen sink treatment, sandbagging guidance to set up a beat down the road. The buyback will become even more powerful at less than $3 a share, but the company needs to get its revenue and profit situation back on track. Q4 investments may take time to pay off, and investors are clearly not satisfied with where the name stands currently. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently dumped its daily deals service, and there have been many job cuts in this space recently. Investors would be best off avoiding this name for the near term until we see the revenue situation stabilize."
3642206,74295,2015-11-04T01:36:25-05:00,"After reporting Q3 earnings Tuesday, Groupon's stock price is being pummeled.Mixed results, the departure of CEO Eric Lefkofsky and horrid guidance are the likely culprits.Groupon is damaged goods for now.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported Q3 earnings Tuesday and the results weren't pretty. Shareholders were treated to a mixed quarter, the news of further executive shake-up and terrible guidance for the coming quarter, and were understandably disappointed. The stock fell 25% after-hours and adds yet more carnage to an abysmal year for GRPN's share price. The stock is down a bit more than 50% year-to-date and nor was 2014 a kind year to GRPN shareholders.(Groupon Logo)Did the earnings results really warrant such a big drop? In my opinion, yes. But I'll give a brief overview of the numbers and let you be the judge:These metrics were not bad. Revenue didn't miss by much and EPS, free cash flow and gross margin all looked healthy in the quarter. The major issue was guidance. Management guided for Q4 revenues of between $815 and $865 million and EPS of between -$0.01 and $0.01. This is a far cry from the consensus estimate of $956.8 million in revenue and $0.07 in EPS for Q4.GRPN was and still is trading at a premium valuation, and investors will only continue to pay a premium for a traditionally overvalued company if it continues to grow at a robust rate. Nothing hammers speculative stocks harder than missing estimates. And this wasn't your garden-variety miss; even if Q4 revenue comes in at the high end of guidance, it will still miss the consensus estimate by nearly 10%.Okay, so GRPN deserved the beating. But is the stock worth taking a look at now? I write articles for a recurring segment called ""Buy on the Drop?"" where I look at stocks that have recently lost significant value and recommend them to readers (you can check out my past articles to read some of these pieces). I love catching falling knives. However, GRPN still seems to have a lot of room for further downside and investors should be wary of this trap masquerading as a potentially lucrative buying opportunity.Even at $3, which is about where the stock ended after-hours, GRPN's forward P/E is 16.05, and estimates are sure to fall precipitously after they are revised to take into account the guidance management issued. Therefore, even at $3, shares are not undervalued according to traditional metrics. Shares will also not sustain a premium valuation if the company cannot supply reasonably impressive revenue and earnings growth going forward. And as Q4 guidance shows, these two things are faltering. The company's Q4 2014 revenue was $925 million, and if revenue for Q4 2015 comes at the high end of guidance that will represent a 6.5% year-over-year decrease.New CEO Rich Williams stated that he has plans to invest in new customer acquisition, cut costs and streamline the company's international operations and shift business away from lower-margin areas towards high-margin ones. Of those three points, I think the first is of the utmost importance. Cutting costs and boosting margins is fine, but revenue is what drives a business. It is for this reason that my biggest concern regarding Groupon right now is its stagnant revenue and billings growth.There are a few ways Groupon could go about doing this, but I'll focus on the two main ones: Investment in new customer acquisition and M&A. The former will mostly manifest in the form of operating expenses and the latter would be taken out of the company's cash pile. Rich Williams seems to be electing to go with option number one for now, but I think M&A should also be considered. It would definitely be a much better use of cash!The company's current share repurchase plan has done nothing to boost shareholder value or EPS. Revenues are suffering and shareholders are anxious. M&A would be a good solution to this dilemma because acquisitions would be incremental to revenue and earnings, which would benefit the share price and overall investor value in the long-run. I'm sure shareholders would prefer that Groupon use its cash for incremental acquisitions rather than for share buybacks that are completely ineffective.It will be interesting to see how the executives handle the situation with Lefkofsky out and I think the key to success will be getting revenue and EPS growth back on track. In my opinion M&A would be a good way to go about accomplishing this, but investing in new customer acquisition is also a smart move. Regardless, it appears the GRPN is in for a rough going in the near-term. The long-term picture still seems for the most part uncertain.Despite all the negatives, there is still the possibility of future upside. The company has $963 million as of the end of Q3, virtually no debt, a commitment to return value to shareholders and healthy free cash flow. This could translate into GRPN having a lot of room to run if it can get revenue and earnings back on track in the next few quarters. However, that is a big ""if"". Until the picture changes, GRPN is damaged goods.Closing ThoughtsGroupon did not have a good showing in Q3 and the stock was punished. Stagnant revenue and earnings growth are in the spotlight and will be the thing to keep an eye on going forward. The company is financially solid, but is overvalued according to traditional valuation metrics. For GRPN to be a buy again, the company has to pick up the pace in the growth department. Q4 will be an important quarter to watch."
3644006,67313,2015-11-04T10:51:40-05:00,GRPN's Q3 highlights ongoing challenges in North America and international markets.Local billing continues to be pressured by a lower take rate while marketplace continues to drive take rate expansion.At 17x next year's earnings the stock is a steal at the current level given its leadership in the O2O space.,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) Q3 earnings continue to highlight the ongoing challenges the company faces in both revenue and user growth. Although the exits made by competitors in the local deal market will ultimately be a positive, it will take several quarters for GRPN to see meaningful recovery and revenue acceleration. Additionally, the change in CEO added more uncertainties involving the company and the investment community will likely to take a wait-and-see approach on the stock. Despite the near-term challenges, I continue to see GRPN to be the preferred local deal site in North America and a key beneficiary of the O2O trend that is bound to materialize once the mobile payment equation becomes more certain.I will use the correction post earnings as a buying opportunity. At $3.00 per share, the stock trades at 17x 2016E earnings. In some way, GRPN is becoming more a value stock for those who believe in the O2O trend. Worth reminding investors that judging by the valuation of Meituan-Dianping in China, which is estimated to be $15b, GRPN's current valuation discount is unjustified, in my view (see Alibaba And Tencent: Creating The O2O Powerhouse).Consolidated revenue of $714m, -6% y/y, missed consensus by $19m while EPS of $0.05 beat. The weak revenue was negatively impacted by FX. When we exclude FX, revenue would have grown by 7% y/y, with North America growing at 11% and the rest of the world flat. Outlook was weak with $815-865m in revenue and breakeven EPS, which were lower than consensus $957m in revenue and $0.07 in EPS.Looking at the operating metrics, GRPN's quarter was a mixed bag but there were encouraging signs such as the FX-adjusted gross billing increase of 6% and a moderate improvement in take rate. This comes after the company announced a 10% workforce reduction with some sales. Local billing declined 4% to $757m and evidence of heavy promotion was apparent with a lower take rate that resulted in a 10% decline in net revenue. Travel billing modestly declined by 1% to $197m with a lower take rate pulling revenue back by 2%. On the other hand, goods billings increased 2% with revenue up +8%, suggesting an improving take rate on the high margin products.In my view, the near-term competitive environment in the local deals space will further pressure local billing as GRPN aims to take more market share. In this space, GRPN's product offering lacks significant differentiation so a lower take rate is necessary to attract the popular merchants. However, GRPN differentiates in the marketplace with the scale that not many can match, thereby allowing this segment to deliver an above-average take rate. This trend is likely to remain in the near term.Finally, near-term spending on customer acquisition and restructuring of the international operations will be necessary for GRPN to get on the path to recovery. This quarter clearly showed that customer growth on a q/q basis has stalled so investors can expect additional marketing spend to weigh in on profit. Despite all these negative headlines, I continue to like GRPN and at the current valuation it does not appear that M&A premium is baked in."
3656496,89226,2015-11-06T09:32:16-05:00,"The stock finished Wednesday’s trading session down sharply after a poor Q3 earnings report set in.The decline for Groupon’s stock is only going to get worse unless significant changes are made, but this doesn't come without higher marketing and integration costs.The holiday earnings season is going to create an interesting confluence of expectations, for which Groupon controls its own fate.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a stock that I particularly enjoy shorting because it's affordable to do so, has a little to no value-add component, and management troubles. When you see a Q3 report like Groupon's on Tuesday, you understand that guidance is everything. How do you fix a company like Groupon? For a start, the firm needs to beat on Q4 revenue, given it is the most lucrative time of year, continue to make partnerships in the food delivery space, and put the large cash assets to use.Performance UpdateOn top of a double-digit YTD decline, Tuesday's 26.30% decline hurts, undoubtedly. The stock is now trading sub-$3 and while that may change as this week closes out, as a result of a near overselling according to the RSI being at 33.43, dropping from nearly 60, the fact remains that Groupon is trading in dangerously low territory. The 50 and 200 DMAs are out of reach for Q4, unless a major positive development occurs. Below you can see the three month view of this company:Source: StockChartsSo, What Happened?Interestingly enough, earnings weren't all that bad. The company posted revenue down just under $25 million, which while significantly lower than Q1 at $750.4 million, still highlighted the strength of North American operations. Revenue in this segment was up some $45 million YOY. Unfortunately, the segment posted an operating loss thanks to a $37.5 million expense for contingent liability.The company was going into earnings with high expectations. Management needed to show that the cost savings from cutting nearly 1,000 employees was going to lead to a far stronger bottom line than what was reported. Even with the strong YTD downtrend and current low level, shareholders were hoping that Groupon would affirm a strong Q4, as they've experienced in past years due to the holiday season pickup, but this was not the case. The net income margin is currently -3.87%.Until we can see their marketing expenses pay off in a meaningful way, this company is going to have a tough time bolstering all geographic segments, particularly EMEA. This one, in particular, was down 13.4% YOY.Outlook Lacks The Value-AddI've said it before that despite the low price of the company, there is room to short based upon the lack of a value-add component. Why do I need Groupon? That's the real question you should be asking yourself if you're a shareholder. Below is the change in short interest YTD. What we can see here is that over the course of the year, it actually declined, meaning maybe shareholders felt a surge of confidence rolling into the holiday season. Now the two week update for Nov. 1 is yet to be reported and it would be my guess that the short interest would increase considerably after the earnings report we just had.Source: NasdaqContinuing our discussion of Q4 outlook brings us to the holiday season, where Groupon, not surprisingly, has had its greatest results. In 2014 Q4, the company posted revenue of $925.4 million, before retreating back to its $750 million mark in Q1. This was the only quarter out of the last four that was positive in terms of net income, but this bottom line was still bleak at just $8.79 million. Reducing the outlook by saying the top line will fall by some $50-100 million created too much negative sentiment. The problem lies in that the company cannot keep profitability up, which weighs heavily on their ability to expand.Furthermore, what was notable about Groupon in Q3 was that OCF turned negative. Q3 2014 showed OCF of $39.43 million and has since retreated to -$31.37 million. This is the first quarter in the last year to have a negative OCF and is not a good indicator of growth within the company, despite high marketing expenses. Why the cash assets of $963.6 million are not being put to better use fools me.ConclusionGroupon has little to work with and, in my opinion, is a weak public company. I believe the removal of Lefkofsky is a good start to changing the direction of the company, but a lot now rests on new CEO Rich Williams. Interestingly enough, the company has set low expectations for itself for Q4 and if the next earnings report shows that they surpassed the guidance given on Tuesday and trends towards last year's numbers, then this stock will go higher. Since I don't believe that is realistic, I am going to continue to short."
3568676,89226,2015-10-13T12:21:07-04:00,"Significant employee cuts are necessary to keeping this company financially stable and prevent further declines.The company heavily correlates with Zynga, who's actually doing much better on a short-term basis.The bulls point to $1 billion in cash and the holiday season as future catalysts, but I don't see them having notable YOY improvements.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a company with a serious problem: It's not strong enough to see upside in its equity, yet it is running out of room for investors to short. Trading at just $3.76 a share, this company is being brought down by restructuring, a weak business model, and incompetence from management. It is still a strong sell in my opinion because of these flaws.Employee CutsReducing the amount of employees directly impacts SG&A, which for Groupon, can certainly help them in the future if they reinvest the money wisely, but it sends a signal to shareholders that this company is having trouble managing expenses as well as aligning interests. I found arguably the best picture of Groupon's employees:This round of cuts was large at 1,100 employees and a $35 million impairment for providing severance packages and exit costs. I'd fully expect Groupon to make further cuts in the coming months and incur more related charges.Allow me to remind you of 2010 when this company turned down $6 billion from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) for a buyout. With a market cap today of just $2.5 billion, management stood to gain hundreds of millions each, the company would have been integrated well with Google, and may have been a decent ancillary revenue stream for the company. Now, they have troubles on their hands, all because they believed in the long-term value of internet coupons.Revenue and Net IncomeTheir top and bottom line tell a sad story, indeed. In terms of how they fare versus other companies in the larger market, they have relatively good financial health. Having $1.12 billion in cash is an exceptional asset. Unfortunately, what we are seeing with this company is deterioration and it is soon to be accelerated based upon their failing business model.YOY, quarterly revenue is down 1.7% and from Q1 to Q2, revenue was down 1.59%. Now, this isn't terrible, but let's look at the bigger picture. Their revenue has actually grown over the last few years from $1.61 billion in 2011 to $3.19 billion in 2014. That's a near 50% increase in revenue, but is that sustainable? Arguably not given the trouble they're having on the shorter time frame. I'd expect them to post $3.4 billion in revenue for 2015 as 2014, based upon the slowing revenue growth.Think about a related company, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). They have a heavy correlation to Groupon since they have been public, yet last quarter, they showed a 30% increase in revenue YOY. Compare that to the 1.59% decline for Groupon in the same time frame. See the trend below of the two companies versus the Nasdaq:Source: Yahoo! FinanceThat decline is dismal and whether or not this company continues to decline further into OTC territory, becomes an acquisition target, or goes bankrupt, is up to the markets themselves, but the point is that even with Zynga up 30% YOY in revenue, we have similar charts. So, even if Groupon was to post as significant revenue growth, is it enough to pull it out of the long-term slump? I'd argue that we'd see some short-term gains because Groupon shareholders are desperate for positivity, but a further decline would ultimately set in.Value-Add: Where Are You?The problem with this company is that it was once revolutionary. Despite having the e and m-commerce advantage, they are the epitome of what can happen when the model fails to adapt.What real value-added component does Groupon have left? I've seen individuals talk about their restaurant platform, saying it rivals GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), but that's a space that has significant barriers to entry given customer loyalty and who's playing in the space. Google, Yelp (NYSE:YELP), GrubHub, and even Uber, have significant restaurant platforms and soon, this space will become too fragmented for Groupon to have a shot at gaining a useful amount of market share.So, How Do We Play This Stock?If you're sitting on the sidelines right now, you're probably wondering whether or not you should make an entry. I'll continue to short Groupon until the mid-$2 range, unless significant catalysts develop, and at that point I will reevaluate my argument. I'd honestly expect to see a takeover offer more than anything in the coming months."

Heading into the results, I remain bullish on GRPN's long-term prospects as the dominant O2O leader in North America. Looking at the precedent set in Asia with Meituan-Dianping, GRPN's proven track record in the local deals space positions the company well for the pending O2O trend in the region. Additionally, GRPN could also attract strategic investments from larger internet companies as they integrate payment and local deals into their overall product offering. Finally, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent pullback in daily deals highlights the challenges of the overall industry, but also suggests that a declining number of competitors can only favor the company with the proven business model and scale. In this case, GRPN certainly checks all the right boxes and I am bullish ahead of the results.Consensus expects $0.02 in EPS and $734m in revenue. Note that GRPN recently announced a workforce restructuring and plans to book a $22-24m in pre-tax charge this upcoming quarter. Although it may not be the most pleasant thing for the company, I believe that it is a necessary step for GRPN to improve efficiency and long-term profitability. Worth noting that the headcount reduction will focus mostly on critical sales, sales support and back-end operation roles, which may not have a direct impact on revenue generation, and will eventually have to be let go due to the ongoing efficiency initiatives.Also worth highlighting that the recent exit from Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay is a long-term positive given that those markets deliver less attractive ROI to the group. So all the changes made by GRPN could eventually pay dividends in the long-run.As for the existing local deals market, near-term competitive intensity from AMZN, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have yet to negatively impact GRPN in a way that many analysts have expected. Although some analysts continue to remain cautious on this potential long-term negative catalyst, I counter that those companies' core business are not centered around local deals and that their local deals offerings are much smaller than that of GRPN. As such, the best way for these large players to enter the local deals market is to acquire companies such as GRPN or Meituan-Dianping to drive cross-product integration and ecosystem expansion. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has executed in this area and I would not be surprised to see GOOG or FB follow a similar path. (see - Alibaba And Tencent: Creating The O2O Powerhouse)"
3582606,22445,2015-10-19T13:13:40-04:00,"The market has proved me wrong about Groupon in the past.However, I still don't understand why so many analysts are so bearish.I rate the stock a buy, based on its current valuation, and also because of the possibilities the company's food delivery service offers.","I have been trying to figure out the love-hate relationship between Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and the market for a long time, but I still don't get it.Yes, I mean the fact that growth is at a standstill for several quarters now is an issue. Also the fact that several of GRPN's global ventures did not play out as intended. However, is this a reason to mark down the stock so much? I think not, and this is where the opportunity lies.A stop-loss means you made a mistake, not the end of the worldWhen you buy a stock and it does not work out, you sell. That's called a stop-loss, folks. When you enter a market or business and it does not work out for you, then it's better to exit at a loss than to continue. If you make a profit on it at the same time (like GRPN did), all the better.Everyone is complaining about the fact that Groupon exited Ticket Monster. I am not management to know exactly what happened, but if they decided to sell for whatever reason, then it's probably a good enough reason. As for reducing the headcount 1,100 jobs, sure, it's not a good sign, but it's better than not doing it if you need to do it.Groupon also exited Turkey and Greece and divested out of India. In my mind at least, they know when to leave before losses mount even higher. And that is a sign of vigilant management.So while everyone is saying that Groupon's business model has not worked in many places around the world, I am satisfied that they know when to stop and move to something else.Now let's look at the company's numbers. GRPN's most recent quarter was not that bad.Gross billings, increased to $1.53 billion in Q2, compared to $1.50 billion in Q2 of 2014. Gross billings grew 2% globally, but would have grown by 10% if it were not for the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. On an F/X neutral basis, North America billings increased 12%, EMEA increased 9% and Rest of World increased 6%.Gross profit was $337 million in Q2 of 2015, compared with $366.4 million in the second quarter 2014. But again, if it were not for the $28.3 million in unfavorable year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, gross profit would have been $365.3 million.Net EPS was $0.16 per share, even if it was related to a one-time gain from the sale of Ticket Monster. But please remember, the company is in restructuring mode. This is what happens when you restructure, you have a lot of restructuring expenses that reduce your profits.However, if we look at forward guidance, the company expects revenue to be between $700-$750 (included is the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates), EBITDA between $45-$60 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00-$0.02 per share for Q3 of 2015. So in other words, the worst is behind them as far as the restructuring process.Next, let's look at valuation. Folks, GRPN is currently valued at about 0.7 2016 revenue. On top of that, the company has $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents on hand. I am sorry, but this is one of the cheapest companies in its category (if not the cheapest) that I know of.And it makes you wonder, what was everyone smoking when they were paying an arm and a leg for GRPN at the IPO? Seriously, folks, some of you were buying hand over fist at the IPO and are spitting on this stock today?Finally, I am actually very bullish on Groupon's new food delivery business, Groupon To Go. Yes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) along with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are also getting into this business, however, where is it written that just because Amazon will get into this business that it will be successful?Please remember Groupon already has relationships with thousands of restaurants all around the U.S., and in my mind, building on these relationships for a delivery service is the next logical step.Sure, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) already has a head start, but please also note that the food delivery service business is at least a $70 billion sector, according to several sources. GrubHub, which is probably the leader in the space, only did $88 million in revenue last quarter. What I am trying to say is that even if many players enter the space, there is room for everyone for now.Something else that's important is the fact that while cash and equivalents have been increasing over the past several quarters, the company was able to retire about 5% of its common stock. Yes, that is not a whole lot, but it's better than nothing and it's better than increasing the float.Bottom lineI know I have been proven wrong about GRPN in the past. However, in this game, the trick is to sell when you think it's not playing out, and to buy again when you think everyone else is missing something. At these levels, I think everyone is missing that GRPN is a bargain at these prices.Personally, I think the deals and coupon business is not going anywhere and it's going to be with us permanently. In addition, I am very bullish on the company entering the food delivery business. In fact, I think the prospects of food delivery are enough reasons to be bullish on the stock, let alone everything else I mentioned.Time will tell if I am proven wrong once again; however, a bargain is a bargain and investors should not shy away from stocks like GRPN, because they have stumbled in the past."
3614266,39791,2015-10-28T12:59:00-04:00,Weak business model and inept management.The business is still limping along despite the IPO happening way back in 2011.Q2 revenues fell q/q and full-year EBITDA guidance was lowered.Increasing competition is creating pressure on margins.,"I had recommended selling Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock a couple of years back when it was trading at the $5 level. Today the stock trades at ~$3.5 and the investment case has become even weaker. Groupon has failed to deliver profits since its much hyped IPO in 2011. Groupon serves more than 500 markets globally with 48 million customers, featuring more than 425,000 active deals. Though management has tried to turn around the company with disposal of a non-performing division, I would still advise investors to remain on the sidelines given the huge threat it faces from bigger technological companies and its poor management performance.Why is the stock not a buy1) Profits are not growing - Though Groupon was successful in reporting increasing revenues, it failed to convert these revenues into profits. In other words there was no bottom line growth. The expenses have matched the growth in revenues. Though revenue growth is important, generating profits is even more crucial for a business. No profits and that too for a long time is a bad sign for investors.Data from Morningstar2) Lack of a differentiated business model - Groupon suffers from lack of a differentiated business model. After its discounting business failed to grow, Groupon was forced to enter the e-commerce space competing with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The company does not have the scale or technological capabilities to become a successfully large e-commerce company. It does not operate in a niche nor does it have the logistical and brand name of an Amazon.3) Businesses globally improving but not booming - North America remains a strong market for Groupon. With a focus to further strengthen its North American focus, the company acquired OrderUp. Groupon has weak presence in China most of which can be attributed to the fact that the Chinese always prefer local companies. Its EMEA segment operating income amounted to $10 million which had declined by 50% since Q1 2015. Rest of the World segment witnessed higher billings, but there was a decline in revenues. The company is exiting fast growing markets like Korea and India. After the sale of Korea's Ticket Monster in May, there was a partial sale of its India business to Sequoia.4) Low barrier to entry - Since the entry barrier to the Internet discounting model is low, anyone can enter into the same line of business as Groupon. Anyone having minimal technological capabilities can build a software similar to Groupon and resort to email marketing. With competition heating up, Groupon has to spend a lot on acquiring both customers and start-up businesses. Other than small regional competition, Groupon also faces pressures from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.5) Inept management behind its current woes - I believe Groupon's management is weak based on their actions from IPO to the present. The company's actions have been criticized by the analyst world. It paid more than $900 million to its founders from its venture capital funding when it could be used for business. Management had used Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income to inflate and present its operating losses as profits in its IPO application. The company also was involved in some accounting and internal control issues. Management also declined Google's offer to buy Groupon, which the company's investors would be regretting given the company is trading much below the offer price.6) Q2 Performance was poor with EBITDA guidance lowered - Q2 2015 revenue and billings fell below Q1 2015 as can be seen from the metrics below. However the company posted an earnings per share of $0.16 compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in Q1 2015.The company maintained its full-year revenue guidance between $3.15-3.30 billion, however the adjusted EBITDA guidance was lowered from $315 million to $290 million.Upside Risksa) Streamlining operations - The company is thinking of streamlining its operations by eliminating 1,100 people globally over the next year. Groupon will wind down operations in Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand, Greece, Turkey and Uruguay. This will help Groupon concentrate its focus on profitable countries. It also will be integrating local, getaways and goods segments into one division - shopping and services.b) Potential acquisition target - Groupon has a market capitalization value of ~$2.3 billion, with $1 billion as cash assets and no significant debt. The company has a good online presence and a decent brand name. Unless Groupon management messes up again, it looks like an attractive buyout candidate.Stock Performance and ValuationGRPN stock is currently trading at ~$3, which is more than 50% lower than it 52-week high price of $8.43 and almost 90% lower than its all-time high price of $26. The stock has lost 86% of its value since its IPO. The market capitalization also declined to ~$2.3 billion. The stock has a P/S of 0.7x and P/B of 3x with a forward P/E of ~23x. Though the valuation may not look expensive, it's justified given the company performance so far.ConclusionGroupon is trying to turn around its business by disposing unprofitable units and venturing into new products. However profitability remains a concern given management lowered its EBITDA guidance. It will be interesting to see if the company delivers the promised double-digit growth in Q3 2015. The company has been trying to restructure operations for a long time, however investors seem to have run out of patience. Groupon also faces growing competition from start-ups as well as well-established technological giants like Google and Amazon. Despite the low valuation and price decline, I'm not sure about buying the stock and would advise investors to remain on the sidelines."
3528736,69675,2015-09-23T11:07:42-04:00,"Groupon edged lower after management announced it would cut about 10% of its work force and cease operations in some areas overseas.For investors, this is another blow that signals Groupon's days of high-flying growth are over.With its restructuring activities, however, the company looks set to turn itself into a slow-growing cash cow that should offer some appeal to long-term investors moving forward.While there's always risk involved, this makes the business an interesting prospect in my opinion, but I do worry about excessive executive compensation.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) fell slightly on Tuesday after news broke that management has elected to cut 1,100 of the company's jobs, comprising around 10% of its global workforce. In conjunction with that, the company stated that it would be closing certain locations in an effort to reorganize its operations and to place a greater emphasis, instead, on improving its core areas of operations. While it's clear that Mr. Market isn't responding very nicely to this move, my own belief is that this step has the potential to turn Groupon from a net loss-generating growth story to a slow-growth cash cow.A look at Groupon's operationsFrom a revenue perspective, the situation at Groupon has been really impressive in recent years. Between 2010 and 2014, the company's top line grew from $312.94 million to $3.19 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing publicly traded companies ever. Unfortunately, though, things began to change this year. In the first two quarters of its 2015 fiscal year, the business's revenue inched up a modest 3.1% from $1.44 billion to $1.49 billion. The main problem here has been that the company's Third Party and Other category of revenue fell by 9% but, thankfully, this was more than offset by a 16.8% jump in the company's Direct category.While Groupon's revenue growth has been impressive, its bottom line has been a continuous disappointment but has, fortunately, been improving. Over the same timeframe, the business reported a net loss every single year but this did narrow significantly, falling from a loss of $456.32 million to a loss of $73.09 million. Year-to-date, we've seen even greater improvement for the company and, at last, a major milestone. In the first two quarters of its 2015 fiscal year, Groupon saw its net income grow from a loss of $60.67 million to a gain of $94.81 million.Although Groupon's bottom line has been dismal, its cash flows have been fairly consistent over the past four years, coming in at $288.82 million in 2014. This year, however, is already looking to be better than in the past. So far, management has reported cash from operating activities during the company's first two quarters of $50.71 million, far better than the -$43.10 million the company saw the same period a year earlier, driven largely by a more appealing bottom line and a greater add-back associated with its stock-based compensation. Keeping all else the same for the next two quarters, Groupon's operating cash flow would add up to $382.63 million by year-end. Given the company's current market cap, shares would be priced at 6.80 times cash flow if this turns out to be the case.A much-needed restructuringThere's no doubt that sales have, more or less, hit a peak. This has left many tech-oriented investors unhappy with the once high-flying niche play because, to many of them, sales growth is the single most important financial metric for a business. The train of thought is that, if a company can grow and become a massive player in its space, it's difficult, if not impossible, for competition to displace it; profits can come after achieving its intended market share. While this method of investing does not resonate with me, I can understand why some investors behave this way.Unfortunately for them, though, the days of fast growth for Groupon appear to be over and management appears to be undergoing a paradigm shift where it's focusing on profits as opposed to grabbing market share. This has been made very clear in its recent press release, which stated that, in addition to letting go of around 10% of its workforce, the company will be exiting certain countries. On top of Greece and Turkey, which the company had already decided to stop operating in, it intends to cease its operations in Morocco, The Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand, and Uruguay.This approach seems to be counterintuitive to its past strategy of growing as quickly as possible, even at the cost of profits, but that's because it is. As we've already seen year-to-date, Groupon is trying (and very successfully achieving) cost-cutting initiatives aimed at bolstering its bottom line. Management has not made known how much the business will save by cutting these workers but, if you assume the average employee makes just $30,000 (it's likely higher but I'm trying to be conservative), this will save Groupon $33 million per year on a pre-tax basis.Yes, the downside is that the company's sales growth will slow further or, possibly, even shrink, but, at the end of the day, the single most important measure of a company's value is the present value of its future cash flows. By making these changes, combined with all the other changes already made, Groupon could very well become a true cash cow.Where Groupon should be focusing onOne thing that I've harped on in the past that could aid Groupon in its quest toward higher profits is to focus more on growing its Groupon Getaways operations. In the first two quarters of this year, the company's revenue for its Travel segment came out to just $82.62 million making it, by far, the smallest segment the company has. In addition to being in a big business, the company's gross profit margin in this space is nearly as impressive as rival Priceline (PCLN), which reported a gross profit margin year-to-date of 91.4% compared to Groupon's 82.8%. It seems, however, that the company doesn't care much about this part of the company, as evidenced by the fact that sales associated with it are up just 5.6% compared to where they were this time last year.The gross profit margin for Travel aren't as impressive as the 87.8% margin reported by Groupon's Local segment but this is the one area where the company's top line growth has been going in reverse. Meanwhile, the fastest-growing aspect of the business has been its Goods segment, which grew 12.5% year-over-year, but this part of the company generates a paltry 13.8% gross profit margin which means that, as this segment continues to grow, it could offset some of the business's cost-cutting initiatives. If management is truly serious about improving profits instead of placing a strong emphasis on growth, Travel is the area where they should be looking very closely at.TakeawayI really do like the Groupon business model but things are changing rapidly. After the initial interest grew in the company's Local segment, business started falling off and the company is trying to make up for that with its Goods segment and its Travel segment. Goods will almost certainly grow over the long run as e-commerce soars, but the small profit margins it reports are nothing to brag about compared to its Travel segment and its declining Local segment.In spite of these issues, however, I am intrigued with Groupon at current levels. The business has $1.11 billion in cash (nearly 43% of its market cap) and no debt. Add to this the fact that cash flows and profits are finally starting to improve and I wouldn't be surprised to see Groupon's growth become immaterial and for the business to transform from a high-growth profitless company to a slow-growth cash cow.Perhaps the only thing that makes me hesitant about buying shares right now is the fact that I'm not comfortable with management taking $73.63 million in stock-based compensation in the first two quarters this year while they are letting employees go. In my opinion, a good company should see executives take some haircut before firing rank-and-file employees. I understand that stock-based compensation has no cash impact on the business but I believe the business would be better off using those shares for internal investments and/or as a partial substitute to employees' wages (lower wages and give shares or options so that fewer are let go)."
3524966,72045,2015-09-22T15:30:34-04:00,"Groupon is a textbook example of how to scare shareholders away.Management seems incapable of turning this ship around.At 1 billion in cash, it's simply a waiting game before the shorts will take over.","If one firm got beaten the last few years, it is Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), an e-commerce marketplace connecting millions of customers who seek discounts with local merchants providing a variety of goods and services.I think the costumers of Groupon are quite satisfied, yet Groupon's investors are not as the share price has been very disappointing year to date:As the line chart above depicts, Groupon's share price slumped massively since the beginning of this year and revenue stalled to 6.77% (orange line).Groupon's MissionSource: GrouponThis article will cover a fundamental analysis of Groupon.Groupon announced earningsGroupon recently announced earnings and it's worth having a look at what they have to present:Source: GrouponAs the column above clearly depicts, revenue growth seems to stall. For a company which depends on getting more customers and local merchants together, stalling revenue brings up an important red flag. I would expect higher revenue numbers for an e-commerce juggernaut, especially as the firm has been in business for quite some years now.These numbers could indicate the possibility that the firm is already surpassing its essential growth phase and entering into a more mature phase from a business perspective:This would be a scenario where growth is mostly achieved by inorganic growth, such as mergers and acquisitions.Source: GrouponEven though growth is stalling in some segments, growth is still on the table when it comes to other parts of the firm such as Active Deals and Units.Yet one of the more important metrics, spent per active customer decreased in comparison to a year ago. If the firm can bring in more customers, but not the cash to go with it, problems occur.Groupon is aware of these issues as they laid them out in their investor presentation with a strategy to tackle these issues:Source: GrouponThe process depicted above: continue their way forward with more supply, get it to the customer/merchant more quickly and start mass marketing to accelerate the cycle is in my view is not a groundbreaking strategy and no different than what the firm has been trying to achieve for years.The problem is not only stalling revenue, but also declining expenditure per active client. Groupon tries to counter this by speeding up delivery in order to reduce costs and increase margins:Source: GrouponYet when you look at the actual profit margin it has been rather flat for years:Which creates the idea that increasing margins by speeding up delivery and refine pricing might not be very effective as that is what Groupon has tried to do for years. Therefore, I believe Groupon will not be able to achieve much higher margins in comparison to what they have right now.Earning ExpectationsEarnings expectations are dismal for a company which employs over 10,000 employees:Source: Yahoo FinanceIn a DCF model with an EPS of $0.14 (avg. estimate for Dec-15) with 10% growth for 5 years thereafter declining to 5% terminal growth: the fair value would lie somewhere around $3. I consider 20% annual EPS growth for Groupon unreasonable and unrealistic considering the nature of its business and how it performed the last few years.Groupon: my list of issuesCompetitorsGroupon as business is not doing anything unique which makes it very easy to compete with. There are many competitors such as: LivingSocial, OneDayOnly, SweetDeal and many more. As the firm has nothing unique to offer, it's difficult to maintain market share.And when it does increase market-share, it's easier for competitors to snoop market share away from Groupon which leaves Groupon no choice but to do aggressive expansion through mergers and acquisitions. Considering the current management team in place, I don't have much faith in a good ending. I fear overpaid acquisitions, which might end up in large impairment charges and even though Groupon has an abundant pile of cash. It can be swept away easily by only a few mistakes.ManagementManagement has been a thorn in the eye of many shareholders for years. For example: management has sold many of their own positions in the stock over the last 12 months putting significant downward pressure on the stock:Source: NasdaqIt's not difficult to interpret this as having not much faith in your own company. Going over the majority of the presentations during the last quarters, the issues remain the same with a familiar way of trying to tackle the issues (by being more cost-efficient, increase margin etc.). In my view, management lacks a clear vision to tackle the real issues of Groupon.Business ModelIts business model of bringing customers and (small) merchants together is very simple. Yet, for this business model the firm employs over 10,000 employees. For example Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Linkedin (LNKD) has less employees. Now they might not run the same particular business, something tells me that 10,000 employees for a barely profitable organization is a little bit over enthusiastic.Groupon: ShareholdersSource: MorningstarCarmignac and Fidelity are major shareholders of Groupon. It is interesting to notice that Carmignac has not been performing as it has done in the past. The investment fund is performing quite poor for around a year now:Source: BloombergI would not be surprised that at some point, Carmignac will diminish their position in Groupon and, for example, add more shares to their position in Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), one of my all-time favorite investments.This as I do consider Carmignac a solid investment fund with an excellent management team which brought back better than average returns the last few years.Groupon - My Own ExperienceNot too long ago, I've actually used a Groupon voucher for swimming an entire day in Terma Bialka, a Polish swimming pool while I was on holiday. The massive discount was definitely worth it, yet in Poland for example, there are plenty of other competitors which also give proper discounts to get into the same swimming pool.This was duly notable when entering the swimming facilities as the goal of the client (all the families with children) was the discount, not whether they got it from Groupon or a competitor, neither made it a difference for the swimming pool itself. There are plenty of other copy cats in Poland with similar activities not doing anything substantially different from Groupon, such as Grupeo.It sums up the core issues for me when it comes to Groupon and its future potential. Groupon is not offering a better discount nor better service than any of the competitors I've seen in Europe.Groupon is mostly US-basedSource: AlexaThe fact hat Groupon has a strong position in America is a benefit as it gives Groupon space to grow in other countries. Especially, due to its large portion of cash, it has the ability to acquire competitors over the border wherever it would like. In my view, this is the only single large green flag when it comes to the future of Groupon. Cash and the ability to acquire (small)-time competitors in different countries.Analyst RecommendationsSource: 4tradersIt's interesting from an analytical perspective that out of 21 analysts, no one holds a current sell order. The massive amount of holds is considerably remarkable, as it indicates people are not willing to go full short (or long) on Groupon as it's still sitting on a cash pile of 1 billion dollars. Advising either a significant long or short position is definitely risky.ConclusionIn my view, there are a variety of things wrong with Groupon:Its business model is expensive, management showed no charisma over the last few years letting Groupon slip away from its throne. Moreover, the ideas to enhance its margins were no different than any other year ago and I don't see any reason why these margins would significantly increase in the future. Groupon will be able to enhance its margins with some cost cutting and making its business more efficient (partnering up with larger clients), but these are dismal improvements and I believe this will not pull Groupon out of its current issues.Groupon needs a more shareholder friendly management and a solid strategic plan to acquire great Groupon look a likes. Unfortunately, as I don't believe management will do anything at all, I foresee a grim future for this once interesting startup company. Shorting a firm wit a billion cash in hand is a little risky, but the firm eventually has to delve in its large pile of cash in order to get the engine rolling again. If revenue remains stagnant during those periods and the margins only increased a few percent, Groupon is effectively over and out, and by that time worth of a short towards bankruptcy."
3560126,37771,2015-10-08T14:29:31-04:00,"While Groupon has been able to successfully grow revenue, net income and margins remain essentially breakeven.Groupon plans to expand its Groupon Goods and Groupon To Go food delivery services, but these are already lower margin, highly competitive spaces.The company is in the midst of a corporate restructure that will result in 1,100 jobs eliminated and a $35M charge associated with it.","Online deal maker Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has had a rough go of it almost since it IPO'ed in 2011. Since its peak that year the stock has dropped 86% including a 55% decline in 2015 alone. What started out as a promising growth business has turned into a question of simply whether or not it will survive.The daily deal business model was rapidly gaining popularity when the company went public, but four years later the sector has lost its momentum and is no longer considered a rapid growth area. With investors having taken such a beating, it's worth asking if the stock is one that should be avoided altogether or if there's still a chance for buy-low investors to make some money.Groupon I think is one of the few instances where you could make a compelling case for either side. I fall more on the bear side of the argument but for those more optimistic about Groupon there is a case that could be made for buying at these levels. The primary reason would be that for a company that's seen such a drop in its stock price the balance sheet doesn't look like it's in all that bad shape.Overall, revenue hasn't been a problem for Groupon. Since debuting publicly in 2011, the company has grown revenue from less than $0.5B to a projected $3.2B in 2015. Additionally, expectations are for revenue growth of another 11% in 2016. The composition of that revenue, however, has changed over time, but I'll get to that in a little bit. The company has no long-term debt to speak of on its balance sheet, has consistently maintained at least $1B in cash on hand and has regularly generated somewhere between $100M and $200M in annual free cash flow.From a pure financial point of view it appears that the company is in no imminent danger of disappearing, but the overall state of the business is concerning. Despite the relatively healthy balance sheet, here are four reasons I'm staying away from Groupon.The composition of revenue is changingOne of my biggest concerns is what exactly is driving revenue. Groupon used to be a business driven by its daily deals. Margins for those deals were high, but that part of the business hasn't been demonstrating any real growth for some time now. Groupon added its ""Goods"" line of business in order to add another revenue stream. While that part of the business is showing some potential, its margins are much lower, making it that much more difficult to drive income to the bottom line.My bigger worry with the Goods division is that sooner or later it's going to run into the buzzsaw known as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon has been known to aggressively go after competitors it feels can get in its way (Amazon's decision to drop Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast from its web store and the decision to launch Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) competitor ""Homemade"" are just two examples). Groupon isn't a real big competitor to Amazon but competing with the online giant in discounted retail goods generally doesn't end well. What you end up with is a two-part business - one with flatlining revenue and one that will likely end up getting crushed by Amazon.The business model is flawedFormer CEO Andrew Mason said so himself earlier this year. He's been known to make bombastic comments, but for this one I don't think he's off base.At its core, Groupon is a glorified coupon cutting business. It offers discounts on a limited range of items and there is nothing really proprietary about the business. There are a number of other similar business models out there right now (including the aforementioned Amazon) and the buzz that once surrounded the deep discount deal now seems to have largely faded away.Unless Groupon can find some way to reinvent itself beyond what it currently is it's difficult to see the company surviving over the long term.Low margins and difficulty generating profitDespite revenue that continues to grow, Groupon just hasn't been able to generate any type of margin or profit to go along with it. Quarterly earnings have generally floated around the breakeven mark for much of the last three years. Operating and profit margins are in roughly the same boat.Last quarter was encouraging with the company posting a $0.16/share profit although $0.21/share of that came from the sale of Ticket Monster. With the low margin business growing and the high margin business stagnating this is situation that Groupon could be in for a while.Restructuring may not be the answerGroupon's corporate restructuring news has been well known for a while. The company is eliminating around 1,100 jobs and is shedding unprofitable assets (particularly overseas) to get things moving forward. There will be a roughly $35M charge linked to the transaction to cover things like employee benefits and severance packages as well.The problem here is that the company likely won't see any type of savings until next year and even then it's not clear what type of return Groupon will see on these savings which it says will be reinvested back into the business. Groupon plans on launching a food delivery service next but while that segment of the market is growing it's also very crowded with businesses like Peapod, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and (not to sound like a broken record but …) Amazon already competing.ConclusionIt feels like Groupon is one of those dot-com internet fads that's doomed to slowly die out. The revenue growth story is encouraging; however, if the company is having difficulty generating a profit on that revenue growth and its chosen new growth markets are areas that are already heavily competitive, I'm just not feeling a sense of optimism for Groupon's future.I believe that Groupon is a company that may stick around for a while longer but won't have a significant presence in the marketplace going forward."
3654046,95376,2015-11-05T18:09:33-05:00,"We initiate the coverage of Groupon with a Buy rating and target price of $3.4 per share.Despite rising concerns about Groupon's future outlook, we believe that the market and analysts have over-reacted to management's recent announcements related to weak guidance and aggressive marketing investments.Key assumptions underlying our estimation of target price for Groupon include fall in EBITDA margins during 2016 but recovery in 2017; and recovery in revenue growth from 2017 onwards.","Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) has dropped roughly 28% in value after providing a weak outlook for the fourth quarter (4Q) of its fiscal year 2015 (FY15). According to the recent announcements, the company expects its revenues for 4QFY15 to be in the range of $815 million to $865 million, which falls below the analysts' estimate of $950 million for the same period. Furthermore, Groupon guided its adjusted EBITDA for 4QFY15 to be between $40 million and $60 million, translating into almost no earnings on adjusted basis. This also falls significantly below the analysts' earnings estimate of $0.07 per share for the quarter. The primary reasons for weak outlook include pressure from changes in foreign exchange rates and increased marketing investments for customer acquisition.While we remain concerned about Groupon's future outlook and do not expect any significant improvement in the fundamentals for the next twelve months, the long-term prospects look strong, suggesting that the market has over-reacted to the announcements made by management. We find Groupon's current valuations to provide a good opportunity for going long the stock. Therefore, we initiate coverage of the company with a Buy rating and target price of $3.4 per share, suggesting over 17% upside potential.The key assumptions underlying our target price include an improvement in the valuation multiple to past six-month average; recovery in revenues from 2017 onwards after a fall during 2015 and 2016; reduction in magnitude of foreign exchange pressures on topline; stabilization of gross margins after little contraction in 2016; and recovery in EBITDA margins from 2017 onwards after a fall in 2016. These assumptions are discussed in detail below, along with the rationale for these assumptions.Investors shouldn't worry about slowdown in toplineAlthough Groupon's revenue growth is seen to be slowing down, owing to forex pressures and recent changes in the management's plans, we believe that this shouldn't worry investors because the stock looks undervalued even after incorporating these changes. Furthermore, the changes are temporary and revenue growth will regain strength due to easing of forex pressures, benefits of marketing investments, and benefits of focus on higher quality merchants.Groupon has continued to see significant pressure on its top-line due to forex changes this year. The unfavorable changes in forex rates affected the company's top-line by average 733 basis points (bps) over the past three quarters. This currency impact is also significantly higher compared to 100 bps for the fiscal year 2014, thus pulling down investors' sentiments.However, we believe that these forex pressures are temporary and their magnitude will decline going forward. This is because the foreign currencies will eventually gain strength with recovery in emerging and developing markets. This is also evident from the company's guidance of a lower 400 bps for unfavorable impact of changes in forex rates on Groupon's topline growth during 4QFY15. Forex pressures have been one of the key factors responsible for weakness in revenue growth, and as these pressures ease out revenues will gain strength. Based on these expectations, our forecasts assume that forex pressures will negatively affect revenue growth by a significant 700 bps in 2015, but a lower 400 bps in 2016, reducing further to no impact in 2017.Source: Company data, PVR estimatesThe company also plans to reduce its focus on lower-margin products such as consumer electronics, that is expected to negatively impact its revenues. However, this again should not be a sign of worry as it will help Groupon improve long-term profitability and competitiveness, thus leading to an expansion in the company's valuations.It should also be noted that Groupon has significantly increased its planned marketing investments and raised its ROI threshold from roughly six months to the range of about 12 months to 18 months. This reflects a shift in the company's strategy to long-term growth compared to short-term growth. Therefore, the revenue growth will show strength when current marketing investments start producing results after 12 to 18 months.Apart from that, Groupon has also increased its focus on attracting higher quality merchants. While this strategy might affect the company's commission rates in the short term, it will support long-term demand creation, thus benefiting the company. Furthermore, Groupon's increased focus on mobile offerings is expected to improve consumer engagement in the long run, thus supporting growth further.Based on the results of first three quarters and guidance for fourth quarter, we forecast Groupon's revenues to grow 2.3% on currency neutral basis in 2015, followed by improvement in 2016 and 2017 owing to the reasons discussed above. Our forecasts for Groupon's revenue growth on currency neutral basis are provided in the graph below.Source: Company data, PVR estimatesGroupon's profitability will recover in 2017The expected deterioration of profitability remains to be another big concern for Groupon's investors, as the recently announced strategy of increasing marketing investments for customer acquisition is expected to significantly affect the company's profitability in 2016. However, we believe that reduction in profitability during 2016 will strengthen the company's long-term growth prospects and profitability will start to recover in 2017 and onwards.According to recent announcements, Groupon's management plans to invest about $150 million to $200 million in marketing activities for supporting growth in customer acquisition, primarily in the high growth region of North America. Such an aggressive marketing strategy has the potential to result in almost 50% decline in Groupon's EITDA margins for 2016. Therefore, we forecast a significant 400 bps decline in the company's EBITDA margins for 2016. However, the margins are then expected to improve about 200 bps in 2017 as the marketing investments start returning back to the normalized levels.Although the significant impact of marketing investments on EBITDA has recently got investors worried and led to analysts turning bearish, we believe that these investments are in line with the company's long-term growth initiatives. The irony is that many of the investors and analysts fail to understand the real value of marketing and they see it only as an expense number. It should be noted that in today's world of continuously changing trends and increasing consumerism, marketing is not an expense but investment, which is necessary for remaining competitive in the long-run. The more e-commerce businesses invest into marketing, the higher their customer acquisition rates will be. And when a customer is acquired before competitors he / she becomes a lifetime asset for the firm as benefits continue to flow from him / her to the firm in the long-run.Source: Company data, PVR estimatesThe derivation of target priceOver the past six months, Groupon traded at an average forward EV / EBITDA multiple of 7.2x, however it is currently trading at a forward EV / EBITDA multiple of roughly 5.1x. If the stock trades at six-month average forward EV / EBITDA of 7.2x, its price will be $3.4 per share assuming an EBITDA of $194 million for 2017. The table below provides valuation metrics used to drive the target price.Source: Company data, Ycharts data, PVR estimatesOur EBITDA estimate of $194 million for 2017 is based on a decline in gross margins from 48.5% in 2014 to stabilization at 44.7% in 2017 due to forex pressures; a fall in adjusted EBITDA margin from 7.9% in 2014 to 4.1% in 2016 owing to significant increase in marketing investments but improvement to 6.1% in 2017 as marketing investments return to normalized levels; reduction in currency impact on revenue growth from roughly 700 bps in 2015 to insignificant impact in 2017; and decline in currency neutral revenue growth to 2.3% in 2015 followed by improvement to 5.3% in 2017. The snapshot from our financial model provided below, reflects these assumptions and financial forecasts.Source: Company data, PVR estimates"
3488116,78265,2015-09-04T12:52:27-04:00,"Shares of Groupon are down about 47% since we published our bearish piece on the company in late December.We're switching to a more neutral stance at this point for a few reasons. The company generates a decent operating yield and the cash hoard at the company is enormous.We can't switch polarity to recommend a buy on the company, as the forward PE multiple is still very optimistically priced.","Shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) are down a gratifying 47% since we posted our bearish piece on the company in late December, 2014. It's now time to revisit the name with an open mind. Our view is that it would be prudent to hold at this point. While we are not particularly sanguine about the future for the long-term prospects of the company, there are some positive trends emerging that would endanger any short trade. We don't recommend buying at this point, but this is certainly no longer the strong sell it was 8 1/2 months ago.Operating ProfitThe first thing we do when analyzing any business is to consider the level of operating profit the company can generate relative to the capital provided by owners. Our reasoning is straightforward enough. If a company can't generate sufficient profit to compensate investors for the risks (both known and unknown) associated with investing in a company, there's no point in conducting the exercise. In the case of Groupon, the operating yield is just shy of 9%. We consider this acceptable, given the risks and other factors present here (the large cash hoard).Source: Company filingsA critic may complain that this is a backward looking analysis and that investors buy a future stream of cash flows and not a past series of cash flows. That's a reasonable critique as far as it goes, but it misses the point. The point of this exercise isn't to provide a history lesson about the recent profitability of a company. The point is to see how near (or far) a given company is from an acceptable level of profitability. For instance, we require an 8% operating yield from companies like Groupon, given the risks we're aware of (and many we can't be aware of). We can also quantify the extent to which operating profits would need to fall before we became nervous. By having a benchmark and reviewing where a given company is relative to that, we quantify our investment process and add some discipline to it.Other FactorsIn addition to the relatively decent level of operating profit, we note the following:For these reasons, we are switching our recommendation from a ""sell"" to a ""hold."" We can't recommend a buy at this point because the forward PE multiple for the company is still a ridiculously high 27.8. It's been a profitable short trade, but share prices can only fall so far before they become a good bargain. We believe shares of Groupon are closer to good bargain territory, but they are not there yet."

More specifically, its results have been dampened by headwinds such as appreciation of the U.S. dollar and deceleration in the North American local business. Nonetheless, we continue to remain bullish on the company’s stock, as our price estimate of $7.57 represents more than a 50% premium to its current market price. We believe the company’s strategies to launch merchant pages, add higher-quality merchants, optimize the mobile experience and transition itself into a pull marketplace could fast-track growth over the coming years. At the same time, we expect the company’s margins to improve over our forecast horizon, as the measures being taken in the goods’ and international businesses pay off in the coming years.Growth Strategies Will Help Drive GrowthPush To Pull Transition Will Bolster Demand: While Groupon began with a push-only model, wherein it sent millions of emails everyday to users, it has been working towards expanding into non-email based marketing channels. This strategy seems to be showing results as active search for deals accounted for almost 30% of all transactions in North America in Q2 2015, as compared to 23% in the corresponding period a year ago. We believe Groupon will undertake similar efforts to expand into other marketing channels in other geographies as well, following the steps taken in North America. At the same time, the rate of decline in the email-based business also subsided recently, and this should help buttress growth in the coming future.Introduction Of Merchant Pages Could Boost Supply And Organic Traffic: Over the past few quarters, Groupon has launched millions of ‘Merchant Pages’, that carry information pertaining to contact information, reviews, maps, and inventory for merchants across North America. The company is also complementing these pages with low-discount deals and market-rate offers to enhance its penetration among merchants. With less than 5% of the target market of merchants currently tied to Groupon, we believe these efforts (if successful) could translate into a significant expansion in the company’s merchant network. Moreover, these Pages will also help bring additional organic search traffic to the company’s websites, leading to more transactions on its platform.The Addition Of Higher-Quality Merchants Could Enhance Popularity: In order to attract national and high-quality merchants, Groupon has significantly reduced its take rate for such merchants. While this move will have an impact on gross margins, we believe the addition of inventory from large-scale merchants will help boost Groupon’s popularity and usage among customers. As a result, this could help Groupon to gain a larger share of the customer wallet in the coming years.Mobile Strategy Will Help Increase Growth: Given the global trend towards rising Internet usage from mobile devices, Groupon’s future growth will largely depend on its ability to penetrate on the mobile platform. We believe this trend will positively drive Groupon’s business, considering mobile users tend to buy more heavily as compared to web-only users. Groupon has seen more than 110 million cumulative app downloads to date, and continues to work towards further optimizing the user experience on its mobile apps.Groupon’s Profitability Is Expected To Improve In The Coming YearsGoods Margins Are Forecast To Rise In The Future: Groupon’s margins are the lowest in the goods’ business, as compared to its local and travel businesses. At the same time, the increasing share of goods’ mix in the overall business has impacted the company’s profitability in the recent past. However, Groupon is taking a number of steps to raise its goods margins, such as raising the number of units per order and moving additional business to drop ship. These measures have started to yield positive results as gross profits (as a percent of gross billings) rose by 200 basis points quarter over quarter in North America to 10.4% during the most recent results. This contributed to more than 80% rise in operating profits in the North American region. We expect these goods’ margins to move towards mid-teens in the coming quarters, thereby leading to increase in the company’s profitability.Though the goods’ margins fell in the EMEA region during Q2 2015, we expect this to a be a short-term issue caused by a temporary shift in the mix of products. Consequently, we forecast margins in EMEA will also rise over our forecast horizon.Losses Could Diminish In The ‘Rest Of The World’ Region: While the rest of the world geographies have contributed negatively to Groupon’s profitability over the past few years, Groupon has taken various measures to restructure its international operations. As a result, the company divested its controlling stake in Korean and Indian operations recently. Owing to these measures, we believe Groupon’s losses in the international region could decrease over the coming years.Disclosure: None"
3532736,67313,2015-09-25T23:12:37-04:00,Groupon looks to reduce global headcount by 10% and exit several international markets.I see this to be a positive move that will likely lead to long-term efficiency and profitability.Remain bullish on Groupon and its position for the global O2O trend.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported that its board has approved a restructuring plan of its international operations, which will result in a 1,000-people reduction in headcount, or 10% of its global headcount. The restructuring is expected to complete within the next twelve months, by which time GRPN will also cease operation in several established international markets. The company plans to book a $35 million pre-tax charge, of which $22-24 million will be booked in the upcoming quarter. In my view, this is a necessary move for the company to improve its operational efficiencies and its long-term profitability. I remain bullish on the stock, as I believe GRPN is a leader in the O2O trend here in North America. Looking at examples in Asia, where large internet companies are investing in O2O and on-demand services/products, GRPN is an attractive acquisition target for companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that have invested considerably in mobile payment.Looking at the fine print, the headcount reduction will focus mostly on critical sales roles, sales support and back-end operation roles. These roles do not have a direct impact on revenue generation, and will eventually have to be let go due to the ongoing efficiency initiatives that the company has been undertaking over the past several quarters. Recall that the initiative was called ""One Playbook"", which is designed to spread several technologies and tools that GRPN implemented in the US to other markets to enhance efficiency on a global scale. This will make GRPN a more consistent platform that offers comparable product and experience globally, a positive for the company's long-term growth.This change will also result in GRPN exiting markets, including Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay, where the ROI is subpar relative to its other operations due to the smaller population base and lack of scale to support GRPN's O2O and on-demand platform. Net-net, this is a positive in that resources could be levered to markets where the ROI can be the greatest. In my view, a more leaner and efficient GRPN is constructive to the company's long-term growth outlook and profitability over time. This initiative will transform the company from a deal mass-emailer to a high-frequency deal platform that commands considerable scale and user base. For the consumers, GRPN will become the preferred mobile deal platform, while merchants will appreciate its mobile marketing platform.In conclusion, I remain bullish on GRPN. The company is well positioned for the O2O trend being seen globally, and the increased efficiency will be likely to result in solid long-term growth."
3523996,89226,2015-09-21T11:51:04-04:00,"The stock has been beaten up by poor cash flow, as well as a top and bottom line decline.
        The stock is presenting itself as a decent acquisition target, as I don’t believe it is going to survive in the long-term.
        There are a few redeeming financial metrics surrounding the company, but not enough for me to tell you to buy in.","We're a good month and a half out from Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) Q3 earnings report and there's a lot to speculate about in terms of where this company is headed. In my personal opinion, I believe this company is a great short opportunity considering of the low value-added component that the service provides; additionally, I believe the company could be a takeover target, which could help to move the stock higher, which has been routed YTD.Below you can see the summer downtrend:Source: StockChartsOrderUpWith Groupon trying its hand at online food delivery, we have to ask a tough question: can it really outpace GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB)? GrubHub has the advantage of an already large and loyal user base, which is credited in part to their merger with Seamless, but also because their acquisitions of DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run are nearing full integration. Additionally, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) both have online food delivery startups in the works. As of now, Amazon Local is gaining traction in Seattle and is planning a domestic rollout shortly.Groupon paid $69 million to get OrderUp and the real kicker is that if somehow OrderUp hits financial goals, the company will need to shell out $20 million to them. So, was the acquisition a good idea? I believe it was, considering they're getting back to their roots to focus on their local merchant philosophy. However, they're going to need a lot more access to this $70 billion market if they expect to capture any potential. The room to run is there - it's all about how they capture it in the coming months, but I believe there are significant barriers to entry that might cause large headwinds for the company.Financial HealthWe should evaluate Groupon's financial health based upon an exclusion of Q4 results, as this is the holiday season and the firm does some exceptionally better from the top to bottom line during this time period. A brief look back at those Q2 results will show some real sadness:What these stats are really showing us is that for Groupon, there is a lot left to be desired. We need to see improvements on both the top and bottom line, as well as in cash flow. Their historically best quarter (holiday season) is right around the quarter and they posted revenue of $925 million last Q4 and we're hoping that they can at least be flat YOY. Its worth noting that as the stock hits the new calendar year, it tends to go on considerable runs.Sell-OffThere's been a lot of uproar in the comments sections on articles pertaining to Groupon, with much of the criticism being directed toward the company's management selling off. Let's take a look at the statistics:Source: NasdaqNow, that's quite substantial and probably worthy of a good amount of criticism. If you add that to the fact that the company currently doesn't pay a dividend, in part because it doesn't have the cash flow necessary, shareholders have every right to be upset. On a different note, there is $500 million authorized through August of 2017 for share buybacks, but I really believe this needs to accelerated if they want to buck short-term volatility and gain some confidence going into the holiday season.An Acquisition NoteGroupon, on a base level, is presenting itself as an acquisition target. The company has $1.11 billion in cash assets and very low long-term debt of $17.25 million. That's an exceptional ratio and with a global platform already established (albeit less lucrative than we want), the integration to another global platform would be streamlined. There's no chatter at all about the acquisition potential of Groupon, but I wouldn't be surprised if management considers it in the coming months.ConclusionThe problem with Groupon is that it now lacks a value-added component in the face of rising competition. Subpar products at slow shipping speeds just doesn't cut it. Tackling the giants Google, Amazon, and even GrubHub, at this point, is not an easy feat and I don't expect them to be able to hold up in that market. If we get to see revenue posted above $750 million, an EBITDA of above $32 million, and a positive net income, I'll consider changing my bear thesis; but, with that trio being unlikely to happen based upon my understanding of the company, I'll remain pessimistic on the stock."
3460156,92156,2015-08-23T17:52:07-04:00,"Groupon has cratered over 50% from its 52-week high established in February to reach levels not seen since 2012.Despite hovering near two-year lows, Groupon’s metrics and business fundamentals are stronger than ever in its history.While all the major indices collapsed over 3% on Friday, Groupon was up nearly 1% on stronger than average volume.","While I'm not a technical trader, I appreciate and reference a number of technical indicators that help me to determine when to enter or exit a position. On Friday, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) demonstrated to me that the buyers strike on Groupon may be over.For months, Groupon has been on a downward spiral dropping from February highs of around $8.30/share to a low of $3.95/share at the very beginning of the trading session on Friday. The chart below shows the price movement in Groupon's stock versus the Nasdaq100 on Friday; below that is Groupon's chart for the last five days. What caught my attention was the divergence between the Nasdaq and Groupon, which is listed on the Nasdaq, after the initial drop at the open. Whereas the Nasdaq moved higher up until 10 am, Groupon initially dropped to $3.95/share, a new two year low, but within moments reversed course to break into the green. After 12PM, Groupon remained well in the green. And despite the major indices plunging in the last hour of trading, Groupon's stock price remained will in the green, finishing the day up 0.74%.This is chart that compares Groupon to the Dow, Nasdaq,Priceline (PCLN) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE). Notice that Groupon is the only stock that had a positive sloping trajectory on Friday.Source: Google FinanceBuyers Strike May Be OverSome analysts have hinted at a possible buyers strike to explain Groupon's crashing stock price despite continued growth (albeit slightly below expectations in the last two quarters). To be fair, there are reasons why buyers have shied away from the stock including: an overhyped IPO, lack of profits, management share liquidation and inconsistent growth. However, all of the above can be said of most growth companies in their early stages. The way the stock has cratered in the last six months, one would think that the company is on the verge of bankruptcy or has been found guilty of a major accounting error. And yet neither is true. The strong support around the low 4s, coupled with continued buying on above average volume (13.84 million versus an average of 11.26 million) seems to suggest that this may be the floor for Groupon and the base for a significant move higher. While I won't rule out the possibility that short sellers may try to push Groupon lower, given Friday's price action it seems that either short sellers are beginning to cover (16.5% short interest) or buyers are stepping up to the plate; if its both, then I don't believe the stock will stay in the low 4s for long.Fundamentals in 2015 are far stronger than in 2012Looking at the chart below, the last time Groupon hit these levels was in late 2012 after Groupon posted results that came well below expectations. In 3Q 2012, Groupon reported $568.6 million in revenue, $25.4 million net operating income, and a net loss of $3 million; analysts expected $590 million in revenue and a profit of $.04 per share. For more details, check out this article.In October 12th, 2012 the stock was at $5.29/share. By November 9th, Groupon hit $2.76/share and by January 4th, it was back to $5.27/share. The stock dropped by half between October to November of 2012 and by February of 2013, the stock more than doubled. For 4Q 2012, Groupon reported a loss of $81 million and the stock sold off 20+% only to rebound after Andrew Mason was ousted and replaced by Eric Lefkofsky and Ted Leonsis as CO-CEOs. More details can be found here. After Eric Lefkofsky, the current CEO, announced that he would remain as CEO of Groupon, the stock price nearly doubled from its Febuary price to $10.61/share on August 9th.Given the historic volatility of Groupon's stock price, it isn't surprising that many retail and institutional investors are wary of the name; by the same logic, it doesn't surprise me that Groupon is a favorite among short sellers. Groupon's stock price hit an all time high of $26.19 (artificially propped up by a very small float) in November 2011 only to crash to an all time low of $2.76 one year later. And nearly three years after, Groupon's stock price has returned once again to these low levels.Below is a quick table I complied to compare Groupon's performance since 2012. All of the data has been pulled from various quarterly and annual reports that Groupon publicly releases.Data from Morningstar.comSince FY2012, Groupon has nearly doubled units sold, more than doubled app downloads, and as of 2Q 2015, search represents 30% of their business. Search is crucial to Groupon's business going forward as it demonstrates the viability of their local marketplace concept; the higher the percentage of search, the greater the probability of increased conversion of its already large monthly unique user base (150+ million globally). Active deals have increased over 1,270% from year end 2012 to 2Q 2015.Customer spend has decreased slightly, but part of that has to do with the loss of Ticket Monster, which Groupon sold off their majority stake this year. Ticket Monster, the second largest daily deals company in South Korea, was a major revenue generator for Groupon; this is why the company's yoy expected revenue growth from 2014 to its FY2015 target (stripped of TMON's contribution) is mostly flat. Another reason why customer spend was lower in 2Q 2015 ($133 versus $155) is that 2Q 2015 does not include the Christmas holiday season, unlike the FY2012 and FY2014 numbers. The company historically posts revenues 20-25% higher in Q4 than the average of the remaining three quarters. Both Operating and Free Cash Flow have increased by about $100 million each from year end 2012 to 2Q 2015 TTM. Groupon's management noted in 2Q 2015's conference call that they would be focusing their marketing efforts on increasing dollars spent by their most active users as opposed to relying solely on active user growth.Given the substantial improvements across nearly every metric, it seems a bit unjustified that Groupon's stock is trading at the same low levels of 2012. Below is a breakdown of the mean, median, high and low of analysts' price targets for Groupon. All are well above the current $4.10/share that Groupon is trading at. I typically don't put a great deal of faith into these price targets, but they are helpful as a reference point.Price Target Summary from Yahoo.comThe Mean and Median Targets represent a 50% increase over the current share price, while even the low target represents a 25% increase.Look for Upcoming CatalystsUpcoming catalysts include: announcement of a new CFO to replace Jason Child, who left the company in June of this year; accelerated buybacks (as of 2Q 2015 there is a remaining $461 million left on repurchase agreement); better than expected 3Q 2015 results and/or revised upward guidance. Here I would note that 2Q 2015 local billings growth in North America was below expectations at 8%. Management stated confidence that they would achieve double-digit growth for NA local billings. Given that the conference call was around August 7th, roughly five weeks into Q3, I believe it is very likely that Groupon will achieve this target. Any upside surprise in growth can send shares up significantly (20%+) from these levels. It's also worth noting that Q4 is Groupon's strongest quarter and with increasing margins in Groupon Goods (10%+ as of 2Q 2015) and a better handle over expected demand (Groupon has been caught unprepared in the past by greater than expected demand during the holiday season), it seems very plausible that the stock may move up in anticipation of stronger sales due to the holiday season.For macro oriented investors, it is important to note that Groupon's strongest and most profitable market is North America. It has no significant operations in China and given that its primary selling point to the consumer is its value proposition, Groupon represents a compelling play despite fears of a global slowdown.By the same token, any downside surprises or deceleration in growth will likely push the stock lower. However, given that the company is trading under 6X EV/EBITDA (FY2015 Guidance), Price/Sales of .85x with over $1 billion in cash, almost no debt, and operating cash flows of nearly $300 million, any drop will be small and short lived.I have laid out my thesis in other articles as to why I believe Groupon will make a strong long-term investment given its dominant position and overall opportunity in local O2O commerce. My point in this article was to demonstrate why I believe Groupon's current stock price represents a compelling bargain. Whether you're a long-term investor like me or a short-term trader, there is substantial profits to be made here in the next three to six months.For investors looking to initiate a position with limited downside risk, I would recommend buying LEAP call options expiring in January 2017 around the $5 or $5.5 range."
3462796,24157,2015-08-25T09:30:00-04:00,"With tech bubble like valuation's in the IPO market, time has come to better examine IPO accounting.Many loopholes exists for pre-IPO companies that allow them to appear more profitable.Disclosures are also limited and can include large conflicts of interest.","Warning of tech-bubble-like overvaluation in the IPO market, we've previously put recent IPO companies Wayfair (NYSE:W), Box (NYSE:BOX), and GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) in the Danger Zone. This week we're turning the tables and putting IPO investors in the Danger Zone as we reveal many of the hidden dangers of IPO investing today.Accounting Loopholes for Pre-IPO CompaniesMost investors do not know that accounting rules are different for pre-IPO companies than for post-IPO companies.Possibly the biggest difference is in the treatment of employee stock compensation, which creates a loophole that enables companies to drastically understate option expense and overstate earnings in their pre-IPO filings. Because there is not yet an ""official"" value for the company's shares, options grants are recorded at highly understated values, especially relative to IPO prices. For instance, Guidewire (NYSE:GWRE) reported option expense of $6,680,000 in 2011. One year later, GWRE reported option expense of $18,258,000 after the company went public despite the number of options granted halving over the same time.Proof of the this misleading practice manifests when, immediately following the IPO, stock compensation expense shoots off the chart as the company has to eventually recognize the more appropriate cost for the pre-IPO stock compensation. As can be seen in Figure 1, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), a previous Danger Zone stock, had stock based compensation expense increase from only $115,000 in 2009, two years before its IPO to $93,000,000 in 2011 after going public. The irony here is that the number of options granted declined precipitously from 14,500,000 in 2009 to 158,000 in 2011. Meanwhile the reported accounting option expense skyrocketed.Figure 1: Groupon Stock Based Compensation Post IPO Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsLimited And Conflicted Disclosure Is A Red FlagUnder the JOBS Act, any company with gross revenues below $1 billion is subject to less stringent reporting requirements. ""Emerging growth"" companies receive the following disclosure ""benefits"":1. Underwriters participating in the IPO are allowed to publish research reports and make public appearances regarding the company. Let us remind you that investment banks have a serious conflict of interest when it comes to research in general, and specifically IPO's.a. In 2003, 10 Wall Street banks were fined $875 million for maintaining inappropriate influence over research analysts during 1999-2001.b. In 2012, Morgan Stanley and other underwriters profited nicely as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) dropped on IPO day.c. In 2014, 10 Wall Street banks were fined a total of $43.5 million (WSJ subscription required at link) for offering favorable coverage to Toys R Us in hopes of underwriting its IPO.2. Following the IPO, the newly public company is not required to have an independent accounting firm audit the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.3. Only two years of audited financial statements (compared to three for other companies) are required to be provided to investors.4. Only scaled executive compensation information for three executives is required and a compensation discussion & analysis is not necessary.5. The exemption from detailed compensation disclosure continues post-IPO and the newly public company is not required to hold ""say-on-pay"" voting for their executive compensation arrangements.These benefits provided to smaller companies are not benefits to investors by any stretch. Rather, they look more like benefits to underwriters. We thought reporting rules were to help investors not underwriters.""Adjusted Earnings"" Paint False PictureWe've previously put non-GAAP earnings in the Danger Zone, and, in a throwback to the tech-bubble days, we're now seeing the practice of marketing non-GAAP results become more prevalent with IPO companies. GAAP earnings are not perfect, (see the 30+ adjustments we make to GAAP earnings here), and non-GAAP or pro-forma moves the focus even farther away from the cash truth. In 2014, according to Audit Analytics, 40 companies went public reporting losses under traditional accounting rules but recording profits using their own adjusted measures, which represented 19% of all U.S. IPO's for the year. The following are just a few examples of adjusted earnings portraying companies in the best light possible.In 2011, during the run-up to Groupon going public, the SEC requested the company remove an adjusted measurement, which Groupon called ""adjusted consolidated segment operating income,"" or ASCOI from its S-1. This adjusted measurement of a GAAP approved metric, consolidated segment operating income, removed acquisition costs, stock based compensation, and most importantly, subscriber acquisition expenses. Groupon's CEO at the time defended the removal of marketing expenses related to subscriber growth because ""they are an up-front investment to acquire new subscribers that we expect to end when this period of rapid expansion concludes."" Not surprising, ASCOI showed Groupon earning $81.6 million in the first quarter of 2011 while GAAP net income showed a loss of $117 million.We've previously written about the issues at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and their use of adjusted EBITDA during their IPO process should have made investors think twice. Twitter reported a GAAP loss of $79 million in 2012 compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $21 million. Aside from depreciation and amortization, Twitter chose to present its adjusted EBITDA after the removal of over $25 million in stock based compensation expense. The company essentially removed the cost of paying its employees to appear profitable. Unfortunately for Twitter and early investors, business doesn't work that way and Twitter's share price has recently reached all time lows.In early 2014, Zoe's Kitchen (NYSE:ZOES) received a request from the SEC much like that of Groupon above. In its S-1, Zoe's featured its ""adjusted EBITDA"" in the MD&A section before providing earnings that followed standard accounting rules. Under this adjusted EBITDA, Zoe's reported a profit of nearly $11 million in 2013 despite a GAAP net loss of nearly $4 million. In calculating adjusted EBITDA, Zoe's removed equity based compensation, management and consulting fees, and expenses related to opening new restaurants. Much like the two examples above, Zoe's was removing significant costs of doing business to appear profitable.IPO Investors Don't Care About ProfitsIn what may be the most saddening theme of all, it's becoming obvious that most IPO investors don't care whether new IPO's even make GAAP or non-GAAP profit. As can be seen in Figure 2 below, over the past three years, we have witnessed over 60% of all IPO's involving companies with no GAAP profits. The last time levels were this high was back in 2000, and we all remember what happened that year.Figure 2: Percentage of IPOs Without ProfitsSources: Prof. Jay Ritter, University of Florida, New Constructs, LLC and company filingsIPO investors need to be careful. IPOs are one of Wall Street's most profitable activities.

3390145,45951,2015-08-03T10:48:01-04:00,"Groupon has experienced a serious decrease in its share price since the beginning of the year.Right now, the company is dirt cheap from a historical perspective.It might be the time to buy at these depressed levels before earnings on August 7.","Since Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) sold a majority stake in its TicketMonster Unit, the share price tumbled to historical lows. It went from $8.18 in April to $4.82 right now, having decreased by more than 40% in a couple of months. The market was expecting more from this deal but it fails to realize that it was actually a good deal to Groupon. While it decreases total revenues reported, it strengthens the balance sheet and enhances the cash position. In this article, I'm going to explain why I do believe Groupon offers a tremendous value at these depressed prices going forward.Groupon trades at historical low multiples as you can see in the below graphs. Enterprise Value to Revenues hits record lows at 0.71, while the historical average is at 1.33. Over the years, Groupon has been growing its revenues base from $1.61 billion in 2012 to $3.2 billion in 2014. For 2015, the company provided a guidance of $3.15 to $3.3 billion (after excluding the TicketMonster unit from reported sales).The company is still in a growth phase: growing revenues is one of the management's priorities to develop the business, before reaching a critical mass to start monetizing it appropriately. Excluding foreign exchange turmoil, Groupon is still growing at a 10% pace and is likely to continue going forward. In fact, the company is pursuing different investment opportunities to deliver additional value from its customers. It has recently bought out OrderUp, a food delivery service.Groupon CEO Lefkofsky wants to build a global marketplace where customers can buy everything at a discount. He tries to capitalize on Groupon's existing customer base to add additional services to leverage the existing platform and add to the bottom line. When the market starts to realize that Groupon could be very successful in this strategy, the share price will double. The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from its ~50M active users to build a wide range of additional services around its core business of selling goods. This is where Groupon can meaningfully increase its profitability going forward. The strategy is to lure the customers into the existing platform to buy additional services using the same existing architecture.The company is also cheap on an Enterprise to EBITDA perspective as well as on an EV to Free Cash Flow. Right now, the company trades at an EV to FCF of 9.57, which is really low in comparison of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 56.03 EV to FCF as of today. For fiscal year 2014, Groupon generated approximately $200 million in FCF and sits on $975 million in cash and equivalents. Groupon has the financial flexibility to invest in its future, without impacting its financial stability. Right now, the company has a current ratio of 1.31 and no long term debt, which points out its financial soundness. Once again, the share price is dirty cheap on an historical perspective.Regarding the EV to EBITDA multiple, the company trades at 16.17, which is historically low once again.After looking at three different metrics to value Groupon going forward, it seems that the market is inappropriately discounting the company's true value. In fact, CEO Lefkofsky provided an EBITDA guidance of $315 million. If we apply the current multiple of 16.17, we find an Enterprise Value of more than $5 billion. To put things into perspective, current EV is at $2.29 billion. If we use an EBITDA multiple of 25 (in line with historical valuation), we get an astounding $7.8 billion EV. This is why I do believe Groupon should be trading around $7-$8 a share.ConclusionAt these prices, you can buy a growth company at a ""value"" price. The market still has to realize that the company has more value without its majority stake in TicketMonster because it can invest its resources in the core business. Groupon additional services such as OrderUp could offer meaningful value in the future. With the depressed valuation multiples and the big cash position, I do believe Groupon is a buy going into earnings. The earnings release could be the catalyst for the market to wake up in the face of Groupon current valuation.For those who invest with options, here is my opinion. For traditional investors, you could buy half your position at today's price and write the January 2016 Put $4 with your remaining cash allocated to this position. If Groupon trades higher than $4 in January 2016, you will collect $0.27 of premium, if not you will double your existing position at $4. Another solution would be to write covered calls for your entire position.Disclosure: this article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. It lays out my opinion only. Before buying or selling any securities, you should do your own due diligence and meet your financial advisor."
3448286,91235,2015-08-18T10:43:21-04:00,"Since its IPO, shares of Groupon have experienced strong downward trends; investors have lost about 80% since the IPO.Most of this loss is a result of operational inefficiencies and an unfavorable sales mix.However, top line growth has been relatively strong, albeit unstable.Should Groupon translate more top line growth to bottom line growth, the result could be quite profitable.Investors should consider holding their positions, while investors considering opening new positions should wait and see.","The future is never certain.That's why when I see stocks like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) start off with a bang, trail along for a while, and putter out, I don't automatically dismiss the stock. I see potential. And that's what I see in Groupon today.While Groupon's shares started off with a bang from the Company's IPO, with more than a 50% increase during the stock's first trading day, investors who bought the Company's shares at the IPO price and held on were ultimately left to be disappointed. The stock experienced quite a bit of volatility throughout the months, but in a downward trend. Since then, investors who have held have experienced almost an 80% decline in their investment. Talk about a horror story.Source: Stockcharts.comBut why has the share price fallen so far? Taking a look at the Company's financials, investors can see that top line growth has generally been growing in a positive direction, albeit in a volatile manner. Unfortunately, most of this growth has not been falling through to the bottom line, and perhaps that's the reason for investors' discomfort (and therefore the substantial declines in the Company's share price). Since fiscal year 2009, gross margins have declined from 67.6% to 46.4% in the trailing twelve months and have not been steady. Operating income has also seen major ups and downs, with a high of 99% in fiscal year 2012 to a low of -420% in fiscal year 2010, hardly favorable for investors. As a result, net income margin and EPS have also suffered, and every single year since the Company's IPO has yielded negative net income and EPS. Continued years of negative net income have taken a toll on the Company's coffers, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $922.0M as of the end of fiscal year 2014. EPS dilution also is an issue: During fiscal year 2012, Groupon conducted another offering which boosted its shares outstanding from about 360M to 650M. Shares outstanding stand at 675M today.Furthermore, there seem to be some control issues within the Company. Mr. Lefkofsky, Mr. Keywell, and Mr. Mason, in sum, control as much as 49.8% of the voting power based on the ownership of 100% of the outstanding Class B common stock. As such, there is a possibility that the Company's board of directors have been acting against the best interests of the shareholders.So it's quite easy to see why this Company shares stand derelict. But is everything lost?Turning back to the Company's financials, investors can see that growth exists, not just in revenue-the Company's gross billings, which represents the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services, has increased from $5.4M to $7.6M. This yields a CAGR of 18% over two years, not adjusting for the acquisitions of Ticker Monster and other companies. Active customers, which the Company defines as unique customer accounts that have purchased a voucher or product from the company during the last twelve months, has also grown substantially from 40.6M to 53.9M.However, this growth is not translating to bottom line growth. One of the main reasons for this trend is because of the nature of the Company's growth. Breaking down growth by operating segment, investors can see that Groupon's fastest growing segment continues to be its Direct Revenue segment, which has lower margins than the Company's other operating segments. As such, top line growth has been far outpacing bottom line growth and will likely continue to do so in the near- to mid-term.The other main reason is due to the Company decreasing the merchant's share of each transaction executed in order to gain market share. As investors may know, the Company obtains its revenue from taking a share of the vendor's profits, and that percentage has been in decline. This trends is likely to continue as well so that the Company can continue its rapid expansion.All-in-all, things remain relatively somber for Groupon. While most of the impatient investors and speculators have left the game already, those investors with unlimited patience could see their investments turn around in the long term if Groupon is able to translate more of its top line growth into bottom line growth. For investors looking to open a position, I would recommend holding out to see whether or not Groupon is able to turn things around. Should Groupon be successful in doing so, any investment in Groupon could be very lucrative."
3436126,92156,2015-08-14T10:02:39-04:00,"Groupon management often cites Booking.com as an example of a successful vertical built around difficult to aggregate inventory. Is this a fair comparison?In order for Groupon to follow Booking.com's growth trajectory, Groupon will need to focus on growing their Local Business whose commission structure is similar to Booking.com's agency model.Both Groupon and Booking.com enjoy secular tailwinds intrinsic to their core demographics. Like Booking.com, Groupon also operates in fragmented local markets that would benefit from an efficient marketplace.Groupon Goods, while dilutive to margins, sustains and grows the demand side of the marketplace while the supply side expands. Cross-selling between the two is a net benefit.","Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) CEO Eric Lefkofsky has on numerous occasions made a comparison to the growth trajectory of Booking.com, acquired by Priceline (PCLN) in 2005. When hard pressed to explain the vision and endgame of Groupon's local marketplace, Lefkofsky points to the many years Booking.com spent building their inventory of hotels, empowering them to focus their efforts on converting visitors to their site into hotel bookings once they reached critical mass.Booking.com was founded in the Netherlands in 1996 and acquired for $133 million nine years later. The rapid growth of Priceline from the mid 2000s is largely the result of Booking.com's stellar growth. This Fortune.com article is an insightful read on how Booking.com turned Priceline's barely profitable merchant model business into one of the most profitable growth companies in the online travel space.The article points out a number of interesting details about Booking.com and why the business of aggregating hotels in Europe and receiving a 15% commission turned out to be so profitable. To give you an example of the impact Booking.com had on Priceline's growth rates, I've included excerpts from a number of Priceline's annual reports. Between 2004-2006, agency revenues increased 454% while the total cost of revenue was mostly flat and actually declined between 2004-2005.The agency model typically has higher ROI than the merchant model due to the fact that it involves no cost of acquiring inventory, Booking.com is a great example of how successful this model can be. Booking.com created a vertical of hotels throughout Europe where individuals looking to book a getaway could browse an assortment of rooms and make a reservation. Given its no-inventory structure, Booking.com's agency model allowed it to scale at a rate far greater than Priceline's U.S. operations, which relied on buying airline seats and hotel rooms in advance, as typical of the merchant model. Priceline's profitability skyrocketed as hotel bookings increased in Europe, primarily attributed to Booking.com, while cost of revenues remained relatively flat. Between 2005-2009, revenues increased 143% while costs increased only 55%, largely thanks to Booking.com's agency model.How does Booking.com's success relate to Groupon?When one considers Booking.com as a vertical of hotels, the similarity to Groupon's local business becomes more apparent. On the latest conference call, Groupon management announced their intention to merge Local and Travel under the category of Services while keeping Goods in its own category. The rationale is that Local and Travel are similar as they both involve Groupon acting as an agent that takes a commission for connecting consumers to a local service or travel package; this is essentially Booking.com's agency model. Groupon Goods operates in a similar fashion to Priceline's US operations, since in this capacity they both manage and sell inventory.Given the high costs of purchasing and managing inventory, Groupon's margins in the Goods segment are around 10% with their long-term target in the mid teens. As many analysts have noted, Local growth has to outpace Goods growth for Groupon to be profitable. Since growth in local remains muted, the stock price continues to fall. However, I believe this is the type of situation in which long-term investors should be greedy when others are fearful.As I mentioned in a previous article, ""Why Groupon Will Win Local,"" growing the supply side of a local O2O (Online-to-Offline) marketplace is a challenging hurdle to overcome. The process of aggregating inventory and streamlining access to this inventory takes years to develop and hone. However, once a critical level of inventory is reached and market dynamics take hold, it becomes much easier to meet supply with demand and convert visitors into customers. Using Priceline as an example, we can see the trajectory of the company's financial prospects change course after acquiring Booking.com in 2005.In 2002, merchant revenues were nearly $1 billion with agency revenues under $1 million. By 2006, merchant revenues dropped to $900 million while agency revenues passed the $200 million mark. By 2009, merchant revenues totaled $1.45 billion while agency revenues climbed to $868 million. Five years later in 2014, agency revenue came in at $5.85 billion, more than double the $2.19 billion of merchant revenue. In 2005, Priceline's stock price averaged in the mid-to-low 20s and at its high in 2014, it hit 1350 for a 50x gain in less than ten years. My contention is that Groupon has the potential to compound at a similar multiple by focusing on local and travel deals.Similarities between Booking.com's opportunity and Groupon'sWhile the travel and leisure space is quite different than Groupon's core local verticals of Food & Drink, Things to Do and Beauty & Health, there are some noteworthy similarities. Perhaps the most obvious one is that these local verticals are quite fragmented. In the Fortune article cited earlier, the author points out one of the reasons that the European market was such a significant growth opportunity for Priceline: ""Compared with the U.S., a much smaller percentage of travelers book hotels online, a byproduct of the fragmented nature of the European hotel industry. There are far fewer big hotel chains, which means travelers are more likely to be considering stays at independently owned hotels - which rarely have their own websites.""Fragmented markets are inherently inefficient. Inefficiency creates opportunity for investment with the prospect of significant capital appreciation. The stock market is a prime example of this dynamic. All of Groupon's verticals are fragmented and many of these businesses have limited, if any, online presence. Having a website is a good first step, but if prospective customers cannot find it among the hundreds of higher ranking search results on Google, what good is it? How many local businesses have the time and resources to dedicate to SEO and SEM? In this area, Groupon's local marketplace offers a strong value proposition similar to Booking.com. In return for a share of revenue generated, Groupon will grant local businesses access to its platform and its millions of active customers.The second point of similarity is that there are secular tailwinds that will benefit many of the verticals Groupon operates in. The Fortune article mentions that one of the reasons Jeffrey Boyd, Priceline's former CEO, targeted Europe was that Europeans typically have twice as many vacation days as Americans and they tend to use all of them. The millennial generation with its emphasis on play, fun, health and wellness is a demographic that favors Groupon's business model and local marketplace. The importance of exploration, fun and self-discovery is something that will continue as the millennial generation delays adulthood, marriage and family formation. As such, it seems reasonable to believe that Groupon's local marketplace will continue to gain traction from a crowd that is increasingly looking to get the most bang for their buck as they search for fun and enriching experiences.Growth in Local is Bumpy - Enter Groupon GoodsUnfortunately, for Groupon investors, local O2O commerce is a tough nut to crack. Unlike online travel and leisure, which are fairly mature online markets with relatively straightforward transactional relationships between business and consumer, most of Groupon's verticals are more complex in nature. How does one price a deal for a session with a chiropractor, plumber, or a day trip to a local jazz festival? The efficient market dynamics one expects of a mature marketplace are not yet in place for most of Groupon's verticals.Furthermore, redeeming Groupons is not as seamless as management intends it to be. For some, the unpleasant experience of realizing their Groupon has expired keeps them from purchasing another. Local businesses are reluctant to discount their services in fear that this will degrade their business. All of these concerns are legitimate and plausible explanations for Groupon's slower than expected growth in the last few years. However, these hiccups are natural for an immature market. As Groupon's local marketplace grows and matures, these problems will be addressed and growth will accelerate as it did for Priceline, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and many other online marketplaces.The maturation of the market will take time and given the impatience of most investors today, management has to come up with solutions to reignite growth. Groupon To Go is one such example that I will explore in future articles. Another segment that continues to show solid growth is Groupon Goods. Despite its lower margins, management is committed to growing the Goods business because it completes their vision of an end-to-end marketplace in which an individual can find what they want when they want, whether it's an umbrella (an oft-used example by CEO Lefkofksy) or a slice of pizza.Many criticized the launch of Groupon Goods as a desperate attempt to reignite growth for the company given the stagnation in their local deals operation. While I believe there's truth to this argument, I also believe that having a strong e-commerce channel is a net benefit to Groupon's local deals business. In order to keep the demand side of the equation strong, Groupon needs to continue to present attractive deals to their consumers. Groupon's strategy is to complete an entire eco-system of commerce on their local platform that will continue to drive traffic to their marketplace and increase the chance of conversion.The 15% off Local deals promotional code that comes with any Groupon Goods purchase is an example of management using the high volume e-commerce channel to incentivize and drive local purchases. While dilutive to margins, Groupon Goods gives customers more reasons to shop and browse through Groupon's local inventory. Ultimately, management's aim is to have Local growth outpace Groupon Goods as the former is far more profitable than the latter. To put things into perspective, Booking.com operated for nine years, building their inventory and customer base in Europe, before being acquired by Priceline and achieving levels of profitability that likely surprised even management's highest expectations.If the comparison is a fair one, Groupon's local marketplace will require time to build out and will likely be much more robust in the coming years. In the meantime, Groupon is making smart local plays, like Groupon To Go, that remain in their core competency. While not an exact match, there are enough similarities between Booking.com and Groupon to suggest that the latter has the potential to experience the kind of growth demonstrated by the former."
3432766,92156,2015-08-12T12:25:37-04:00,Groupon's target market is massive. Local O2O commerce is a trillion dollar-plus opportunity in North America alone.Aggregating local supply is far more challenging in local O2O commerce than it is for traditional e-commerce. Criticism of management execution should be considered within this context.Threat from copycats and Big Tech is overstated. Groupon's sticky merchant base and local deals marketplace is difficult and costly to replicate.Groupon's brand perception is tied to local commerce which is an unappreciated competitive advantage. Consumer perception of brands dictate buying habits.,"I have been an investor in Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) for almost two years now and while it's been quite the roller coaster ride, the experience has taught me a great deal about patience, business analysis and risk management.In this article, I provide a brief overview of the opportunity in local O2O commerce and present two qualitative arguments as to why I believe Groupon is uniquely positioned to maintain their dominant position in local commerce. While the argument for a long-term investment in Groupon is a complex one that requires far more analysis than this article can provide, I hope this will be the first of a series of articles on Groupon's business model and their competitive position in the vast and growing space of local commerce. My intention here is to provide a macro overview of Groupon's position and opportunity in local while also addressing some of the common bear arguments against Groupon.Local O2O Commerce is a Trillion Dollar Market in North America AloneLocal O2O (Online-to-Offline) commerce is one of the largest, if not the largest, untapped markets in the world. By most estimates I've read, it's over a trillion dollar market opportunity. The local marketplace is a tremendous opportunity but comes with a number of inherent challenges that have made the opportunity difficult to capitalize on.Companies such as Groupon, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and even bigger players such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all operate in the local space. By their own estimate, Groupon has reached less than 10% of a targeted 4 million merchants in North America. In 2Q 2015, backing out 75,000 coupons, Groupon had approximately 165,000 active local deals in North America (240,000-75,000). Currently, they have about 2 million Merchant Pages released and indexed into search engines. The ratio of Active Deals to indexed Pages is approximately 8%, which means that over 90% of merchants Groupon seeks to target have no active deals available. Needless to say, the opportunity to build out the supply side of their local marketplace is enormous.On the demand side of the equation, Groupon has approximately 160 million monthly unique visitors globally and approximately 77 million in North America alone. Their annual active customers for the trailing twelve months is 23 million in North America as of 3Q14. If the numbers are accurate, Groupon is only converting about 2.5% of unique visitors per year into active customers who make at least one purchase in a twelve-month period.As management has mentioned before and reiterated on the latest conference call, there are two ways to increase gross billings: either increase the total number of active users and or increase the number of dollars spent for their most active users. The TTM billings per active customer was $135 for 2Q 2015 versus $136 2Q 2014. To give some context the average AMZN customer is reported to spend approximately $625 a year (Non-Prime) and $1,500 (Prime). Again, the opportunity for Groupon to grow is substantial. On both the supply and demand side, Groupon is in the early innings of local market penetration.The Challenges of Local Commerce: Aggregating and Building InventoryLately, with the crash of Groupon's stock price, I've noticed a number of negative comments regarding the perceived failure and lack of vision among Groupon's executive team. While I agree that management has taken some questionable actions regarding compensation (cashing out of Pre-IPO venture funds and substantial automatic stock sales), I believe the overwhelmingly negative response to GRPN management on the execution front is a bit excessive.I believe management's execution efforts should be considered within the context of the unique challenges of local commerce. Local commerce is diverse, fragmented, and lacks the predictability of e-commerce. Mom and pop stores, salons, restaurants and freelance contractors traditionally don't have the resources or time to keep up with the latest developments in online marketing and advertising; as such, bringing them onto a platform such as Groupon's requires significant marketing and sales efforts.Unlike e-commerce which has grown tremendously over the last two decades, local O2O platforms such as Groupon's are relatively new and merchant adoption has been slower than expectations. I agree with management's contention that Groupon's growth is held back by a lack of diverse and high quality local inventory (merchant deals) rather than intrinsic demand. The fact that only 2.5% of monthly unique visitors make a purchase suggests to me that most people who visit Groupon don't find enough of what they're looking for, which is something CEO Eric Lefkofsky notes often on conference calls.Groupon relies on a substantial sales force to build and maintain merchant relationships all while communicating the value added of Groupon's services. In addition to building these relationships, Groupon has had to master the specific dynamics of each vertical (food & dining, activities, services and health and beauty), which is one reason why aggregating supply has been far more challenging for O2O marketplaces such as Groupon than it has been for traditional e-commerce platforms such as Amazon or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Building a marketplace of local deals is not as simple as uploading pictures and details of a product and establishing a selling price. It requires an understanding of the particular services that a local business offers, the behavior of its customers, and the dynamics that govern the transaction between these businesses and their customers.For example, a restaurant can run a Groupon deal and attract thousands of new customers; however, if the restaurant is unable to handle the huge influx of traffic that such a deal might bring, both the business and the customer suffer. In the past Groupon has succumbed to such execution errors; however, given the growth and high retention rate of their merchants relationships (over 75% according to management) in the last few years, I believe that Groupon has learned and improved upon their past mistakes. As a long-term investor, I was pleasantly surprised to hear management comment during last year's Investor Day that over 80% of deals were immediately profitable for their merchants.One of Groupon's Unique Market Opportunities: FreelancersIn 2012, Groupon rolled out Deal Builder, which allowed smaller merchants (including contractors, freelancers and sole proprietors) to build their own deals, bypassing the need for a sales rep. According to the 53 million study conducted by Freelancers Union, an organization dedicated to advocating for and empowering freelance workers, there are approximately 53 million freelancers in the US contributing over $715 billion in annual earnings. Having worked as a freelancer in a variety of capacities at various points in my working life, I've experienced firsthand the challenge of acquiring new clients/customers and especially the difficulty of maintaining a stable and steady pool of potential clients. Groupon's unique value proposition for freelancers is providing access to a massive pool of potential customers.The beauty of Groupon's model is that it requires no upfront costs and is inherently transactional in nature. Instead of paying for advertisement and hoping those precious ad dollars attract new customers, freelancers who promote their services on Groupon only pay (in the form of a revenue share with Groupon) if a customer agrees to purchase their services. Initial services are discounted with the assumption that future services will be sold at market rates. Groupon's current take rate for these types of local deals is 50%.If Groupon manages to take just 1% of this market with its $715 billion in annual earnings, that would translate into approximately $3.5 billion in revenue (1% of 715 billion @ a take rate of 50%) in North America alone. For context, in 2Q 2015, Groupon's NA local revenue was $172 million, with TTM local revenue around $680 million. Even if they only captured one tenth of one percent (.1%) of the $715 billion that would equate to roughly $350 million in annual revenue or roughly half of their current TTM NA revenue as of 2Q 2015.Recently, I've noticed more of these small, freelancer type businesses on Groupon (videographers, tutors, accounting services, photo booth services, DJ etc.) Anecdotally, the transaction volume isn't as large as Groupon's bread and butter verticals such as restaurants, things to do and spa & beauty, but it is growing. Groupon will continue to optimize and streamline Deal Builder to make it even more effective for freelance types. As Groupon's brand awareness grows among freelancers and smaller merchants, I believe the volume and growth of these transactions will accelerate. While I admit there is a degree of speculation in this analysis, my point is to paint a macro picture of Groupon's potential opportunity based on the freelancer market, which is a subset of the overall local services market.Threat of Competition from Copycats and Tech Giants is OverblownThe most common bear argument is that Groupon's business model is easily copied and thus large e-commerce and social networking companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook can easily overtake and dominate Groupon's current leadership position in local NA O2O commerce. There are a number of problems with this argument that I hope to address in future articles, but for now I will point out two weaknesses in the bear thesis that rarely get mentioned: the intrinsic barriers to entry of local commerce and the power of Groupon's brand as it relates to local.The local space, at first glance, seems to have very few barriers to entry as evidenced by the number of daily deal copycats that have emerged since Groupon exploded on the scene a few years ago. The reality in 2015, however, is that most copycat daily deals sites have either folded or have been bought out. In the daily deals space, Groupon and LivingSocial are the only major players, with Groupon leading by a very wide margin. Yelp focuses on local advertising and GrubHub merged with Seamless to dominate the online food ordering/delivery space, which Groupon is now looking to compete in with Groupon To Go.Google and Facebook ended their local deals offerings and Amazon has a tiny operation that seems more like an experiment than real competition. Local is hard to win in and only those who have scale can continue to operate in the space. To illustrate this point, I would recommend this article that explains why Order Up's Co-Founder and CEO Chris Jeffrey ultimately decided to accept Groupon's buyout offer. The gist of the article can be summed up in this quote: it is ""(expletive) hard to make money."" Local, like many industries, is only profitable for operators who benefit from economies of scale. The continued consolidation in the local space is a testament to this fact.High Cost and Low Immediate Profitability Deters Big TechGroupon has a 5,000 person strong global sales force whose function is to develop new merchant relationships as well as manage existing ones. The local space is all about relationships, which is one reason why consumer reviews are vital to businesses in the O2O market such as Uber, AirBnB, Yelp etc. Reviews are a proxy for relationships that would otherwise take time to develop; they establish trust that is necessary to ensure a smooth delivery of services. While the demand side of O2O is relatively simple to aggregate, the supply side is not.Even O2O businesses focused on verticals with relatively simple dynamics such as AirBnB and Uber required significant sales forces and time to penetrate their local markets. Even though Groupon is developing automated tools such as Deal Builder, they still require a sales force to reach local businesses that don't fit an easily defined template. Typically, these businesses are able to negotiate more favorable take rates and craft deals that will ensure the likelihood of execution success and profitability. As Groupon continues to grow and master the dynamics of the various verticals they operate in, they will get more efficient at scaling supply, which means lower merchant acquisition costs and SG&A expenses.As a side note, for those interested, I would recommend listening to the 2014 Investor Day webcast, which is available on Groupon's IR website; about midway through there is a merchant panel of three merchants in the Chicago area whose businesses benefited substantially from Groupon's unique ability to drive traffic to their businesses. Each of these merchants worked with a sales rep to craft their deals that brought immediate ROI.I believe that the high cost of building merchant relationships through a dedicated sales force deters large tech players from directly competing in this space. While Facebook, Amazon and Google have more than enough cash to compete in this space, the reality is that they have far more profitable opportunities within their core competencies to pursue. The process of building a real time local marketplace is costly and not immediately profitable, which is inherently a deterrent for tech giants.Groupon's First Mover Advantage: Sticky Merchant RelationshipsWhile the daily deals fad has waned, the growth of Groupon's local marketplace of deals has not. The important thing to remember is that each deal represents a relationship with a local merchant and even though a given merchant may not have an active deal at present, the relationship is ongoing. On the latest conference call, Groupon's CEO mentioned that over 75% of their merchants choose to have active deals on an ongoing basis. Once a relationship is established for local merchants, so long as the relationship is a positive and profitable one, there is little reason for a merchant to switch.For example, restaurants typically have long standing relationships with their suppliers and vendors; wedding venues typically have a list of their go to vendors for music, catering and photography. Local is all about relationships and good relationships are inherently sticky. As Groupon grows their already sizable merchant base and continues to offer value added services such as POS with Breadcrumb, CRM tools with Groupon OS and real-time deals with Pages, I believe the stickiness of merchants on the Groupon platform will remain strong.Groupon's Brand is Inherently LocalThe perception of a company's brand is an important intangible asset that can either make or break the long-term success of a business. Coach (COH), a company that I follow closely, is in the midst of a turnaround necessitated by a series of management missteps that resulted in a tarnishing of their brand image due to excessive discounting. For a luxury brand such as Coach, the perception of exclusivity that comes with high priced and well-crafted designer goods is vital to their business model. While discounting improved sales in the short term, it eventually pressured margins and ultimately led to a weakening of Coach's perception as a luxury brand. Once the brand was damaged, consumers turned to competitors such as Michael Kors (KORS) and Coach's sales tumbled. As this example shows, brand perception has the power to shape consumer habits.Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) brand conveys cool, beautiful and approachable technology, Facebook is social connectivity, Amazon is efficient and inexpensive online shopping, Google is search and free online tools (Gmail, Docs, Maps), Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) is high-end jewelry, and Nike (NYSE:NKE) is athletic shoes. These are generalizations of course, but this tendency to encapsulate and reduce companies to their core competencies is precisely how consumers subconsciously make sense of businesses and their brands. It is because of this tendency that I believe Groupon's brand has a significant competitive advantage in local. The name itself combines local community (Group) with value (Coupon).While Groupon has had its share of hiccups (overhyped IPO and execution problems), the fact that Groupon has continued to significantly grow their user and merchant base since going public while out maneuvering competitors such as LivingSocial is a testament to the power of their brand. Groupon's long-term vision is to build a local, real-time marketplace. Groupon's brand perception gives them a unique competitive advantage due to the natural association of the brand with its core competency of local deals. This natural association is the foundation for creating the ""habit of Groupon"" that CEO Eric Lefkofsky likes to mention in conference calls. In order for large tech competitors to supplant Groupon's leadership in local commerce they would need a brand that communicates local commerce as strongly as Groupon does. This, I would argue, is something Facebook, Google and Amazon cannot easily do. Once a consumer has a perception of a brand, it is difficult and costly, if not impossible, to change."
3395705,40781,2015-08-05T12:55:35-04:00,"Groupon is set to report earnings on Friday and why I believe shares will jump.How to play Groupon heading into earnings.At current valuation, the upside in Groupon outweighs the downside.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), a global leader of local commerce, will release its second quarter financial results on Friday.After beating analyst expectations for the last three quarters, Groupon looks to continue the trend. So with that, let's take a look at the numbers for the upcoming quarter.Wall Street Expects:While past performance is never a guarantee of future performance, one can still gain a lot from studying the tendencies of past reports. Over the last five quarters, Groupon has beaten expectations four of the last five times -- by an average of $8.8 million. Based on recent history, I wouldn't be surprised to see the top line come in around $745M-$755M.While it's always nice to see the top line beat expectations, another part of the story that investors need to pay attention to is what is taking place on the bottom line. Revenues are great, but profitability is the key. The table below outlines Groupon's earnings per share (""EPS"") over the past year.Thanks to the help of the company's $300 million buyback program over the past year -- $83 million which is still remaining under the first program -- Groupon has managed to beat on the bottom line by 125% over the past four quarters.Also, with the original $300 million buyback program set to expire this month, Groupon announced in April that its has its Board approved a new $300 million share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program is subject to, and will be effective upon, the closing of its Ticket Monster transaction, through August 2017.In the last year, Groupon has repurchased 22 million shares at an average price of $6.75. With shares trading below $6 since June, I wouldn't be surprised to see management step up and buy a bunch of shares like they did in the second quarter of last year.If the company has gone ahead and stepped up its buyback program, then shareholders should see a nice beat on the bottom line.Nevertheless, investors should who can't stomach volatility shouldn't hold shares into earnings based on Groupon's history as we can see in the image below.* Numbers roundedShares have no doubt had some wild swings, with three of the last five quarters posting double digit gains/losses. I expect another big swing and believe it will be on the positive side.ConclusionI've been bearish on Groupon for a long, long time. However, after a 45% drop since March, I believe shares are oversold, undervalued and are quite attractive at the moment.With a market cap of $3.0 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $976 million (as of the latest quarter) -- this means that almost a third of its market cap can be explained just by its cash on hand.Other positives is that Groupon has embraced the mobile world, unlike other companies who are still trying to figure it out. 50% of all transactions come from mobile devices.Active customers, monthly unique visitors, active deals and search traffic continues to grow, not to mention positive cash flow. After bottoming in the second quarter last year, cash flows have come up considerably, and continues to be a strength instead of a hindrance like we saw two years ago (negative cash flow).Also, based on current expectations, I believe the impact of a stronger dollar is already included in Groupon's current share price.Don't forget either that because of how cheap shares have become, Groupon has now become an attractive acquisition target from big players such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FB (NASDAQ:FB) among others.Groupon also continues to reinvent itself to help drive growth, and one of those new areas is in the food delivery service.Following its acquisition of OrderUp in July, Groupon announced Groupon To Go, its nationwide delivery and takeout service. The program will be available in Chicago, where it's been in pilot testing since March, and will then expand to Austin and Boston this fall.I believe this will help give Groupon a much needed initial boost, but it still remains to be seen just how big of an impact it will be in the long run.Last but not least, earnings, for the first time in history, are being released before the market opens. I don't want to read too much into the move, but I believe it's more of a positive sign for shareholders, than a negative one. If they were going to release bad news, I would expect them to do it after the market closes, and to use the weekend to their advantage. This isn't the case, and based on Groupon's current valuation and history, I'm expecting a jump on earnings day.Disclaimer: LinkFollow me on Twitter and on StockTwits"
3300945,23604,2015-07-02T20:07:48-04:00,"GrubHub has just under a $3 billion market cap as an Online Ordering company.Groupon has just ventured into the Online Ordering segment with ""Groupon To Go"", but most investors do not know anything about this.Groupon is sitting on $1 billion in cash, almost no debt, but the CEO fails to provide a clear and positive vision for investors to buy on future value.""Groupon To Go"" is positioned for success despite the CEO not giving shareholders reason to be excited.Both GrubHub and Groupon Online Ordering can exist as the market is far from saturated.","Over the past few years, I have left the trading desk to make a larger investment, purchasing a near bankrupt restaurant. After rebranding, we are now growing towards multiple locations. Leaving the trading desk to be on the front-line in the restaurant industry provides a level of insight I did not have before in this segment. This allows me to see changes and have a stronger, more accurate, perception of certain companies tied into my business.GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is a service we use (for 2+ years now) and we are considered a very high volume restaurant compared to most merchants in the area. GRUB is not a service we need to survive, but it is a nice perk for added sales within our normal business environment. What I mean by that is, we do not have to do extra work for those sales once our menu is inputted into the GRUB system (done by their experts). Everything is business as usual with or without GRUB. While it does cannibalize some of our own existing customers, we've found that is mostly rare. So, it mostly increases our customer reach and bottom line. Of all the services we use, outside of our own online ordering service that we promote first and foremost, GRUB is a great complimentary system for us and it is highly recommended. The customer service is high quality for both consumers and merchants. GRUB does a great job of building relationships with their merchants and consumers (this is a very key point I'll elaborate on later). I believe GRUB has a great future ahead of itself whether it stays with current ownership or it is taken over at some point. This article isn't primarily about GRUB though. It's about a new competitor to it's segment that I believe will be successful, but not cause any significant harm to GRUB simply because the market is not even close to being saturated.Having said that, did you know that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has a service they have just secretly rolled out which competes directly with GRUB? It's called ""Groupon To Go."" Most likely, unless you follow me on SeekingAlpha, you did not know about this. GRPN has been testing this for many months, with multiple delays in rolling it out (was supposed to be rolled out in April), but the time has finally come that is has been rolled out in the Chicago market the other day. The problem is, they haven't truly advertised it yet nor do the 160 million monthly visitors (using 2014 averages) know about it (although only a portion of those are from Chicago). The point being is, if nobody knows about it, why was it even rolled out in the first place? It doesn't take a marketing genius to create buzz over a new service like this. We are not receiving any clarity or vision from the CEO.Not only do the consumers have no idea of this service, but neither does the majority of the investment community at the time of writing this (try searching for it and you'll find very little). You can view this as an open letter to the CEO if you choose to, but it concerns the investors when we do not have a vision for GRPN coming directly from the CEO who is supposed to be paving the path for us towards a brighter future. The stock has been sliding for months now and they have a service that can build future value, providing reason for the stock to better stabilize from sliding as investors start to more confidently buy based on clear future expectations. To be fair, GRUB has also been sliding fast among others in these sectors. It doesn't help these types of tech sectors either when Local Corporation (NASDAQ:LOCM) goes bankrupt (just a few days ago). Half of the odds of your stock movement tend to be how the sector itself is performing.Some bearish articles noted how GRPN has some concerns with an active user base that is slow to grow, but that is why the new version of the GRUB system makes that much more sense and should be touted by management as such to alleviate concerns. GRUB has an active user base that purchases frequently, albeit it is only about a 5 million active user base. Many of those are repeat users ordering multiple times a week making them a very devoted 5 million to the online ordering segment. With GRPN, consumers will be able to purchase ""deals"" as well as regular priced menu items. This will only increase the activity of users above the 48 million mark resulting in even more monthly views (better SEO rankings for direct ordering) and ultimately more transactions.LivingSocial attempted to jump in the online ordering segment and failed. The difference is LivingSocial did not have the funds, technology, know-how, brand awareness or foundational user base to accomplish the task as the uphill battle was too great. Good idea, they just didn't have the resources to fight that uphill battle. GRPN has a strong user base and plenty of capital (with almost no debt), so they have the potential to be the strongest competitor to GRUB in a very short period of time as they are nearly duplicating the GRUB concept as far as I can see, but adding in the ability to purchase ""deals"" with orders going directly to the restaurant instead of having to print it to redeem later. They already have existing (positive/mutually beneficial) relationships with restaurants and strong SEO rankings, so they can move faster in the beginning than other companies would be able to duplicate.Having been able to see the system ourselves, the new platform is not far behind GRUB's system despite GRUB having many years of building their platform. However, GRPN will still need to make some areas more user friendly that comes with time. Little annoyances can be found when comparing the two systems that will have an impact on how happy some customers (the total experience) are with the ordering process. Most of these are relatively simple fixes that shouldn't take long though, possibly in the next few update releases to be remedied (and should NOT be a reason to not advertise the new system properly). The core of the platform looks to be working well and GRPN has done what many seem to fail at, just having the menu inputted correctly without multiple revisions (you'd be surprised how many companies can't do this right). This builds confidence for merchants. It's a shame nobody knows about it yet as the stock continues to slide and the vision is cloudy at best as management doesn't excite the investment community nor present a level of confidence that would instill confidence in investors.Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has also tried to compete in this arena by purchasing Eat24 Online Ordering recently. The problem is YELP destroys relationships with their customers (the merchants are the real YELP customers, not the anonymous reviewers) by allowing a platform of abuse without any repercussion at all. This is called ""Toxic Disinhibition"" where the anonymous are free to maliciously harm others because nothing bad will happen to them. Every week it seems there is another article about how YELP has another fake reviewer caught by a business, further destroying the credibility of YELP as an accurate review site. This abusive platform provides entertainment and power to many. This was studied when the CB radio came out and anonymous people would use it for rather disturbing entertainment. YELP seems to be no different with no plan of action to fix this (even though it would be great if they did as YELP could be beneficial if they would fix this major problem).Instead, they tend to sweep it under the rug as if it doesn't happen. Why would any business want to advertise with YELP (or utilize Eat24) when they allow such abuse to take place without providing any remedy or even empathy? You can't even reach anyone at YELP outside of a local community manager (if you can find them) that may or may not care, but either way these managers are completely powerless to help even if they do care (and some of these managers are truly great people, just no true authority to fix major issues like this). YELP doesn't allow you to even contact them directly (unless you want to buy an advertisement of course). The real customers of YELP, the merchants, don't feel comfortable with YELP. This will limit expectations and that is why I completely disregard YELP as a valid competitor in this industry until they change their philosophy on how they treat merchants.As soon as Eat24 was purchased by YELP, we, among other restaurants, quickly left Eat24. YELP doesn't seem to care about any business, but their own personal pockets, so why would any business want to work with YELP when it's not a mutually beneficial relationship? YELP literally takes your business name without your permission so they can make money off of you. This is why GRUB and GRPN have a leg up because they actually build mutually beneficial relationships and the more business the merchant receives, the bigger the provider (GRPN/GRUB) becomes (win/win). It appears YELP doesn't understand this concept and that is why it's been my favorite short for a while now.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) already trumps YELP in terms of accuracy with their relatively new review system because Facebook is able to rid some of the toxic disinhibition (fake anonymous abusive reviews) with quantity of accurate reviews since they have far more active users than YELP. YELP simply isn't a strong social media outlet (a GRPN active user buys, a YELP user just reads or writes for free so the number is quite low for such a lower definition of active user) to have a significant number of active users which would help remedy their relationship-destroying platform by drowning out the fake ones. That is why, simplistically speaking, YELP's Eat24 platform will likely struggle to gain traction whereas GRPN's platform can gain market share at a much faster rate as merchants actually want to do business with GRPN. In the same breath though, if FB ever enters the online ordering game, it might be able to grow faster than both GRUB and GRPN with the social media foundation they already have, among other resources. This could also make an online ordering company a great takeover target for FB down the road. For all we know, someday, FB could decide to purchase GRPN or GRUB rather than starting fresh. I simply don't know how long away that day may be, but it makes more sense for FB to join in Online Ordering, in my front-line restaurant perspective, than other companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).In terms of valuations (using numbers from Yahoo Finance), GRPN seems the most undervalued in comparison. GRPN's market cap is about the same as their revenue, about a 1 to 1 ratio with a forward PE of 22.50 and $1 Billion in cash. That's a lot of cash to work with and create future value with! Not many businesses have that much capital waiting to be deployed with almost zero debt. Basically, for every $1 in revenue, GRPN is worth $1.In comparison to other companies which are loosely related, this is grossly undervalued. YELP, which has about the same market cap as GRPN despite YELP being considered a dying business by many, has just under an 8 to 1 ratio. So for every $1 in revenue, the company is worth $8, which also has a forward PE of over 88 (4 times higher than GRPN) and a fraction of the capital GRPN has. GRUB has a 10 to 1 ratio with a market cap just under $3 billion (about half a billion less than GRPN) and forward PE of 42 at the time of writing this article (about twice as expensive via PE). FB, considered among the best of the best, is a 17 to 1 ratio and a forward PE of 32. That is because FB has investors buying on future value making it more justifiable. FB investors see the vision and they see the progress. FB keeps attracting more investors as the company continues to monetize and innovate while keeping shareholders in the loop to excite them as well as build confidence. While all these companies could be argued to be overvalued to a degree (this is how the stock market works, how we make money by riding these swings up and down), it's very tough to argue GRPN is currently overvalued when compared to the rest, but GRPN is also not providing a strong story about their future either, so the slide seems to continue in the short-term.The lack of vision (providing future value) is where GRPN fails the most in my opinion. They are not providing a vision, which provides a clear reason to buy. Investors are waiting for something exciting. The story they tell (sell) is old and stale despite having a new GRUB platform that gives reason to see a more positive future with a fresher outlook. Once this system gets rolling, the story will likely sell itself and investors will give this stock a quick jolt upwards (always assuming the overall market doesn't fall apart by that time) as shorts cover (nearly 14% of the float is short, a lot of fuel for upward momentum when they do cover). This is still a falling knife of a stock though (the strengthening dollar hurts GRPN as well which concerns some investment firms), so unless you're riding this short, it's tough to hold long without the correct timeframe (12+ months). The longer timeframe will allow ample time (more favorable odds) for these positive changes to take place and more new innovation to take place since we'll need to see it work rather than be told in advance of exciting ideas. That's not to say it couldn't happen sooner, but when playing odds in the market, you need to consider how long it will take to get the investment community behind it.If GRUB is worth nearly $3 billion by itself (at the time of writing this), just imagine what future value GRPN can garner if they become GRUB's top competitor within the next few years alongside the rest of their business model that is already valued at over $3 billion. This isn't a slam dunk by any means, but odds definitely favor success with what they already built for the new platform. GRPN still needs to properly allocate the right resources (marketing dollars and finding innovative ways to make it easier and easier to order with future updates) towards building this into a top competitor of GRUB, but the market is far from saturated. Both companies can exist just fine as millennials continue to take over the new economy and utilize convenient ordering systems to make purchases.With $1 billion on the side and almost no debt, the CEO would have to almost intentionally fail at innovating the company towards a better future value. I'm betting alongside most investment firms that the 12 month price target is above $8 and as high as $12, according to recent data that likely doesn't even take into account ""Groupon To Go."" The vision should become clear soon enough even if the CEO fails to understand the importance of telling a good story, one of the reasons Steve Jobs was a great leader."
3291785,24157,2015-06-30T09:30:00-04:00,Business model has lead to significantly lowered margins.Middleman business model provides no differentiation.Profits moving in the opposite direction of revenues.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) went public in late 2011 with hopes of revolutionizing the way consumers interacted with merchants. GRPN shares have since fallen over 75%, and we believe they will fall further. A bad business model, lack of profit growth, and extreme competition put Groupon in the Danger Zone this week.Groupon's Initial Business Was Mediocre At BestWhen Groupon went public, it was generating nearly all of its revenues through local coupons and deals. The company acted as a middleman by allowing merchants to offer special deals to its user base, achieving gross margins upwards of 80% in the process. However, this business model had very little, if any, barriers to entry. As more competitors arose, merchants gained more options, leaving Groupon as little more than an undifferentiated online middleman.With no pricing power, Groupon did the only thing it could to keep customers: cut the percentage that it received from each sale. In 2012 Groupon retained 32% of each coupon sale while in 2014 it only retained 23% of each coupon sale. Management even stated in 1Q15:""In order to attract merchants … we have been willing to accept lower deal margins across all three of our segments and we expect that trend to continue.""Figure 1: Expanding a Losing BusinessSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Moving From A Low Margin Business To A Lower Margin Business: From Bad To WorseIn an effort to spur revenue growth, Groupon started transitioning away from its Third Party coupon sales business and more toward its Direct business. Through the Direct segment, Groupon acts as a merchant and sells products in a similar fashion to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), or any other online retailer that sells directly to consumers. Last we checked, Amazon's retail business is not exactly high margin. The declining trend in Groupon's margins looks to continue for a while. See Figure 1.Prior to entering the traditional retail business, Groupon was only able to achieve pre-tax (NOPBT) margins around 3%. In 2014 when gross margins further declined, NOPBT margins followed suit to -0.3%.In essence, Groupon has shifted from a high gross margin business in which it was no longer making a profit to a lower gross margin business where only a few, large-scale companies make any meaningful profit. As Groupon transitions into a traditional retailer, expect margins to continue declining, as the costs of maintaining inventory, fulfilling customer orders, and handling returns and defects becomes even more costly.Slowing Revenue and Declining ProfitsWhile Groupon's shift to retail goods has been able to maintain revenue growth, the same cannot be said for profits. Groupon has grown revenues by 17% compounded annually since 2012, but only by 3% over the prior year in 1Q15. Meanwhile, as could be expected with declining margins, profits have headed the opposite direction. The positive after-tax profit ((NOPAT)) of $42 million that Groupon experienced in 2012 declined to -$6 million in 2014.Figure 2: Profits Moving Opposite of RevenueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Users are Everything and Groupon Has FewMuch like we saw last week in our analysis of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Groupon's business model relies heavily on its user base. Groupon's only differentiating value-add to merchants is access to its user base. However, with only 48 million active users, this value is miniscule compared to that of other players such as Facebook, Twitter, or even LinkedIn. Also, Groupon isn't the only outlet for coupons, as daily deal services can be found all over the Internet. Amazon Local provides the same services, retailmenot.com provides coupons, and livingsocial competes directly with Groupon by providing coupons on products, services, and travel. This group of competitors doesn't even include retailers themselves offering coupons to customers. Without a large user base, Groupon has no competitive advantage with which to grow its business.Is Management Focused on Fixing the Business?To drive future expansion of the business, Groupon acquired LivingSocial Korea in January 2014. With this acquisition came Ticket Monster, a South Korean ecommerce website that sells discounted goods, services, and travel offers. However, in March 2015 the company approved a transaction to deconsolidate Ticket Monster and sell a controlling stake in the business. While Groupon did make a profit on the deal, we question whether the company has sustainable competency in operating like a private equity or hedge fund. Furthermore, this acquisition and subsequent sale did little to improve Groupon's business model, thereby alleviating none of the prior concerns.Bull Case?Much of the bull case for Groupon rests on its ability to continue growing gross billings and revenue. However, as we've seen, revenue hardly grew in 1Q15 and management isn't expecting much growth going forward. In addition, growing revenue is not enough to warrant an investment in this company. We've seen Amazon, widely believed to be the company who revolutionized online retail, operate for years on the slimmest of margins, and still fail to create profits at times. Betting on Groupon to figure it out is betting on a company with a struggling business model to execute better than one of the largest online retailers in ecommerce.Stupid Money (Buyout) RiskGroupon currently has a market cap of $4.1 billion and little debt, so it could very well be a buyout target. However, any company looking to acquire Groupon would either be doing so for its technology or its user base. Its technology isn't anything that couldn't be replicated by any number of competitors and already has been replicated by some. Also, its user base is not large enough to warrant buying a business that is failing to produce any profits and only getting costlier to operate. While anything can happen, we don't see Groupon as an attractive buyout target. With Groupon's low user base, any acquirer would be paying upwards of $85 per user, assuming it bought Groupon for its current market cap of $4.1 billion.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingThe company depressed 2013 earnings, by including $95 million non-operating items in operating expenses. These unusual charges came largely from an $85 million loss on impairment of investments.Without these unusual charges in 2013, the Groupon's NOPAT was a positive $45 million. NOPAT in 2014 fell to -$6 million, much worse than the narrowing loss Groupon's net income showed.Valuation Implies Unrealistic ExpectationsGiven Groupon's current strategy, we do not believe in management's ability to innovate its business model and turnaround the company's declining profits.Even at $6/share, Groupon is vastly overvalued. To justify the current price of $6/share, Groupon must increase its pretax (NOPBT) margin from -0.3% to 3% and grow revenue at 20% per year for the next 16 years. Considering that Groupon is trying to become an online retailer, it is incredibly difficult to expect double-digit revenue growth and 3% margins for such an extended period. Amazon currently manages 0.5% NOPBT margins while Zulilly, a new online retailer, only achieves 2% pre-tax margins. At the same time, this scenario would leave Groupon generating $46 billion in revenue, nearly half the revenue Amazon generated in 2014.If we give Groupon credit for 1% NOPBT margins and 17% NOPAT growth for the next 10 years, the stock is still worth only $2/share today. This value represents a 66% downside from current prices and a 92% downside from its IPO frenzy days.Catalyst for SharesWith declining margins and further expansion into the cutthroat retail industry, Groupon must fully deliver when it reports its next quarter earnings. It is already projecting for revenues to be flat in 2Q15 and anything below expectations will be stronger evidence that this business model is not producing the results Groupon claims it can.Heavy Insider Selling Throughout Groupon's HistoryPrior to its IPO, insiders in Groupon sold a total of $870 million worth of shares. The large amount of insider sales is especially odd since share prices usually appreciate when a quality company goes public. Again, in the third quarter of 2013, insiders sold a net of 299 million shares as the stock fell 27% in a two-month span. Even now, in the past 12 months insiders have bought 681 thousand shares and sold 20 million, for a net of 19 million shares sold. These most recent sales represent ~3% of shares outstanding as of March 31, 2015. If insiders continually sell their own shares, why shouldn't you do the same?Executive Compensation Lines PocketsFor executives to be eligible to receive a performance bonus, Groupon much achieve a predetermined adjusted EBITDA. However, this adjusted EBITDA removes costs like stock based compensation. The exclusion of stock based compensation means Groupon executives are able to pay themselves in equity awards that are excluded from the metric that measures their performance. Not a bad deal. Even more worrisome, in 2014 Groupon was unable to meet this adjusted EBITDA goal but the compensation committee still deemed that all executives should receive an individual bonus due to the company's ""improved financial performance and retention-related factors."" These executive compensation numbers do not add up any way you slice them.Dangerous Funds That Hold GRPNThe following ETFs and mutual funds allocate significantly to GRPN and earn our Dangerous or Very Dangerous ratings.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Max Lee receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, or theme."
3238826,24663,2015-06-05T10:13:25-04:00,"GRPN followed a similar path to NFLX and AAPL during periods of stock turmoil.To reverse GRPN's negative sentiment, it needs a catalyst, or two, something that investors can embrace.GRPN might have just given investors that catalyst.","Investors have found it very difficult to look past the declined gross margin that comes with Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) shift to e-commerce. I wrote about this recently when I compared Groupon to the mind-boggling stock losses that Apple and Netflix saw in the past, a common effect when company's undergo major changes. As I then suggested, Groupon would need a significant catalyst to reverse its trend, that or continue to produce fast-growth in its high margin Travel business (which has not happened). With that said, Groupon might have done just that.Source: wikimediaWhat Groupon did was two things: It promoted North American Chief Rich Williams to COO and increased the size of its buyback program by $200 million to a total of $500 million. Why are these things significant? The promotion of Williams means that he will oversee all operations, not just North America.North America is by far Groupon's largest region, accounting for roughly 60% of total billings. Yet, North American billings during Groupon's last quarter rose 14%, that was far better than both Europe and Groupon's Rest of World business. Williams can now take the practices that have allowed North America to thrive into other parts of the world, which could very well spark billings and revenue growth. Clearly, that's something to be excited about.Next, a $500 million buyback program might not seem like a lot, but it is good for 10% of the company's outstanding shares right now. Not only will that push Groupon's EPS higher, but ironically (since I compared Groupon's stock turmoil to Apple), it gives Groupon's stock the opportunity to have the same effect as buybacks did for Apple over the last two years.As seen above, Apple has bought back approximately 9.4% of its outstanding shares over the last two years. By doing so, and by buying back when the stock was low, Apple's stock has outperformed its market capitalization gains by 25%. In other words, Apple essentially gave investors an additional 25% of stock gains by being so aggressive, and consistent with stock buybacks.Now, I am not suggesting that Groupon's stock will more than double over the next two years. In order to do so, a lot of things have to go right. For Apple, it not only bought back stock but proved to investors that iPhone sales growth was sustainable, margin pressure was manageable, and that it could continue to innovate minus Steve Jobs. Groupon is putting itself in a situation to prove similar concepts. If Groupon can continue to grow its e-commerce business, remain competitive in online travel, and if Williams can make Europe and the Rest of World match North America's growth, the Groupon's stock could very well double.In essence, Groupon's stock has declined more than 75% since its IPO, this despite consistently producing top-line growth. As a result, there is no doubt that Groupon's stock is oversold. The big question is whether Groupon can capitalize on the stock boost that buybacks will create? Personally, I think so, but it's just a hunch. At the very least, Groupon's buybacks will slow the decline in the stock, maybe even causing it to level out. Given this fact, Groupon looks like a good, but speculative stock to own, one with upside that far exceeds the downside."
3152986,67313,2015-05-07T09:24:12-04:00,GRPN's 1Q15 missed on revenue but beat on EBITDA with gross billing growth stabilizing.Take-rate decline a key concern but necessary to drive long-term growth.Remain bullish on the stock. GRPN is the key beneficiary of O2O trend in the developed countries.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported 1Q15 with revenue of $750m and EBITDA of $72.4m vs. consensus $772m and $69m, respectively. North America local gross billing saw a double digit increase, although take-rate continues to deteriorate as GRPN tries to attract higher quality merchants onto its platform. This strategy will most likely pressure take-rate in the near-term but I am more positive on the long-term implications as higher quality merchants are enrolled in the GRPN platform. Additionally, margins could see incremental improvement as management shifts its Goods business to third-party logistics networks, relieving the pressure from GRPN. Overall I would get constructive of the name as increased merchant adoption will likely drive better traction in the local segment, particularly from mobile, and higher consumer engagement from the consumer side due to better selection of products and deals. I acknowledge the near-term challenges to the stock but I also believe it is important to understand the long-term growth trajectory of this company. I believe GRPN will remain a leading group-buy website as its pull strategy appears to be stimulating solid demand. Remain bullish on the stock, which currently trades at 9x EV/EBITDA for FY16 consensus estimates.Steady eddyLocal North American billing trend growth of 12% was a slight deceleration from the 14% last quarter but the consecutive quarters of double digit growth suggests that bill growth appears to be stable. Moreover, I believe this suggests the worst may be over for GRPN which suffered from a series of poor execution over email push marketing. Although I acknowledge the growth is not without cost, the 350bps decline in take-rate suggests that heavy spending was necessary to maintain growth.I believe GRPN's strategy is paying off, with active deals up 10% q/q on the back of improving scale and selection. The pull strategy appears to be working, in my view, and I believe the new initiative such as Pages will become a bigger catalyst for fortifying merchant-GRPN relationships and expanding the platform scale.ConclusionGRPN remains my key top pick within the O2O vertical given its scale, first-mover advantage and brand equity."
3221946,67885,2015-05-29T11:22:02-04:00,"Groupon has been an absolute dog since coming public back in 2011.However, the company's share count has stabilized, allowing investors to focus on the business.With a strong balance sheet and steady growth ahead, shares may be ready to turn higher.The possibility of a takeover adds to Groupon's potential upside.","For the better part of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) public life, shares have done little but go down. The only momentary ecstasy for investors appeared to be a short-lived, post IPO push to $27.78. Then, after falling to less than $3 per share in a straight line during 2012, the stock rebounded to touch $12. However, the move was short-lived, as Groupon quickly gave up most of that move, again trending downward. Now, a little less than four years after coming public, the stock is trading at a 67% discount to its IPO price. Could a bottom finally be in sight or should this stock be thrown away for good?GRPN data by YChartsThe Business ModelGroupon has appeared to create its own very unique, niche marketplace. The online coupon company sells deals that can be redeemed for just about anything one can imagine. These coupons act as flash sales that are available for only a limited time. By offering deals, Groupon doesn't directly compete with discount merchants. Instead, they target impulsive buyers who are looking for a quick deal.The FundamentalsAs with any turnaround candidate, the fundamentals are almost always the most important. Because of this, it's essential to examine Groupon's balance sheet while also examining the company's growth prospects and ability to produce cash.Starting with the balance sheet, it can be seen that Groupon is in very sound financial positioning. The company possesses $975.5 MM in cash and cash equivalents with no long-term debt. Additionally, Groupon has $362.7 MM recorded under current assets held for sale to reflect the sale of a 46% stake in Ticket Monster. After the closing of the deal in the second quarter, the proceeds will be recorded as cash and cash equivalents. With zero debt, the company's net cash position, after the Ticket Monster sale closes, will be $1.26 BB.On a side note, many people are under appreciating Groupon's investment in Ticket Monster, which it purchased in 2014 for $260 MM. In just over 18 months time, the company will have recouped more than their initial investment, while still holding on to a large 41% stake. Given the same valuation, the remaining stake is worth an additional $320.62 MM.With a current market capitalization of $4.41 BB, Groupon's cash position will soon represent 28.5% of the enterprise's value, with the potential to climb as high as 35% on the sale of the remaining Ticket Monster shares. This provides a nice cushion for the stock and should act as a floor if the stock's price were to continue its decline.GRPN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsTurning to growth, Groupon continues to see increases in gross billings and revenue. In the company's latest quarter, both were up only 2% and 3%, respectively, causing some concern. However, on a currency neutral basis, they each would have risen at a 10% clip. Guidance on the revenue front for the remainder of the year of $3.15-3.3 BB also is a bit disappointing, mainly in due to the impact of unfavorable exchange rates. Still, it represents modest year-over-year growth of about 6%. On a currency neutral basis, sales would be projected to grow at a rate closer to 13%.While top-line growth has been perennial, none of it appears to be trickling down to the bottom line. Revenue jumped 40% from 2012 to 2014, yet gross profit and adjusted EBITDA remained relatively flat. However, the tides may be shifting, as Groupon's AEBITDA surged some 56.5% in the first quarter compared to a year ago. Furthermore, the company's 2015 guidance implies AEBITDA growth of 20%, a sign that higher profitability may be coming soon.Additionally, Groupon's business does produce a fairly decent amount of cash. This is evidenced by the company's TTM free cash flow generation of $222 MM. While the rate at which cash is produced may be lumpy from quarter to quarter, Groupon has been able to generate positive free cash flow since the time it came public. I see Groupon's dedication to staying cash positive while growing the business as a major plus.As with most tech companies now a days, active users also are very important and Groupon has shown continued growth in this area. For the trailing twelve months, the company reportedly had 47 MM active users, up 7% from a year-ago. Additionally, the number of deals offered by merchants continued to surge, more than doubling to reach 425,000. This shows that merchants are realizing the value of having their deals posted on Groupon.IPO DebacleAfter seeing that the fundamentals remain strong, how could this once highly anticipated IPO have fallen so hard? It all has to do with the way Groupon came public. The company offered 35 MM shares at an IPO price of $20 per share to raise $700 MM, making Groupon's offering the largest of any internet company since Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) raised $1.7 BB in 2004. However, the number of shares sold in Groupon's IPO were less than 7% of the total outstanding. Such an offering is known as a sliver deal and is designed to drive up the company's valuation following the IPO. It did just that, pushing Groupon's valuation over $12 BB.GRPN data by YChartsThe problem with this strategy is that 93% of the company's shares would eventually flood the market following the post-IPO lockup expiration. When this occurred, the new supply overwhelmed the previous demand, causing shares to plummet. Therefore, much of the pain seen in Groupon's stock has been based more on the new supply than deterioration of company fundamentals.After identifying this, I realized that new stock issuances would be very important. Currently, Groupon is issuing shares for stock-based compensation at a run rate of ~$120 MM per year. However, much of this new stock should be swallowed up by the company's $300 MM repurchase program. The new buyback was announced after the Ticket Monster sale and should, in conjunction with the $83 MM remaining on the old program, allow the outstanding share count to remain flat through 2017.The only remaining obstacle on the share count side has to do with insider selling. CEO Eric Lefkofsky is liquidating his shares at a rate of about 450,000 per month, causing some panic amongst shareholders. However, I would point out that these are automatic sales used to diversify away from a major position (he owns 100,000,000 shares). Therefore, it will take over 18 years for Mr. Lefkofsky to totally liquidate his position at this rate. Noticing his large stake, I believe he is doing right by shareholders to slowly scale out. If he were to completely jump ship all at once, the market would become overwhelmed with supply and shares would plummet as a result. I have no objections to his current liquidation strategy.A Possible Takeover TargetAdding to my belief that Groupon may be about to turn the corner is the possibility of a takeover bid. The stock has fallen so far from its highs that a larger ecommerce company may be tempted to swoop in. Net of cash, Groupon is trading at just 10x 2015 EBITDA, making it fairly inexpensive. Plus the under $4 BB price tag could attract some larger players with deep pockets.There are three major companies that could be interested in acquiring Groupon at these levels - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Each of these internet giants have attempted to invest in or fund a comparable deals-based website with minimal success. Amazon has already poured $175 MM into competitor livingsocial in an attempt to tackle local commerce, while Google and Facebook have tried to build their own competing businesses (both of which were pulled from beta quite early). Before failing on their own, Google did make an effort to acquire Groupon. The rumored offer price valued the business at $6 BB, but Groupon declined to accept the tender.Now, with shares remaining under some pressure and the fundamentals still intact, Groupon remains the largest player in the local commerce space. The failed efforts to imitate the business by two of the largest tech companies on the planet further ads to the company's value. As for livingsocial, the company could present some competition in the future, but currently lacks the scale of Groupon. Therefore, Groupon could offer each of these companies instant access to the local commerce market, all the while producing steady cash flows. In my opinion, Groupon could again command a $6 BB valuation (net of cash) in the event of a takeover.Possible ConcernsThough the fundamentals appear stable and the upside from a takeover target is evident, I do have some hesitations about the stock. The first is in regard to the company's take-rate in North America. While billings have continued to grow at a double digit rate, actual revenue growth has began to lag, causing concern in the analyst community. This appeared to be the result of deep discounts meant to drive traffic. The problem is that this growth is not all demand driven. With a vast array of coupons and deals already being offered, Groupon has to find a way to stimulate demand without cutting prices. If Groupon can find a way to leverage their existing offerings at or near billings prices, then future growth in the company's top and bottom lines will accelerate. Until then, earnings could remain insignificant.Additionally, I have worries about Groupon's foreign sales due to the recent appreciation of the US dollar. In the first quarter, EMEA gross billings took an 1800 basis point hit because of the strong dollar, causing billings to decline 11% year-over-year. Excluding this impact, billings would have increased 7% in a market where the take rate is currently much better than the US. Revenue would have been up 13% in the quarter on that 7% increase, assuming no impact from foreign exchange. Therefore, any depreciation in the dollar could have a large impact on Groupon's top-line moving forward. However, this appears somewhat unlikely as a fed rate hike could be coming soon. In such an event, it is hard to imagine that the dollar would depreciate against other currencies. For that reason, FX may remain a headwind moving forward.ConclusionGroupon's downfall as a public company has been the result of a poorly designed IPO that set the stock up for failure after the company's lockup expired. All the while, the underlying business has continued to grow and remains in a healthy financial position. Over the years many have tried to imitate Groupon's model, but none have been able to replicate it on such a large scale. Therefore, companies looking to reach local commerce markets should look no further than Groupon.The concerns I have regarding the stock are minimal, but relevant. Both the NA take-rate and FX impacts could cause some headaches moving forward. However, a reversal in either could send the stock substantially higher.At last check, Groupon's market capitalization was $4.4 BB. Net of cash, the enterprise is valued at $3.2 BB. After backing out the cash Groupon is trading at ~10x 2015 EBITDA, relatively in-line with its peer group. In my opinion, this makes the stock fairly valued at the moment. However, given the potential for a takeover and the company's forecasted EBITDA growth for the remainder of the year, the stock may have some multiple expansion ahead. I could see investors paying up to 12x EBITDA for the stock, or $7.35 per share. In the event of a takeover, the multiple could expand much more, as Groupon would command a substantial premium to today's prices. I believe an acquirer would value Groupon's stock at $10.60 per share.As you can see, much of the upside at this point is tied to the company putting itself up for sale. For this reason, I'm not inclined to buy shares of Groupon hand over fist just yet. However, I do recommend investors begin to look at the stock for speculative purposes and would be very inclined to start a position as shares continue to slide toward six dollars."

(NASDAQ:GRPN) has seen steady growth over the course of the last few years. The company has been able to familiarize itself with the retail environment in the US, has facilitated buyers aptly, and has seen impressive revenue growth over the course of the last few years. Profitability has been a concern for the company considering its lack of operating experience so far, but the company has managed to cut down losses at a rapid rate and has seen revenues grow impressively amid strong performance from its key domestic segment in particular.The company has also taken advantage of mobile platforms through its own app and has been able to improve monetization and drive subscriber growth as a result. The recovery of the US economy, the increasing popularity of online platforms for retail transactions, and the incredible growth of mobile platforms through the prevalence and consequent dominance of smartphones has helped Groupon grow. Moreover, these factors are expected to continue to drive the company's growth in the years to come as well.Groupon has capitalized on the growth of both online and mobile platforms, and its targeted marketing approach has paid dividends. The company has struggled to generate investor confidence since its IPO in 2011 owing mainly to its inability to generate profitability thus far. Despite its troubles, the company is definitely on the right path and has market trends in its favor. Groupon is expected to grow organically as well, with rising subscriber growth, as a result of targeted advertising, group-based targeting, efficient segmentation, identification with consumers, and attractive discount offers.Potential Upsides for GrouponNorth American businessGroupon's North American business is the crown jewel of its portfolio. The North American segment accounts for 45% of the company's revenues and is its highest value-driving segment along with the highest contributor to the company's revenues. Groupon's subscriber growth in the US has been immense so far, and the company is expected to continue to witness subscriber growth in the North American region, as consumers continue to switch from store buying to online buying.The retail environment in the US in particular largely favors online platforms. Given the strong brand recognition that Groupon has created in the region as well as its strong merchant relationships, the North American segment is thus expected to continue to grow and drive Groupon towards long-term profitability. The company's subscriber growth rate in the US is expected to grow, driven by the rising popularity of online platforms as the retail landscape in the country changes. The continued growth of the US economy will also favor Groupon's growth as disposable income and hence consumption rises.Taking into account an estimated 12% increase in active customers, I calculate incremental revenues of $250 million for Groupon in FY 2015 owing to the growth in North American subscribers. The North American segment is also a key value driver for the company, thus share prices have a definite upside if positive trends in North America are taken into account.Efforts to boost marginsGroupon is currently engaged in efforts to boost its margins from the North American business in particular. The company has taken a more streamlined targeted approach towards driving profitability and is focusing on improving margin growth in its strongest segment, which will flow to all other segments of the company and drive growth. Groupon has shifted additional business to drop-ship in order to improve the utilization of its own distribution center and increase the number of units per order, thereby driving down unit costs.The company is focusing on unit expansion of its orders and aims to offer more multi-product deals in order to keep product cycles in flow and drive order quantities upwards. Encouragement of bulk purchases would enable Groupon to further drive down unit costs. The company's efforts kept margins above 9% in the final quarter of FY 2014 and will drive margin growth and share price growth in the years to come as well.Potential Downsides for GrouponEmergence of competitionGroupon is threatened with the emergence of competition in the domestic market as well as the international market. The company's business model is easily replicable and is also easy to implement. The company's North American as well as international businesses will suffer as a result, and there could be hindrances to growth. However, Groupon's move from a push to a pull model and the use of non-email channels of advertising and targeted marketing will allow it to gain further identification with consumers and drive the company's revenues further despite the emergence of competition.ConclusionLooking ahead, Groupon has considerable growth prospects in store, as it is engaged in fruitful efforts to boost margins while market trends are favoring its key North American segment. The company is expected to continue to witness subscriber growth and eventually become profitable. There are definite upsides in store for Groupon. The road to profitability is definitely not easy for the company, but strong financial performance over the course of FY 2014 indicates that the company is definitely headed in the right direction. Groupon is definitely a worthwhile investment prospect for long-term investors."

Sure, there are plenty of anecdotes where deal expectations have fallen short. There's also a saying for that,For the past several years, online daily deal service specialist has brokered millions of deals between consumers and businesses. Still, questions remain about Groupon's business model and long-term viability. More importantly, when is Groupon stock going to deliver the value it once promised?With shares down more than 17% on the year to date, trailing the broader averages by a wide margin, is Groupon stock now a good deal? That's what investors want to know. And I don't believe Groupon, whose shares are down 30% in three years, answered that question Tuesday when it reported first quarter earnings results.Rising costs and competitive pressures on advertising remain headwinds for the company. And while Groupon has improved by going to a direct sales model, particularly from the standpoint of its billings metric, the company's prospects to make money remains unclear. So before placing a bet here on a Groupon recovery, grab a Snickers bar - these shares are not going anywhere for a while.For the quarter that ended March, Groupon reported a loss of $14.3 million, or 2 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to 3 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts were looking for 2 cents per share, on average. However, first quarter revenue came to $750.4 million, missing Street estimates by some $62 million.Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsky said in a statement,In fairness, the double-digit billings improvement has been encouraging for Groupon. And that number has remained steady for the past several quarters. The question, though, when will these improvements hit the bottom line? During the quarter, gross margin declined 390 basis points year over year to 46.3% of revenue.In that vein, as long as expenses continue to increase, gross billings - regardless of their improvement - won't reach the bottom line. For the current quarter ending in June, Groupon expects revenue in the range of $700 million to $750 million, below expectations of $799 million. Its per-share earnings will range from 1 cent to 3 cents, in line with consensus estimates.Groupon is building for the future. And that's what investors must realize. The company is investing in a new platform that allows merchants to offer their own deals. And its initiatives in terms of mobile is certain to have incremental benefits in the future.Still, there are no guarantees that any of these actions will deliver the growth investors expect. Nor do this quarter's results imply there are any improvements worth celebrating - at least not yet. Groupon continues to operate only in markets that its merchants create. It can't create its own. And that's part of the challenge.With its shares having traded flat for the past year, Groupon needs to demonstrate better signs of life to make this stock work. Even with shares down 17% in 2015, investors are still paying 30 times next year's estimates of 23 cents per share for Groupon stock. In my opinion, that's not a good deal, when you can own the S&P 500 for half the valuation."

Unfortunately, this stock is a perfect example of what can happen when a confluence of factors all within the company's control end up sinking the stock. Poor management, terrible metrics and low growth all push this stock to zero, in my opinion.PerformanceYou've watched the stock drop 47% on the year, with the Q2 earnings report only pushing it down further.

FinanceInternational Growth WoesVia the 8-K:While I've seen other users on this site praise the current valuation, the fact of the matter is that the company just doesn't have the growth prospects - the basic, fundamental building blocks that are supposed to project a stock forward. International growth is clearly a major problem and, to add to their list of troubles, ""This guidance anticipates nearly 600 basis points of unfavorable impact on the year-over-year growth rate from changes in foreign exchange rates."" With 0 hedges in place, they dedicated an entire spread on their 8-K to show what growth would've looked like in a more cooperative environment. This is in relation to both Q3 and full year revenue guidance. For all operations:ManagementManagement is the bane of this company's existence. Stating on the 8-K that this company is ""continuing to gain steam"" is the biggest lie to shareholders that I've witnessed. With 4.38 million shares sold in twenty separate transactions by management in the last six months, in relation to only one transaction purchasing shares in the quantity of 16,000, it's clear that the top level isn't confident in the company. If they aren't confident, how can I even think about being long in the stock? Not even that, but for institutional shareholders, a sell-off of 25.71% of their holdings has occurred since last quarter. It's not like this information isn't public knowledge - it's available on Yahoo! Finance for the simplest of investors. I'm not about to bet against a sell-off of 101 million shares from institutions and 4.38 million from insiders.Efficiencies - The Only PositiveWe've seen this company improve its bottom line by decreasing operating expenses 5% YOYThe company is hoarding $1.1 billion in cash and has no plans to do anything with it, except use it as a failsafe against Chapter 11. Sure, the company has authorized another $339 million for shares to be bought back, but the previous $122 million buyback at $6.43 a share only sent the stock down further.The Business ModelDid Groupon necessarily go wrong at one point in their public life? I'd argue no. It's much more the fact that consumers can go to so many other places to get great discounts on activities or products. For starters, Eventbrite, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Jet, and even Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is starting to have an expanding online and mobile platform. With this company's unique value component waning quickly, I see no reason to keep it in my portfolio. At best, on the Q3 earnings report, they'll have a decreased guidance and $0.00 EPS - that's the best case scenario. I have to tell you, I feel like I'm back in high school where other people can't see how bad things really are."
2934986,69965,2015-02-20T09:03:56-05:00,"If investors are looking for growth, look no further than Groupon.Groupon gives you cash flow growth in spades too.The ""Rest of the World"" is a big place, and Groupon's future is there.","Holding Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares has been frustrating for investors in the last year. The stock has essentially run a race to nowhere in the last 12 months. Though the company was originally blasted as a deals site that could be easily copied, today's Groupon is more about selling items than services. This change puts the company squarely in competition with such Internet titans as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Shockingly, there are three reasons Groupon might actually be a better bet than these two as a long-term play.Are these companies really competitors?Before we get to any comparison of Groupon and its peers, it's important to establish if these companies are truly competitors. If we look at revenue, or where these companies are developmentally, it's difficult to imagine Groupon being on the same plane as Amazon or eBay.However, the consumer doesn't see the size of a company or its financials when they are looking for a good deal. Millions of consumers (almost 54 million to be exact) are active users of Groupon. These users don't care if Amazon generated nearly 30 times the sales, or that eBay generated over twice the revenue of Groupon last quarter. Instead, they just want to know who has the best deal on the item they are looking for.One of the things that Amazon and eBay have taught customers is, they can quickly search online to find the best deal. Ironically, Amazon and eBay have been copying Groupon in trying to get users to sign up for emails detailing the best current deal.While Amazon is branching out constantly into additional services, 46% of the company's total sales were generated by its North American Electronics & General Merchandise business. Where eBay is concerned, PayPal may be the belle of the ball, but the Marketplaces division makes up nearly 47% of the company's total sales.Groupon on the other hand, generates about 57% of its total revenue from its Goods business. In plain English, each company generates around half of its revenue from selling physical items. When a consumer shops for a set of headphones, or a laptop, or a watch, they can just as easily search and buy on Groupon Goods as they can Amazon or eBay.Growth is the name of the game right?Investors and analysts have frequently focused on Amazon's revenue growth as a reason to buy the stock. Shareholders of eBay focus on the company's PayPal unit's growth as a great reason to own the shares. Those same investors should take a hard look at Groupon if they want to see growth worth owning.This is the first reason Groupon could make you green; the company is growing faster by multiple measures compared to its peers. The company's annual revenue growth in the last quarter came in at 25% excluding currency, compared to 18% growth at Amazon and just 9% at eBay.If we look at the core growth behind each of these companies, Groupon's growth profile looks better than either of its larger peers. Looking at billings growth, the company posted a 36% increase. Amazon's core business is its North American Electronics & General Merchandise business, which posted a 27% increase in the last quarter. If we look at eBay's enabled commerce growth of 21%, even by this measure it can't keep up with Groupon.The one thing investors need to watch in Groupon's revenue growth is the company's balancing act between its Deals and Goods business. While the company's Goods business has taken over as the growth driver, its Goods margins are paper thin.At this point, Groupon's overall operating margin matches that of Amazon at 2%. eBay's operating margin is less instructive because the company doesn't sell goods directly, instead it provides its marketplace to connect buyers and sellers.As we've seen, Groupon generates significantly less revenue than its two larger peers. Given that, the company's keeping up with Amazon's operating margin at a much earlier stage of development is impressive. In addition, whether we compare revenue growth or core growth, Groupon's top-line is simply growing faster than a few of its peers.Top line growth is important, but cash is more importantThe second reason Groupon could make you green is, the company is growing its core operating cash flow at a much faster rate than its peers. In the past, cash flow was a more reliable measure of the value that a company could return to shareholders. Though in the short term, companies may need to invest their cash flow for future growth, at some point the company must turn cash flow positive.One way for investors to compare fast growing companies is by looking at their cash flow. However, even the cash flow statement isn't immune from adjustments. The best way to get an apples-to-apples comparison is by looking at just the combination of net income and depreciation for each company.Groupon's core operating cash flow increased by more than 160% on an annual basis in the company's last earnings report. This performance was lights-out compared to Amazon's 33% increase or eBay's 7% growth by the same measure. This type of growth could be more important to investors than even Groupon's top-line performance.Generally speaking, when you find a company that is outperforming its peers in both top and bottom line growth, the stock is a buy.The future of GrouponThe third reason to buy Groupon is, the company's growth outside of its core North America and EMEA divisions is huge and the company's performance should only get better. Amazon and eBay already have significant international operations. While both of these titans have struggled recently overseas, Groupon is growing like a weed.eBay's Marketplaces division posted just a 2% increase in gross merchandise volume and more than 60% of this from overseas. Amazon's International Electronics & General Merchandise division only posted revenue growth of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis.By comparison, Groupon's Rest of World division posted 50% revenue growth excluding currency adjustments. Just as important, Groupon could more than double its Rest of World revenue just by achieving a revenue per billing that matches its more established divisions.If there is anything investors should be cautious of, it is the fact that Groupon's Rest of World operations are still in their infancy. The company's revenue overseas is growing much faster than its domestic operations, but this division is still posting losses.The challenge for Groupon, will be attempting to gain scale against competition that is more established. Though Groupon has been effectively growing domestically and in the EMEA geographies, there is no guarantee that this will occur in places like China, Japan, and other areas.That being said, as we've seen, Groupon's top-line growth, bottom-line growth, and fastest growing segment are all outperforming its two largest competitors. With the doubters still out in force on Groupon's stock, now could be a good opportunity to pick up shares for long-term growth investors."
3035966,69675,2015-03-30T05:06:54-04:00,"In recent years, sales have soared at Groupon but, due to the company's inability to earn a profit, shares have remained stagnant.
        The main contributor to this problem has been the company's emphasis on its Goods segment, which generates historically lower margins than its shrinking Local segment.
        While this isn't necessarily a bad goal, investors would be better served if management places a stronger emphasis on a smaller but very profitable piece of the overall pie.","Times have been tough for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). As the company's Local operations have been on the decline over the past few years and as its lower-margin Goods category has been seeing revenue climb, the company has yet to reward investors with a profit. This continuous net loss position the business appears to be stuck in has left investors feeling disenfranchised and has resulted in a tremendous loss of market value recently. Certainly, these concerns are valid but is it possible that, instead of emphasizing the growth of its Goods category, the company should be placing more growth on a little piece of its business that investors tend to gloss over?A small piece could become something moreDuring 2014, Groupon reported revenue of $3.19 billion, up 37% over the $2.33 billion reported just two years prior. Even as its sales in its Goods category have soared 130% from $772.96 million to $1.78 billion, the company's Local operations dropped a disappointing 12% from $1.40 billion to $1.23 billion. Meanwhile, the company's Travel operations, referred to as Groupon Getaways, a joint-venture (though one that is no longer being co-branded) between it and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), saw sales rise a modest 11% from $160.24 million to $177.60 million.It's this part of Groupon, however, that management should be placing a great deal of emphasis on. Between Expedia, Priceline Group (PCLN) and Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW), a company that has agreed to be purchased by Expedia, revenue in the online travel market has shot up an aggregate of 50% over the same three-year period with Priceline leading the way. In addition to being a fast-growing market, it's one that Groupon somehow manages to perform in quite well. During the past three years, the business has seen its gross profit margin in this space average 84.1% (they don't provide any data lower on the income statement than gross profit unfortunately).Source: Respective Companies' Financial StatementsThis is, believe it or not, higher than the industry leaders whose sales have been soaring. Expedia, for instance, has seen its gross profit margin rise year-over-year from 77.7% of sales in 2012 to 79.5% in 2014 for a three-year average margin of 78.5%. Orbitz Worldwide's average has been even higher with a gross profit margin ranging between 80.7% and 81.8% for a three-year average of 81.2%.Even Priceline can't seem to beat out Groupon's Travel category consistently. Over the past three years, Priceline's gross profit margin has risen from 77.6% to 89.8% and, today, is higher than Priceline's 2014 gross profit margin of 84.2%, but has still only averaged 83.9% over the past three years. Taking this data in the table above, it's not hard to see that Priceline will likely continue improving, but its results aren't significantly higher than Groupon's, which means that there could be the opportunity for Groupon to either sell its Groupon Getaways to a rival like Expedia or to spin it off into a separate entity that can try and grow it faster before the opportunity to get a strong hold in the online travel market vanishes forever.TakeawayOn the other hand, there's an even better opportunity that Groupon can consider from here. Instead of just casually growing this part of their business while emphasizing lower-margin areas like its Goods category and instead of either selling or divesting of its Travel category, the company could prioritize its growth moving forward. By taking up this kind of initiative, the business does risk failing but, given its strong margins in the space, this kind of risk sure beats settling for annual net losses with no apparent end in sight."

In addition to Xiaomi, Dianping is also backed by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), which incorporates Dianping in its WeChat messenger platform so a user can conveniently look up and share a restaurant or a point of interest with friends. The latest deal comes after rival Meituan, which is backed by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), raised $700m from a group of investors. I see this to be a positive for both BABA and Tencent. I see this to be a positive to Tencent as Dianping could use the additional capital to expand its footprint to offer users more relevant points of interest. This also bodes well for Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) in that when both business models are combined, there is significant strategic value for the larger internet companies that are looking to reinforce its ecosystem. I reiterate my bullish view on Tencent, BABA, YELP and GRPN on the back of this news.YELP + GRPN = Strategic ValueFor those who are not familiar with Dianping, it is modeled after YELP and GRPN in that a user can look up reviews on various points of interest and purchase a group-buy discount from the site. Dianping is the perfect example of a proven O2O business model and its recent financing suggests that the O2O market will continue to see robust growth driven by higher mobile usage and that those players that have scale and brand equity will likely to come out to be the winner. Clearly, Dianping has proven this point.The recent growth of O2O sites in China raises several possibilities including YELP moving into group-buy to enhance the stickiness of its platform. While it could face short-term losses, long-term implication is attractive as seen by the growth of Dianping, which has over 190m active users and covers over 12m businesses. By moving into group-buy, YELP can further solidify its positioning as the go-to site for local user review and O2O transactions.An alternative possibility is a potential partnership or merger between YELP and GRPN, in which the partnership could have a virtual monopoly over the O2O space here in North America. This partnership could have strategic value to large internet companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that are looking to strengthen its mobile ecosystem.Most likely, I believe Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be interested in acquiring YELP or GRPN given that it has been mimicking Tencent's strategy of building its mobile messenger platform. FB would deliver significant convenience to users should it decide to incorporate YELP and GRPN features into the messenger, as both have natural synergy with FB payment inside the messenger."

To accomplish these goals, the company aims to significantly expand its merchant network and move toward non-email based marketing strategies to increase its traction among customers globally. We believe more-than-anticipated success in these strategies could hold huge upside for the company’s stock, assuming the market prices in these plausible developments correctly. In addition, Groupon is also taking aggressive measures to enhance its goods margins in North America. We believe developments in this regard could lead to certain events that could trigger stock price changes for better or worse. So we assess three specific scenarios below: 1) an increase in the active merchant count to 1.3 million; 2) an increase in monthly unique visitors to 450 million; and, 3) goods margins remain unchanged.Active Merchant Count Rises To 1.3 Million (+30%): Groupon is taking various measures to expand its merchant network and inventory, considering it has been able to tie up with only around 2% of the target market of merchants (in core categories) presently. Since over 800,000 merchants have been featured on Groupon from its inception up to September 2014, we estimate the entire merchant opportunity at over 40 million. It has introduced new features, including Pages and G.Nome to help in this direction. More than 800,000 pages were launched last year; these provide useful information (including contact information, maps and reviews) and also allow customers to follow merchants, request deals and make appointments. Moreover, seven million more such pages are expected to be released soon in the coming months. The G.Nome operating system provides various features such as item-level sales, analytics and seamless redemption for customers, and connects merchants in real-time to Groupon’s systems. The company has also lowered its take rate for larger merchants to bolster deal quality on its marketplace.To roughly estimate the impact of merchant expansion on gross billings, we note that Groupon achieved overall gross billings of $7.58 billion in 2014 on the back of around 300k active merchants during the year. This implies average gross billings per active merchant stood at around $25k during 2014. If we forecast the long-term average gross billings per active merchant at around $16.5k (considering the possibility of newer merchants being not as active on the platform, coupled with international growth, where transaction values are lower), we estimate active merchant count to triple to around 900k in our $8.01 price estimate, on account of the above given initiatives. However, in the event, Groupon is able to expand its active merchant network significantly to over 1.3 million active merchants by the end of our review period, then it would lead to over 30% upside in our price estimate. We believe this could be a plausible scenario, owing to factors including: 1) rapid growth in subscribers on Groupon’s platform making it highly attractive for merchants, 2) a more than anticipated reduction in take rates due to increase in competition, and 3) the introduction of innovative deal categories that allow merchants to sell unused inventory.Monthly Unique Visitors Increases To 450 Million (+20%): Though Groupon began with a push-only strategy, which entailed sending hundreds of millions of emails daily to customers, the company has been making efforts to expand into non-email channels over the past few years. This strategy has showed some success, as the share of emails in North America’s local business reduced from 48% in Q4 2011 to 22% in Q3 2014. At the same time, the contribution of non-email business has grown from 52% to 78%. The ‘Pull’ strategy, which encompasses active search for deals, has gained traction, as its share in North American transactions increased from 9% in Q3 2013 to 24% in Q3 2014.To approximate the potential upside/downside of this strategy, we note that Groupon saw around 150 million monthly unique visitors globally during 2014, on top of which, it recorded $7.58 billion in gross billings. This translates into average gross billings of about $47 per monthly unique visitor currently. We estimate this metric to fall to around $40 in the long-run, due to growth in international markets, where consumer spending power is lower. Owing to these estimates, we believe monthly unique visitors on Groupon could surpass 370 million by the end of our forecast horizon. However, if the number of monthly unique visitors outpaces our expectation and rises to 450 million by 2021, then it will lead to over 20% increase in the company’s value. There are reasonable grounds to consider this as a plausible scenario, such as: 1) a large rise in deals and goods inventory should bolster Groupon’s popularity and usage among users worldwide; 2) success with Pages strategy will directly translate into more users searching the site; and, 3) deals from larger (and more popular) merchants will improve the stickiness of the platform.Goods’ Margins Stay Constant In North America (-10%): Groupon’s lack of profitability has been a key area of concern for the company’s investors. Its GAAP operating margin has declined over the past few years from 4.2% in 2012 to 2.9% in 2013 and -0.5% in 2014. The increasing proportion of the goods’ business in the overall mix, coupled with its low margins has been one of the primary reasons for this drop. Gross profit as a percentage of gross billings stood at 10.2% in the goods business in 2014, as compared to 30.9% and 15.3% in local and travel businesses respectively. At the same time, the share of goods billings in the overall company’s gross billings has risen from 28% in 2012 to 41% in 2014.Groupon’s shipping and fulfillment costs historically have been double compared to other bigger e-commerce companies. As a result, the company is taking initiatives to improve goods’ gross margins (mainly in North America) by shifting additional business to drop-ship status, adding more fulfillment to its own distribution center, and increasing the number of units per order. In the long-term, Groupon aims at goods gross margin (as a % of gross billings) at about 15% in North America, as compared to around 10% presently.In our valuation model, we estimate the goods’ category will comprise about half of Groupon’s overall business in North America (in terms of gross billings) in the long-run. Further, we have forecast long-term gross margin in North America’s local, goods and travel category at about 32.5%, 15% and 17% respectively in our price estimate. Hence, these forecasts lead us to conclude that Groupon’s North America gross margin could come down from 42.4% in 2014 to around 34% in the long-run (due to the increasing share of goods’ in the overall mix). In the event, goods’ gross margin in North America stays similar to current levels over our forecast period, then the overall North America gross margin could decline to less than 30%, leading to about 10% decline in our price estimate. We think there is some likelihood of this scenario taking place, considering there is intense competition in the North American e-commerce market, which is only expected to become worse with the entry of brick-and- mortar retail giants. This will play out in terms of price-based competition, and could result in reduction in shipping charges.Our $8.01 price estimate for Groupon’s stock is approximately 5% above the current market price.Disclosure: None"

However, Q1 guidance was slightly soft with revenue $790m-840m, which is below consensus expectation of $855m. EPS was also on the low-end of the consensus. ($0-$0.02 vs. consensus $0.02). Looking at just FY2015, EBITDA growth is expected to be around +25% y/y, which puts the company on track to meet the guidance it set on its analyst day in November.Overall, I believe that GRPN delivered a solid 2014 in that the results suggested that the core business is making a steady turnaround. Although still in its early stages, the trend is encouraging, and I believe that the company has a chance at creating a robust real-time mobile market place for local deals. My conviction arises once again from my observation of the group-buy market in overseas market such as Latin America, Europe and Asia where domestic group-buy platforms are increasingly adding relevant merchants (ie, popular restaurants, movie theaters, health/fitness, café/bakery) to the deal list rather than those from low-quality merchants. This will make the platform more sticky and keep the users engaged, which will result in recurring traffic to the platform. I remain bullish on GRPN. As we look back to the evolution of group-buy websites, those that have scale and brands have prevailed and GRPN stands out to be one of the survivors.ImplicationsNorth America trend improving. North America local billing accelerated from Q3, +14% (vs. +10% in Q3), another indication that the turnaround is on track and that the platform is becoming increasingly sticky to users who are proactively looking up deals via a ""pull"" strategy rather than the prior ""push"" (email alerts) strategy. Although billing is accelerating, take-rate has been declining to the lowest level in the past seven quarters. Contrary to management's guidance of a stable take-rate, I expect take-rates to trend lower for two more quarters or so as GRPN draws high quality merchants to the platform. Finally, gross margins increased 160bps y/y to 9.5% vs. a sequential decline in the prior quarters. I expect GM to trend higher once scale improves on the market place.Pulling the users in one by one. Active deals increased +23% y/y to 370k with half of them in North America. Scale is certainly improving and additional merchants signing onto the GRPN platform will result in more organic user traffic onto the platform. As I mentioned earlier, the trend is encouraging and the transition from the prior push to the current pull model seems to be on track.ConclusionI remain overweight on GRPN. While I agree that the stock has been a disappointment for some investors given its volatility and 1-year performance (-20%), it is important to understand that no other group-buy site has the scale that is comparable to GRPN. Continued turnaround will be an ongoing catalyst for the stock. Buy on weakness."

The results were lauded by market participants and led to more than a 10% increase in its stock price. The company expects its top-line to rise 15% during 2015 even though revenue growth is guided to just 4% to 11% during the first quarter of 2015. In addition, its long-term outlook is even more optimistic with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth targets set at over 20% and 25% by 2017. In this article, we analyze the key factors that are expected to fuel the company's earnings during the year, along with our take on whether its targets are achievable.We think Groupon's growth will be led by mobile-related transactions in the future, fueled by a rising share of mobile commerce in the overall business and this will also positively impact average spend per customer. At the same time, ongoing traction with its Pull strategy and stabilization in the email-related business will further propel demand going forward. Groupon posted robust growth across geographies and categories in the recent quarter, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. Over the long-run, we think Groupon's strategy to introduce Pages and G.Nome, and to lower take rates for higher-quality merchants, will lead to expansion in both the quantity and quality of deals on its marketplace, and this will help bolster customer adoption even further. However, we think revenue growth (in dollar terms) could slightly underperform against the 15% target in 2015, mainly due to currency headwinds and lapping of certain acquisitions. Moreover, in the event the Ticket Monster business gets sold off, then it will have an impact on year-over-year growth rates. Groupon Targets Over 15% Revenue Rise In 2015Groupon targets revenue growth at more than 15% in 2015 and, over the long-run, it aims to achieve a 20% plus increase in sales on top of a similar rise in annual gross billings by 2017. The key drivers that are expected to propel the company's growth in the future include:Rising Mobile Traction: Groupon is aggressively investing on mobile platform development as mobile commerce is rapidly gaining prominence in the overall online commerce market, fueled by rising Internet usage on mobile devices. The mobile platform currently accounts for over half of its business globally and in certain markets this figure is higher at around 65%. Groupon's cumulative app downloads crossed 110 million recently and we think this positions it well for growth. This is because mobile customers tend to buy more heavily as compared to web users, which pushes up average spend per active customer. This is because the annual gross billings of Groupon's mobile customers are over $70 higher than customers who transact only on the web (according to Groupon's filings). We expect Groupon's mobile customers to rise at a rapid pace in the coming years, considering its mobile penetration is still low and can improve further.Move From Push To Pull Model: While Groupon started with a push-only model, wherein it sent hundreds of millions of emails everyday to users, it has been making efforts to broaden into non-email channels over the last few years. This strategy has met with some traction, since the share of emails in North America local business has come down from 48% in Q4 2011 to 22% in Q3 2014. At the same time, the share of non-email business has risen from 52% to 78%. The ""Pull"" strategy has met with some success since active search for deals comprised for 24% of North American transactions at the end of Q3 2014, as compared to 9% at the end of Q3 2013. We expect the Pull marketplace to fuel the company's business going forward, considering that the email strategy by itself is unsustainable in the long-run. In an encouraging sign, while the email business suffered more than a 20% CAGR drop over the last the three years, its rate of decline subsided over the past year. We think this could help propel sales increase even further in the coming future.Expansion In Merchants And Inventory: We expect Groupon's strategy to roll out new features, including Pages and G.Nome, to help in merchant expansion in the coming years. Over 800,000 pages were released publicly in 2014 that carry valuable merchant-related information (such as contact information, maps and reviews) and allow users to follow merchants as well as to request deals and make appointments. In addition, seven million such pages have been built and will be released in the coming quarters for search engines to index. Alongside, the G.Nome operating system, which provides merchants with useful item-level sales and connects them to Groupon's platform in real-time, is being rolled out across merchants. Around 10,000 merchants have signed up for this service and we expect more merchants to adopt this system. The company's addressable market for merchants is immense, since presently less than 5% of the target market of merchants is tied with Groupon. We believe as these features gain popularity, a larger proportion of merchants would put deals on Groupon, which will make the platform even more attractive to consumers.While the average take rates for Groupon in its local business range from 35% to 45% (for smaller businesses), Groupon has reduced its take rates significantly to even as less as 0-5% for some national merchants. This initiative is expected to keep take rates in the North American local business at the lower end of 35-38% guidance range, over the coming quarters, in our view. We believe this strategy is essential considering holding inventory from national merchants would fast-track customer adoption for Groupon. While the number of active deals was seen to be 370,000 globally at the end of 2014, we believe this strategy will lead to significant expansion in this count, further driving the Pull strategy.Broad-Based Growth Expected Across Markets And Categories: We expect future growth to be robust across geographies in the coming years. Gross billings increased by 20%, 8% and 154%, respectively (excluding currency impact), in North America, EMEA and rest of world during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect future growth to be led by Asian markets, followed by South America, and developed markets of North America and Europe.In addition, we expect all categories (local, goods and getaways) to see strong demand in the future as well. The recent acceleration in North American locals business (which improved from 1-2% during the first two quarters of 2014, to 10% in Q3 and 14% in Q4) could continue going forward, in our view, as the major headwinds related to the email decline and redemptions have subsided over the past year.Our Take On Whether The Top-Line Target Is Achievable: While the top-line target looks largely achievable for 2015 given the high demand being seen across markets, there are a few areas we think could impact growth rates during this period.Our $8.01 price estimate for Groupon's stock, is broadly in line with the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
2898096,74855,2015-02-09T08:39:57-05:00,"Groupon set to release Q4FY14 results with some analysts expecting a 15% surge in revenues and 25% rise in EBITDA.North American Region is likely to prove pivotal in bringing in a substantial rise.

The company has stacked up a net loss of $81.878 million in losses in the first nine months of the fiscal year as compared to a loss of $14.146 million recorded in the same period last year. However, there are analysts who foresee a change in fortune for the company especially with regards to its North American and Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) regions.Starting off with the North American region, which contributes more than 50% to Groupon's revenues, we expect to see a surge in the coming quarter results. According to analysts from Sterne Agee and Evercore Partners Inc. (both of whom have upgraded Groupon stock), their analysis indicates that activity in the region, including other areas, have sped up. Analysts at the two firms expect a 15% in revenues with a 25% rise in EBITDA, which would see the Chicago based company record around $900 million in revenues and $90 million in EBITDA. The contribution from the North American region should continue to improve throughout the year as economists are also optimistic of the US's recovery and hope to see the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates in the coming months. Consumer confidence in the US is on the rise as more jobs were created in the region. January 2015 was the 11th consecutive month where the economy added more than 200,000 jobs. As a large portion of travel expenditure by consumers is based on vacations, the fact that the economy is recovering is a good sign for companies like Groupon who in turn will benefit from an increase in revenues. However, there are some economists who advise caution when it comes to the Fed raising rates, such as BBC's Andrew Walker who points out that after 6 years of keeping interest rates near zero the central bank will very slowly raise it to normal levels, which ultimately might take a substantial amount of time. On the flipside, there are those who point out that the sudden pace in the jobs market, which has added 3.2 million new jobs in the past year, will force the Federal Reserve to revise rates as consumer spending will once again inevitably increase.It is the company's Rest of the World segment that seems to be piling up significant losses. Despite gross billings and revenues raising in the previous quarter y-o-y, the company recorded increased operating losses in the segment as losses widened by nearly $5 million in the segment. The company expected to see significant gains from the region and even sought to find partners to help them expand in Asia. The company hoped to expand shareholder value by using its Ticket Monster, which it acquired for $260 million earlier in 2014. However, the Chicago based company is reportedly in talks to sell South Korea's second largest mobile commerce company for an estimated $1 billion. The sale of the division could bring in some much needed cash as well as relief in the stock market where investors will be forced to reevaluate the company's value. Even though most details about the deal remain uncertain there are reportedly a number of private-equity names interested including KKR & Co. and the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) offshoot CJ Group. According to the Wall Street Journal, sources privy to the details expect a deal to materialize by the end of March.Over the past 52-weeks Groupon stock has deteriorated by more than 30% as Wall Street remains bearish towards the stock. There is a decent chance that the company could record improving results in the coming quarter. If sales do cross $900 million mark for the quarter we can expect to see and EPS of $0.03, a fairly different scenario from the first quarter results of the year when the company recorded a -$0.03 EPS. In the coming year the company could very well see itself rebound riding on the American economy, although it might face some difficulties if it fails to spin off Ticket Monster. Investors would be wise to keep an eye on any substantial news regarding the sale of Ticket Monster."
2773365,39301,2014-12-23T14:17:21-05:00,"Groupon continues to move higher on the back of improving investor sentiment.This is driven by accelerating billings growth in its local deal business, along with growth in new areas such as travel and goods.Hedge fund managers are expressing more interest in Groupon.The CFO’s projections on revenue and AEBITDA look extremely promising.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) continues to buck the trend as the stock has moved higher since the middle of the year. Initially Groupon's valuation deflated due to investors lacking confidence in the company's mobile strategy. Needless to say, the company proved the doubters wrong by growing mobile users and attracting vendors to the company's platform.Going forward, the growth prospects of the company are encouraging as the company has shifted its business model to be accommodative of physical products, travel and services. Through Groupon, users can purchase local deals, vacation packages and physical goods. In other words, it's more of a direct competitor to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but with a significantly better profit and loss structure.Source: GrouponGroupon has reversed the decline in its local deal business as patterns of growth are starting to emerge. While the goods business is seeing some deceleration, it's still growing at a fairly respectable 25% growth rate, whereas the travel business sees fluctuation in its growth, but is still growing at a 30% - 40% CAGR.The group discounting model has been attracting more and more budget conscious mobile users. Groupon's efforts to create a more functional mobile app through vendor specific pages, point of sale terminals and location-based features is driving the business into a resurgent growth opportunity. Admittedly revenue recognition tends to trail billings growth, as the company doesn't actually recognize revenue until Groupon is redeemed with vendors. So the graphic on billings growth may not necessarily be reflected on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis until a couple more quarters go by.Quoted from ValueWalk:The company seems relatively undervalued, and with guidance set at 15% revenue growth for FY 2015, and 25% adjusted EBITDA CAGR until FY 2017, the stock may exhibit quite a bit of growth over the next couple years.Going forward, Groupon may be the better play on e-commerce as the growth prospects look more compelling when compared to Amazon and eBay. While Groupon isn't exactly cheap, the company's profitability will improve drastically based on adjusted EBITDA projections.Unlike Amazon, Groupon will look to improve profitability in a more acceptable timeframe - perhaps making it a better play on e-commerce."
2790795,78265,2015-01-01T12:46:43-05:00,"Groupon is an amazing company in many ways, having achieved enormous growth and global reach.This doesn't mean you want to buy shares in it. It's expensive and it makes terrible returns.The future, especially with mobile ecommerce, can be quite bright... but we should wait and see before pouncing.","We really like the Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) service. We use it pretty religiously, and have had nothing but positive experiences with it. If investing was as simple as buying that which you like, we'd back up the truck on Groupon, throw out the 10-Ks, head to the beach... and maybe read 10-Ks on the beach.Some BackgroundGroupon operates across three major categories: Groupon Local, Groupon Goods and Groupon Getaways. Some background:In a very short time, Groupon has achieved enormous reach, operating in 47 countries, which themselves represent about 80% of global GDP. In addition, the company has achieved a vast network of 250 million subscribers and more than 800,000 merchants. It hosts more than 150 million monthly unique visitors. One of the principal reasons for the company's success is that it offers a compelling value proposition for both consumers and merchants. Groupon offers merchants excellent new customer acquisition and campaign analysis. For customers, and we can testify to this ourselves, Groupon provides some amazing deals.In addition to their impressive reach and compelling value proposition, the future looks interesting as well - particularly with regard to mobile ecommerce. Groupon will be able to leverage its relationships to offer customers deals to which they are proximate. This leads us to believe that Groupon is poised to be one of the key players in e-commerce. In addition, the company enjoys a great deal of institutional investor support. Some of these institutional players include Leon Cooperman, Ray Dalio, Ruanne Cunniff and Jim Simons. At the moment, institutional ownership sits at about 72% of the outstanding shares.For those who've read our other articles, you may have wondered whether we're capable of getting excited about anything. The majority of our articles are bearish. If anything does light our fuse, Groupon comes close. Then we look at the numbers and it all goes so, so sour…Is Revenue Always Good?When we examine a company, one of the first things we like to do is compare its revenue and net income, historically. If the company's sales growth can be turned into profit growth, then all the better. The problem is that all too often, a company might boast higher revenue, yet delivers stubbornly weak profits. When we see growing revenue and weak profits, we have to ask: if growing sales won't make the company more profitable, what will? When we reviewed annual data for Groupon provided by Gurufocus from March of 2010 to September 2014, we see the following picture:Source: GurufocusWhat is interesting here is that, for Groupon, there's a very weak relationship between revenue and net income. In fact, according to our analysis of the figures provided by Gurufocus, the correlation between the two series is only .29. This suggests that revenue and net income are only tenuously connected. So if more revenue won't improve the net income at Groupon, what will? We wish we knew.Poor Returns And Executive Compensation Up While the Stock is DownAccording to Gurufocus, return on assets currently stands at -7.78% and return on equity is -21.40%. The stock is down about 30% over the past year, but executive compensation is up about 21% in that same time. Management teams who reward themselves with greater compensation while the stock underperforms the overall market by about 40% is something we consider to be a problem.Low Returns + Expensive Price: Never a Good ThingAccording to Gurufocus, Groupon has a TTM EV/EBIT of -238.58 . This implies an operating cash yield of about -.4%. At the moment, the value of the entire enterprise would be better invested in a basket of US Treasury Bills. (The capital would be much safer and the return would, in some sense, be infinitely greater - i.e., positive.)With Groupon, investors are buying a great idea at an unattractive price. It may work out, but then again, it may not work out. And given how expensive the stock is, at the moment, we'll continue to enjoy the sweet deals they offer, put the company on the watch list, and wait until we get some proof of improved profitability."
2770935,24663,2014-12-22T11:53:53-05:00,"GRPN, like NFLX and AAPL in the past, has suffered from a change in operating philosophy.However, NFLX and AAPL both weathered this storm nicely, resulting in higher stock prices after short-term collapses.Thankfully, there are many reasons to believe GRPN's margin troubles will soon end, which should have a NFLX and AAPL-like effect.","While Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares have stabilized in recent months, even seeing gains of 27% in the last six months, the stock remains 70% lower since its high profile IPO in 2011. Despite these losses, Groupon has remained a legitimate growth company with expected 23.4% revenue growth this year. However, when you look at what led to Groupon's stock to trade drastically lower, you can't help but notice the similarities to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) respective downturns, and the opportunity it could ultimately create.To explain this noted comparison, let's first look at Netflix. NFLX experienced an epic decline in 2011, which led its stock price to remain relatively low for roughly a year. While Carl Icahn is often credited with NFLX's recovery, it is quite clear the stock has essentially tracked the performance of its gross margin.Netflix shares collapsed once it split the DVD and streaming businesses and content costs begun to rise. While content costs remain high, and Netflix is nowhere near as profitable as it was in 2010, the company's revenue and subscriber growth has remained solid. After bottoming out, its gross profit has begun to rise. The stock chart says the rest.Next, let's look at Apple, which surprisingly shares a similar chart with Netflix.Apple's stock hit an all-time high in 2012, but as margins peaked, and fell soon after, so did Apple's stock. A lower mix of high-margin iPhone sales were considered the culprit for lower margins. However, like Netflix, Apple's margins have bottomed and begun to rise.The effect following Netflix and Apple's margin recovery was in both instances all-time high stock prices. While it's hard to know why, my theory is that investors sold in fear of a worst case scenario, not knowing how low margins could fall. When margins started to recover, and the underlying business itself was still strong, investors bought back with authority.That said, Groupon's gross margin has yet to bottom. In essence, its gross margin decline from 90% to 50% has been quite epic, but it is because of the growth in its e-commerce business.GRPN PRICE, GROSS MARGIN TTMDuring Groupon's last quarter, revenue in its e-commerce-driven business grew more than 60% year-over-year and now accounts for well over half of the company's total sales. The problem is that this particular segment has a gross margin of only 20%.Therefore, as this low-margin business continues its rapid growth and Groupon's daily deals segment (with a gross margin near 90%) sees sales fall at a mid-single digit clip, investors might think that Groupon's gross margin could have further to fall. However, that might not be the case.For one, Groupon's travel business is performing well. This segment operates similarly to Groupon's daily deals business, which includes vouchers for the company's purchasing customers, meaning there are no high fulfillment costs, unlike its e-commerce business. As a result, travel's gross margin is comparable to the company's daily deals segment - 85% during its last quarter.In addition, Groupon has made several moves in recent months that could also drive margins higher. This includes raising the minimum order price to $24.99 before Groupon is responsible for shipping in its e-commerce business. This eliminates Groupon's responsibility for shipping $20 goods.Groupon has also entered the sports and events booking space with its acquisition of Ticket Monster last year, which operates like Ticketmaster in Korea. Ticket Monster has been responsible for Groupon's 133% increase in Rest of World gross billings during the first six months of this year. Like travel and daily deals, the expenses for this segment are low.The company has launched a payments platform called Gnome, working both online and in the brick-and-mortar locations of its participating vendors. These vendors pay a fee for the service, thereby allowing customers to capitalize on deals off the site, which also has low costs for Groupon.Lastly, Groupon has moved into time-based deals, reservations and has consolidated its fulfillment operations. Collectively, all of these changes and new services present a good opportunity for Groupon to significantly increase its margins in the immediate future.All things considered, like Netflix and Apple, Groupon's stock was hit hard as its gross margin declined rapidly. In essence, the gross margin decline is nothing more than a reflection of Groupon's prioritizing of e-commerce, which in long-term is better for the company's growth prospects. Not to mention, prioritizing e-commerce also opens new doors to create high-margin services, such as those noted. Apple and Netflix made similar moves: Apple moved into China and grew the iPad into one of its best-selling product categories of all time. Meanwhile, Netflix's emphasis on content has earned it dozens of Emmy nominations and attracted millions of new customers, thereby leading to revenue growth.In other words, both Apple and Netflix are still great companies, they just look different than before the gross margin collapse. The same applies to Groupon: It is no longer a coupon company with minimum upside, but rather a fast-growing e-commerce business that is showing no signs of slowing down. For long-term investors, e-commerce is more promising and once gross margins begin to stabilize, which I anticipate to be sooner rather than later, Groupon's stock is likely to follow Netflix and Apple, trending to new all-time highs."
2782425,56262,2014-12-27T12:25:52-05:00,Upbeat quarterly results is a good sign.New acquisitions will drive growth.Expansion into e-commerce will prove to be beneficial in the long run.Groupon looks like a buy going into 2015.,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is improving as it is evident from its latest results. The company reported an upbeat third quarter as its gross billings increased 39% to $1.86 billion, while revenue increased 27% to $757 million. The adjusted EBITDA came in at $67 million, up from $40 million last quarter. This has set the stage for a better performance from Groupon going forward. Moreover, the company has lined up a number of moves in order to continue growing at a solid pace. In this article, we will take a closer look at why Groupon will keep getting better.How Groupon plans to growGroupon is witnessing robust growth in mobile transactions, as the company's app was downloaded by a massive 92 million users last quarter. The company is primarily focusing on boosting its local growth in North America and abroad. The company is also working on improving the gross margin and operating efficiency of the goods business, and the stability in its international operations. All in all, these initiatives will help Groupon to reduce losses and generate strong income, and reduce the impact of newer acquisitions.A decline in the average number of unused Groupons per customer has also been observed, which is a 25% decrease in the past year. This suggests how more and more people are getting interested in buying.The company has also realized that having less than 5% of the available merchants on its platform is not going to be beneficial. To cover the other 95%, Groupon has launched two new products, namely Pages and Gnome that help improve the local offerings. Pages provides useful information for its users that includes contact information, maps, time of service, recommendations, tips, and a variety of discounts by creating a web and mobile presence for every local merchant.Gnome is the new operating system for merchants whether they are running a deal or just looking to claim their merchant page. Gnome comes with the iPad Mini with a credit card swiper, and allows merchants to avail seamless redemption, thus enabling customers to redeem their Groupons without even using their phones. It also features a digital cash register that improves workflows, a point of sale system that captures item-level detail and full payment processing at competitive rates. Gnome, when provided to the 92 million people who have downloaded the company's app, will create a whole new level of flexible and diverse commerce. This will attract a greater number of merchants and users to the company's platform.Moreover, Groupon is expanding into e-commerce via acquisitions. The company recently completed the acquisition of U.S. based fashion site Ideeli and South Korean online marketplace Ticket Monster. The aim is to make the company a fully integrated online marketplace, rather than just a daily-deals site. The company is delivering robust performance with half of its business dependent on the mobile segment. The very aim of the company stands at delivering both gross billings and gross profit growth of at least 20% annually over the next five years.The RisksGroupon has witnessed significant increase in short interest recently. As of November 14th, there was short interest totaling 93,562,046 shares, a growth of 8.4% from the October 31st total of 86,292,428 shares. This implied that currently almost 21% of the company's shares are being sold short and this may keep a lid on its price. Also, a PEG ratio of over 5.77 indicates that shares are not as cheap as they were in the beginning of 2014.ConclusionDriven by new initiatives, there are reasons to believe that Groupon is a good investment in 2015. Although Groupon's short interest is high and the company still falls into the category of a daily deals company, but with its improving goods business, it is likely to transform into a commerce giant. As a result, investors should consider investing in Groupon from a long-term perspective since the company's prospects look bright."

However, Groupon has the strongest operating cash flow, nearly 4x GrubHub and Yelp.Both Groupon and GrubHub benefit from favorable merchant payment terms that allow these companies to fund growth from operating cash flows.Groupon is a risky short given its strong operating cash flow, high short position and $461 million remaining repurchase authorization that represents 16% of the company’s current market capitalization.","In full disclosure, I'm long ""Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)."". However, as an investor, I always find it helpful to consider the opposing viewpoint. One of the reasons I started contributing to Seeking Alpha was to get more feedback on my own investing ideas. With that said, I hope the analysis provided in this article will be useful to both longs and shorts alike and generate some interesting conversation in the comments section.In previous articles, I've outlined a few arguments for why Groupon is a strong long-term investment with significant capital appreciation potential. However, just because a company makes a good long-term investment doesn't mean it's a good value at current prices. In order to evaluate a company, one should examine its fundamental operating metrics. In this article, we'll compare Groupon's operating cash flow to that of other competitors in the local space, such as ""GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB)"" and ""Yelp (NYSE:YELP)."" While each of the three companies have slightly different business models (Yelp is the most different given its local advertising business model), I feel they make for a good comparison since they all operate in the local space and aim to connect local merchants with potential customers.Comparing Fundamentals of GRPN, GRUB and YELPBelow is a table of metrics for each of the three companies:Groupon is currently valued at $2.8 billion, with an Enterprise Value of $1.72 billion with a Price/Sales ratio of 0.88x. The company has over $1.1 billion in cash on their balance sheet with only $100~ million in long-term debt and liabilities. Management forecasts FY2015 EBITDA to come in at $290 million, which translates to a 5.86x EV/EBITDA ratio at current levels.Yelp is currently valued at $1.85 billion, with an Enterprise Value of $1.54 billion and Price/Sales ratio of 4.12x. The company has over $366 million in cash and zero long-term debt. Management expects FY2015 EBITDA of $78 million (top end of guidance), which translates to an 18.84x EV/EBITDA ratio at current levels.GrubHub is currently valued at $2.57 billion, with an Enterprise Value of $2.11 billion and a Price/Sales ratio of 8.15x. The company has over $313 million in cash and zero long-term debt. Management expects FY2015 EBITDA of $112 million (top end of guidance), which translates to 19.74x EV/EBITDA at current levels.As I looked over these figures, one of the first things I noticed was that GrubHub's Revenue/Employee metric is the highest of the three, slightly edging Groupon's. This isn't surprising given GrubHub's commission-based business model (similar to Groupon's Local and Priceline's Booking.com's models, studied in a previous article). I had expected Groupon to do better than GrubHub here since they have a larger revenue base. However, Groupon's employee count of nearly 12,000 means that the ratio falls behind GrubHub's. Yelp, on the other hand, is surprisingly poor at generating revenue per employee. Though in absolute dollars, Yelp generates approximately $150 million more per year than GrubHub (as of 2014), the company also has three times as many employees. I suspect that much of the weakness in revenues for both Groupon and Yelp is likely due to foreign operations, a theory that merits further investigation. GrubHub has the smallest international operations of all three companies, which is one explanation for their stronger revenues/employee ratio and overall profitability.Most Important Metric for Growth Companies: Operating Cash FlowIf we compare the three companies on P/E alone, GrubHub seems like the best investment overall, followed by Groupon and Yelp. However, since all three are considered ""growth stocks"" that rely primarily on non-GAAP metrics such as adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, using traditional profitability metrics like P/E ratio is not as helpful in evaluating the growth and profit potential of these companies. For companies that are burgeoning spaces such as O2O commerce, gaining market share through rapid growth is more important than short-term profitability. Examples of this emphasis on growth over profitability include companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). For the purposes of this article, I will focus my attention on a comparison of operating cash flow for the three companies. Operating cash flow is my preferred metric in this scenario because it most accurately reflects each company's ability to fund growth from existing operations.Of the three, Groupon has the strongest operating cash flow with $288,824,000 for 2014 and 365,621,000 TTM. GrubHub was second with $72,904,000 million for 2014 and $73,163,000 TTM. Yelp had the weakest 2014 operating cash flow with $57,932,000 and $81,608,000 TTM, which was slightly higher than GrubHub's.GRPN 5-Year Operating Cash Flow (Data provided by Morningstar.com)GRUB 5-Year Operating Cash Flow (Data provided by Morningstar.com)YELP 5-Year Operating Cash Flow (Data provided by Morningstar.com)Of all the three companies, Yelp had the strongest net income in 2014 at $36.47 million. By contrast, GrubHub had net income of $24.26 million and Groupon took a $63.92 million loss. While both Yelp and GrubHub were profitable in 2014 (with GrubHub the most consistently profitable), Groupon had the strongest cash flow position. Net income factors in depreciation (tangible assets) and amortization (intangible assets) in the operating expenses line item. While amortization and depreciation are necessary to calculate the fair value of a company's assets, they do not impact a company's day-to-day cash flow as they are non-cash items and do not represent liabilities that the company needs to pay off. For Groupon, adding depreciation and amortization back in to calculate the company's operating cash flow more than fully offsets the loss in 2014 (-63,919,000 loss vs. $144,921,000 in amortization and depreciation). The other line item that makes a significant difference in Groupon's operating cash flow is accrued liabilities, which were $98,924,000 in 2014. As Groupon's 2014 10-K explained, the accrued liabilities were ""primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers of merchandise and the seasonally high level of goods transactions in the fourth quarter of 2014."" GRPN 2014 10-KGroupon's Favorable Merchant Models: Redemption Payment and Fixed PaymentA quick look at Groupon's operating cash flow from 2010 to 2014 shows a consistent level of accrued liabilities, which is a result of Groupon's favorable cash flow cycle. Groupon typically takes payment upfront from customers while paying their suppliers and local merchants some time after. For those new to Groupon's business model, the company takes a percentage of revenue (commission) for each Groupon sold in its Local and Travel businesses. According to management, the current take rate for North America hovers around 32%-35%. Groupon is willing to reduce take rates in order to attract higher quality merchants (i.e. strong operations and existing customer base). Smaller merchants, such as those who use Deal Builder, typically split revenues 50/50 with Groupon. Groupon Goods, unlike Local and Travel, operates along the lines of a typical e-commerce company. For most of these transactions, Groupon is the merchant of record, which means they both acquire inventory and sell it, reaping the profits as well as costs of sale and delivery. Given the low margins and high cost of goods sold is typical of e-commerce operations, the key to Groupon's future profitability is in its local and travel businesses due to the higher margins and low operating expenses. Not only is the local business asset light, but it benefits from favorable merchant payment terms. For example, in EMEA and Rest of World, Groupon remits payment to merchants only after customer redemption under Groupon's Redemption Payment Model. Essentially, this means Groupon holds the cash paid from customers who purchased Groupons and only pays its merchants after the Groupon has been redeemed. From Groupon's 2014 10-K:In the majority of North America, Groupon pays merchants under their Fixed Payment Model. Under this model, third party merchants who have deals on an ongoing basis are paid every two weeks as Groupons are purchased. For direct revenue deals in which Groupon is the merchant of record (mostly Groupon Goods), payment terms range from 30-60 days. The delay between when Groupon receives payment and when it pays its merchants provides Groupon a short-term ""float"" that can be reinvested into growth opportunities.According to Groupon's 2014 10-K, EMEA and Rest of World made up approximately 43% of the company's nearly $3.2 billion in revenues. While EMEA and Rest of World growth is not as stable as Groupon's North American operations, management notes that these regions are a few years behind North America in terms of maturity. As EMEA and Rest of World revenue growth stabilizes, Groupon's favorable Redemption Payment Model will ensure strong operating cash flow from which they can fund and accelerate growth initiatives, such as Groupon to Go. Even in North America, Groupon benefits from the short-term float. This short-term float, used favorably by companies such as Amazon or Dell, allows Groupon to maintain strong cash flows to drive growth in their marketplace despite posting losses in their operating income. Many critics rightly question the sustainability of this model. However, I would argue that the size of the opportunity for Groupon Local and Groupon's dominant market share and scale in this space create significant runway for Groupon to grow both supply and inventory, as well as to drive demand to its site from the consumer side. This is an argument that I will outline and support with greater detail in future articles. For a fun little info-graphic on the extent to which off-line retail dwarfs the online market, check out this link. GrubHub also benefits from this short-term float as the company remits payments to restaurants on ""at least a monthly basis.""Since Yelp derives most of its revenue from local advertising, the company does not benefit from the same merchant payment dynamics as Groupon and GrubHub do. Ultimately Yelp's revenue growth depends on the company's ability to convince local merchants of the benefits of advertising on their platform. Despite having a sizable number of unique monthly visitors (averaging over 135 million in 2014), Yelp has been unable to effectively monetize this traffic, which helps to explain their weak revenue growth as of late. YELP 2014 10-KIn comparing GrubHub and Groupon, the argument can be made that Groupon is in a much stronger growth position given the company has nearly four times the operating cash flow of GrubHub ($289 million vs. $73 million in 2014). Effectively, this means that Groupon can outspend GrubHub and Yelp four to one in expanding their business. Yet according to market capitalization, Groupon is only valued slightly higher than GrubHub ($2.83 billion for Groupon versus $2.57 billion for GrubHub, a differential of approximately 10%). It is especially important to compare operating cash flows as they relate to growth potential since Groupon has recently launched their online ordering/delivery service, Groupon to Go, to directly compete with GrubHub and Yelp's Eat24. While GrubHub has a substantial lead in online ordering and delivery in North America, Groupon benefits from greater operating cash flow that can be invested in this new business and has a strong base of tens of thousands of existing restaurant relationships. Yelp also has a strong position in this space with Eat24, which should aid their revenue growth going forward.Strong Operating Cash Flow = Risky ShortWhile a proper analysis of why Groupon is a risky short deserves its own article or series of articles, I believe the key takeaways from this piece should give pause to those considering a short position in Groupon. With nearly $1.4 billion in current assets, which more than covers their $1 billion in current liabilities, a consistent cash flow averaging over $266 million annually since 2011, and an EV/EBITDA of 5.86x, less than a third of GrubHub and Yelp's, the short case for Groupon seems difficult to justify. Currently, Groupon is 50% off its 52-week high, has 16% of its float short and has a remaining $461 million under its existing repurchase authorization, which represents approximately 16% of the company's current market capitalization. Although the short thesis is not without merit, at these levels the risk/reward of a short position seems tenuous at best.While a healthy cash flow will ensure a company's ability to fund its growth initiatives, future profitability will depend also on control of operating expenses. Groupon lags behind GrubHub when it comes to revenue/employee and stock-based compensation/employee ratios, which demonstrate management's shortcomings in cost control. In order for Groupon to capitalize on its strong revenue growth, management will need to show greater discipline in reducing operating expenses. In my next article, I will take a deeper look at how effectively each of the three companies control operating expenses, including stock based compensation, SG&A and overall cost of revenue."
2920216,24663,2015-02-17T12:26:43-05:00,"GRPN's revenue growth, customer growth, billings and the likely asset sale of Ticket Monster all drove the stock higher after earnings.One overlooked concern is that GRPN's travel revenue grew just 15.7%.Given how quickly GRPN's travel revenue growth decelerated in a seemingly strong quarter for the industry, hopes of higher margins might be nothing more than a dream for 2015.","Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) fourth quarter was by all accounts pretty solid - revenue increased 20% and the company's active customers finished the year at nearly 54 million. However, one area of big concern is that travel revenue grew just 15.7% and accounted for only 4.5% of its total revenue. This is a business that showed signs in early 2014 of high growth, but its deceleration of growth minimizes the hope of Groupon seeing strong margin expansion in 2015 and beyond.GRPN Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsSince 2012 Groupon's stock has fallen more than 60%. However, as evident in the chart above, Groupon's stock woes are not a reflection of its revenue growth. Instead, its Groupon's declining margin that has created concern in the past. Notably, the fact that Groupon's 12-month free cash flow has declined moderately since 2012 versus its revenue growth illustrates just how far its margins have declined.That said, the reason for Groupon's margin decline is quite simple to understand. Its Local segment, coupons, carry a gross margin around 90% historically. This is a low-cost business where customers print vouchers to redeem their purchased product or service. Groupon then receives a percentage of that sale. The problem is that revenue in this segment consistently declines as customers gravitate toward Groupon's Goods business, which acts more so like e-commerce. In this business, Groupon is responsible for shipping purchased goods that are priced over $24.99. The additional fulfillment costs associated with the Goods business has kept the segment's gross margin closer to 20%, give or take a few basis points.As a result, with Local revenue dwindling and Goods revenue soaring, Groupon's profits have evaporated. Fortunately, Travel was seen as a potential hope, having revenue growth well in excess of 30% for the first nine months of 2014 and a gross margin similar to the company's Local business. However, the decelerated growth to just 15.7% in the fourth quarter is a bit, if not very concerning. With fourth quarter revenue of just $41.9 million Groupon's Travel segment is small enough to where significant top-line growth should be achieved consistently.The fact that Groupon's Travel revenue growth decelerated so significantly does suggest that consolidation within the online travel industry might be having a negative effect on Groupon's business. With Expedia and Priceline acquiring so aggressively, consumers can get their travel needs met along with great prices by using one of these larger services. While Groupon did not mention competitive reasons for its Travel struggles in Q4, I do find it rather obvious given TripAdvisor's strong fourth quarter performance and the equally impressive quarters from the likes of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) and Wyndham Worldwide (NYSE:WYN), thereby suggesting that the fourth quarter was very good for the travel industry as a whole.All things considered, Groupon's Travel concerns don't necessarily make the stock a sell, as investors finally seem to have looked past low gross margin performance in favor of revenue growth in the Goods business. However, it does insinuate that predictions and hopes of a recovering gross margin may not be likely for 2015. The primary reason is because Groupon's Goods business is significantly outperforming its other high-margin businesses, and while Travel once looked like a business that could spark the next wave of high margin growth for Groupon, it now does not."
2672165,39301,2014-11-12T23:51:00-05:00,"Groupon has reoriented its business model to be more mobile-centric.By making various changes to its mobile application, the company has been able to increase active deals and buyers.Over time, I expect revenue and margins to improve, which makes GRPN a compelling growth investment opportunity.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) continues to deliver on various financial objectives, as the company was able to surprise analyst estimates in its most recent quarter. However, developments beyond billings and active user growth are what intrigue me.In an earlier article, I suggested that Groupon would drive contextual notifications to its users:Well, in Tuesday's investor's day presentation, Groupon emphasizes location-specific features that will soon be released:Source: GrouponGoing forward, users will be able to buy Groupons based on what's nearby. They will also be able to search for deals that are within a certain distance from the user. This makes Groupon's application much more location-centric, which will work extremely well with smartphones and wearable devices.Also, Groupon has made practical additions to its user interface by creating instant buy-buttons (borrowed from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) instant checkout option) and mobile payment options like Apple Pay. This makes the Groupon buying experience significantly easier than it was before. By focusing more heavily on the app experience, Groupon believes it can drive further volume for its merchants, which will attract even more merchants and users over time.Groupon anticipates it will grow revenue by 15% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA by 20% year-over-year in 2015. However, by 2017, Groupon has a target of 20% annualized revenue growth and 20% annualized adjusted EBITDA growth.Source: YChartsOver the past five years, Groupon's revenue growth has steadily declined. In the process, Groupon has moved its business away from e-mail marketing and has developed the mobile-side of its business. Groupon believes a change in the sales mix had negatively impacted financial performance on the front-end, but on the back-end the impact from focusing more heavily on mobile will result in accelerated growth rates.Source: GrouponGroupon reported that gross billings from local deals have improved significantly between Q2 2014 and Q3 2014. This has come as a result of more active users on Groupon and an increase in the amount spent via mobile devices. Admittedly, over the same period e-mail marketing has declined, but the impact was offset through deals that were sold through the mobile app and other marketing efforts outside of e-mail marketing. Because Groupon has become more proficient with its marketing budget and operates at much better scale, gross margin across its business segments is expected to improve.Source: GrouponBecause the business is expected to drive revenue growth and better profitability, it offers a compelling growth trajectory. Groupon has exited a rough stretch that led investors to question how effective the company's model would be in face of competition and declining effectiveness of e-mail driven deals. By re-focusing the platform on mobile and identifying ways to drive efficiency in its cost structure, the business has been able to improve its adjusted EBITA margin and reignite revenue growth in non-performing segments.Furthermore, Groupon has been able to make strategic acquisitions, as Ticket Monster added meaningful growth in its international segment. Groupon reported reasonable uptake in its Gnome platform for merchants and has rolled out analytics to help justify various Groupon campaigns. Active deal figures and the number of active buyers have also trended higher.New business opportunities have been developed, such as travel and goods. These new categories grow at much higher rates despite having a lower take rate. The incremental impact from marketing travel packages and goods will be minimal in the interim, but I expect these categories will grow into a much larger percentage of the earnings and sales mix going forward.To conclude, I like Groupon's growth prospects. The business isn't very profitable on either a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. This makes it a tough sell for those who have very specific criteria. However, I believe the business is in the early stages of a multi-year growth story and that investors who buy today will capture a distinct opportunity in the e-commerce space that is operating at well below its future potential."
2675505,75405,2014-11-12T17:11:00-05:00,"Groupon's business model has been restructured to combat previous flaws.The recovering world economy, along with the holiday season could mean a profitable future for Groupon if it continues on its current trajectory.The stock price could see additional upside after Q4 results.","Q3 results sent Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock higher, eroding concerns of analysts, who did not believe in the company's current business model. Since the day of its report (October 30), GRPN is up 35.2%, as of Wednesday's close. As Groupon looks to expand North American and international sales, while attempting to improve efficiency in its goods business, the company appears to have at least partially overcome difficulties such as issues with email marketing and redemptions.Groupon made a dedicated effort to evaluate its financial and strategic options, even hiring advisers who would the company improve its strategy. The move paid off, as overall gross billings increased 39% annually, which includes stepped up growth in North America (16%), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (10%) and the Rest of the World (155%). Every Groupon division improved, lifting Q3 revenue 27% year-over-year to $757.1 million.Promising ProspectsGroupon's Q2 didn't go quite as well as Q3. Despite recording a profit, the company failed to impress investors. Subsequently, its stock price plummeted 49%. There were two major reasons why the seemingly positive second-quarter earnings triggered a collapse in the stock.First, the company's outlook was below Wall Street expectations. More importantly, the total value of merchandise sold was lower than that of previous years. In Q2, revenues stood at $568 million, leaving many rather skeptical about the company's future performance. The crucial factor to note here is that the company's recent initiatives have paid off, even if they took some time to transpire.Another promising prospect is Groupon's new mobile application, Snap, which was downloaded more than a million times over the past few months since its release. The app helped bring about the 10% rise in North American sales this quarter, as consumers are now shifting toward the convenience of mobile to fulfill their needs. Groupon has also taken note of the blazing revenue growth in the ""Rest of the World"" division, and is reportedly open to the idea of partnering with businesses in Asia.With more than satisfactory results in Q3, the outlook for Groupon looks good. A recovering world economy might play a role in the company's resurgence. In October, the head of the US Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, announced that the final tranche of bonds under its quantitative easing program would be bought that month. It is expected that the Fed will start raising interest rates as early as 2015. In other words, the central bank of the United States is showing faith in the economy's recovery and is putting its money where its mouth is. With national consumption on the rise, companies such as Groupon, and even rivals like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), are likely to reap benefits.A further boost for Groupon will be the forthcoming holiday season, which nearly always manages to bring in a hefty rise in sales. If the company manages to continue on its current trajectory, it can potentially see substantial earnings in Q4, as well as another pop in its stock price.ConclusionGroupon stock has seen its share of volatility this year. After Q2 earnings failed to impress, share price plummeted by more than 45%. Over the last year, the share price has seen a high of $12.42 per share and a low of $5.18 per share.The company experienced difficulty when performance dwindled, resulting in the dismissal of its CEO, Andrew Mason in March 2013. Under the new leadership of Eric Lefkofsky, Groupon sought to redeem itself by restructuring its business model. It took some time for the changes to materialize, even resulting in the stock crashing earlier this year (post-Q2 results); but now that things are starting to gel, it seems like Groupon's future looks rather bright. The stock price will most likely see a significant positive impact after Q4 results, which could translate into short-term capital gains for investors."

There has been no indication that Groupon wants to sell itself nor has there been any indication that Alibaba wants to buy Groupon.Still, I think this scenario makes some sense.For Alibaba, an acquisition of Groupon would be a good way to enter the U.S. and European markets.At the end of Q3, Groupon had over 250 million subscribers and 53 million active customers, most of them outside of China. By buying Groupon, Alibaba would instantly have tens of millions of customers in the U.S. and Europe, giving Alibaba a sizable initial base to grow from.Furthermore, given the $5 billion market cap, Groupon would be a bite-sized acquisition for Alibaba, which currently has a market cap of around $300 billion.With its greater resources and better track record of execution, Alibaba could potentially make better progress in unlocking Groupon's potential than Groupon management has.I think there is more optionality to Groupon than the market believes. Google did, after all, attempt to buy Groupon in 2010 for $6 billion. With all its potential, Groupon is still an attractive target to big internet companies out there and this optionality represents more upside for Groupon."

Nearly two years since they fired their founder Andrew Mason, the stock hasn’t fared significantly better. The company continues to try new ways to reignite the earlier growth and deliver the financial performance the market desires.Groupon’s Financials Groupon’s third quarter revenues grew 27% over the year to $757.1 million, exceeding the market’s expectations of $748.8 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.03 was also ahead of the Street’s projections of $0.01 for the quarter.During the quarter, Groupon saw gross billings grow 39% to $1.86 billion. North America billings improved 16% and that of EMEA grew 10% over the year. They reported an impressive 155% in billings from the Rest of World, but that was attributed to the acquisition of Ticket Monster last year. The increase in gross billings translated to a growth of 16% in North American revenues, 56% in EMEA revenues and 26% in revenues from the Rest of World.Among operating metrics, Groupon’s sales of vouchers and products before cancellations and refunds improved 92% over the year to 88 million. They ended the quarter with average active deals growing 25% sequentially to 300,000. North American active deals accounted for more than 120,000 at the end of the quarter. Active customers for the site improved 24% to 52.7 million as of September 2014. Of this, 23.5 million users were in North America, 14.9 million in EMEA, and 14.3 million in Rest of World. Groupon also saw an increase in trailing twelve month billings per average active customer that increased marginally to $149 during the quarter compared with $141 a quarter ago. Mobile transactions accounted for more than half of their business and they reported over 100 million app downloads.For the current quarter, Groupon forecast revenues of $875 million-$925 million with an EPS of $0.02-$0.04. The market was looking for revenues of $926.3 million for the quarter with an EPS of $0.07.Groupon’s Strategy Groupon has highlighted three key focus areas for growth for the future. First, they are interested in reaccelerating local growth in their markets, especially in North America. Second, they want to improve the gross margins and operating efficiency of their goods business and finally, they want to achieve stability in their international markets and reduce losses in the Rest of the World operations.Earlier last month, they released Groupon Pages, a listing of more than 7 million local merchants in the US. Groupon Pages includes merchant information along with over 20 million validated ratings and tips from real customers in reference to local businesses. Additionally, merchants can use Pages as part of their online presence tool and connect with more customers by releasing exclusive offers, everyday specials, and other promotions.Groupon has also been increasing their mobile footprint. They recently released a new Groupon Getaways travel discovery app that comes with enhanced travel search features. The app claims to provide their users with access to more than 25,000 destinations in a fast and simple manner. It comes with search criteria such as browsing by Theme, same day bookings, searching for a deal within a map area and access to exclusive travel deals including flash sales that take as offer as much as a 60% discount on hotels and vacation packages.They are also embracing mobile payment capabilities and announced integration with Apple Pay that will let users make secure purchases from the Groupon app on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.It appears that Groupon may be mulling over putting Ticket Monster back on sale. Groupon bought the South Korean company last year for an estimated $260 million. During the recent earnings call, Groupon informed how they had hired financial experts to advise them on the financing and strategic options for the Ticket Monster group.Groupon’s stock is trading at $7.80 with a market capitalization of $5.23 billion.

2561645,72215,2014-10-14T16:01:45-04:00,"Till the end of August, 2014, GRPN fell by 40% over 12 months. Since then, it has recovered by 22%, largely because of the company's new offerings.In the previous quarter, a 44% y-o-y increase in the number of bookings was reported by the company and 6% of its total revenue came from the travel segment.The negative brand image, along with the intensity of effort needed by the company to ensure regular sales, can cause the company to lose out financially in the future.At present, it looks like the company has been taking sufficient steps to ensure that it counters the issues that led to the initial decline in its stock price.However, the company needs to shift from its ""push strategy"" when it comes to sales and encourage subscribers to search for deals themselves, instead of relying completely on company emails.","Up until August 2014, Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock fell by almost 40% within the span of 12 months. Since August, however, the company's stock has seen some improvement in its price and has managed to increase by 22%. It is evident that the company has been taking steps to ensure that its stock's value does not fall any further by engaging in improved product development and expanding its mobile platform. However, investors are still concerned about whether the company will manage to continue with this upward trend in stock prices or if stock prices will start falling again. Let's take a look at the factors that have increased the stock prices and can push the stock up further along with the factors that can cause stock prices to fall.What has caused the stock to go up recently?Groupon has realized the importance of improving its offerings and has been working on doing so. Recently, it launched a new time-based deals option for local businesses that make reservations or take appointments. Initially, this is only available for restaurants but Groupon plans on expanding this to other sectors with time. Restaurant managers have been particularly pleased with this initiative as it gives them more control over when the customer visits the restaurant and busy restaurants have found this particularly useful as it allows tables to be filled during off-peak hours.Groupon also has been making active efforts to ensure that its mobile platform is strengthened. It announced a partnership with the popular app Snapchat after the launch of the time based deals option. Snapchat users can follow a link that they receive on the Snapchat interface which is the basic reason behind this partnership. Groupon wants to build a strong mobile presence because of the fact that it wants to emphasize itself as an e-commerce platform. It is important for Groupon to establish its presence in this segment because mobile commerce volumes have been increasing. People like to enjoy the convenience of being able to purchase and redeem their groupons through their mobile devices. In the first six months of 2014, North America has seen 19% growth in its number of active customers.Why can the upward trend in stock prices be expected to continue?Groupon offers discounted hotel stays along with several vacation packages. Since travel is an emerging segment of value, Groupon's presence in this segment can allow its stock to increase in value. In the previous quarter, a 44% y-o-y increase in the number of bookings was reported by the company and 6% of its total revenue came from the travel segment. Despite the fact that at present this is a small operation for the company, growth in the travel segment could mean higher profitability for the company. At the same time, the company also is trying to focus on improving its profit margins. The e-commerce business, which Groupon has been heavily focusing on, is a low margin business. However, with the growth in the travel segment, Groupon's overall profitability can be expected to increase.But what can cause the stock price to fall?At present, Groupon mostly relies upon a ""push strategy"" to encourage customers to purchase deals. The company sends almost a quarter of a billion emails daily to ensure sales of groupons. Irrelevant emails being sent to subscribers daily also have negatively impacted its brand image. At times, the groupons expire before the users even get the chance to use them. The company needs to ensure that subscribers start searching for deals in order for the company to adopt a ""pull strategy"" for the sale of groupons. In March 2014, only 9% of the company's traffic in North America was generated via searches online. This is something that the company needs to work on. The negative brand image can cause the company to lose out financially in the future.So what should the investors expect?At present, it looks like the company has been taking sufficient steps to ensure that it counters the issues that led to the initial decline in its stock price. This is evident by the fact that ever since the company has increased its efforts to improve its performance, the shares have managed to go up. The company's focus on improving its mobile presence will lead to the generation of higher sales. Its innovative steps, such as its partnership with Snapchat, will allow it to grow further and will allow for its brand image to be strengthened. Furthermore, the opportunities that the travel segment has for the company, if realized, can also allow it to improve its financial performance. However, the company needs to shift from the ""push strategy"" when it comes to sales and encourage subscribers to search for the deals they need rather than relying solely on the emails sent by the company."
2671595,56382,2014-11-11T17:53:20-05:00,Groupon surprised Wall Street by delivering a bottom line beat.It plans to roll out Gnome aggressively to provide a real-time network to customers and merchants.Groupon is improving its distribution and launching mobile apps to attract more users to its platform.,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) better-than-expected Q3 earnings finally brought relief to investors, who have struggled with lackluster performance for most of 2014. Since the day of the report (October 30), the company's shares have soared roughly 30%. For a complete recap of the numbers, see the Seeking Alpha transcript of Groupon's earnings conference call.Creating a cutting-edge network to attract customers and merchantsApart from making the services it offers consumers better, Groupon is expanding its global reach through partnerships and acquisitions. Recently, the company made another addition to its existing product fleet by way of a tablet-based checkout register that will enable users to find businesses and other information they require. This is a part of its Gnome program, which puts the company in direct competition with Square and eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal.With the help of tablet-based registers, Groupon can create a foundation for a local commerce network which focuses on connecting users and merchants in real-time. As a result of this move, customers will be able to shop for the lowest-cost items, while merchants will have an option of bringing customers into their fold by offering the best deals, by way of incentives and discounts, in real-time.Groupon has grand plans for this initiative. As discussed on the above-linked conference call, the company has deployed more than 6,000 tablets into the market, but since its merchant base exceeds 300,000 globally, it will continue launching more tablets.Omni-channel and distribution initiatives have the potential to provide additional upsideTo help increase its reach, Groupon is focusing on omni-channel initiatives, including mobile apps. The app has received a good response so far, as more than 100 million users have already downloaded it. In addition, Groupon recently launched an app called Snap that will help users save money on daily household items. The company has concentrated on improving the quality of its local deals in a bid to attract more customers.Groupon is also focused on improving margins through various measures, such as moving more of its fulfillment operation to its own distribution center in Kentucky, shifting an increasing part of its business to the drop-ship model and increasing units sold for every order. This improvement in its margins will yield better earnings in the future, just like last quarter.In addition, management has identified a few verticals that will improve the customer experience. The first focuses on increasing supply so Groupon can provide the best deals to its customers. Groupon also noted that it wants to ensure that it gets the right deals in front of the right customers. Through these moves, the company should be able to attract more customers and merchants to its platform.Finally, to improve its balance sheet further, Groupon management is planning (The Wall Street Journal subscription required) to sell off some of its stake in Ticket Monster, which it bought 10 months ago for $260 million. According to Bloomberg, ""The Company said it hired advisers to evaluate financial and strategic options that could unlock shareholder value, citing the growth opportunities for South Korea's Ticket Monster and the rest of its Asian operations."" This would improve Groupon's cash flow and give it more resources to grow the business going forward.ConclusionGroupon's comeback seems to have finally materialized. Looking ahead, the company is focusing on steps to improve the business further. A strong balance sheet will help it in this regard. This is a debt-free company with $855 million in cash. Once it sells off some of its stake in Ticket Monster, its cash position will improve further. As a result, Groupon will have more resources to spend on growth. Considering the points discussed above, Groupon looks like a good bet for the long term."
2496255,22445,2014-09-15T14:13:00-04:00,"Apple's Payment system is a game-changer for the mobile payments space.Companies who have a very big footprint in the mobile commerce space, will benefit going forward.And Groupon being one of the largest mobile commerce companies in the world, will benefit more than most.","If one looks at what has been going on in the social space over the past several weeks, he will notice that Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock has been outperforming the space. In many cases by a lot.As you can see from the above chart, over the past month Groupon has delivered 23%, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) 19%, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) 16%, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) 6%, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) 3% and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) -5.5%.There are several reasons for this, however today I want to point to a more recent revelation, and that is the introduction of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6 and Apple Pay.The reason why the iPhone 6 and Apple Pay are so important to Groupon, is because they will make it much more easy for Groupon to do business. That's correct, to a great extent, Groupon is dependent on smartphone devices. So the simpler it becomes for consumers to pay for products and services with smartphone devices, the better for companies like Groupon. Let me explain.To begin with, Groupon receives over 50% of its transactions on mobile. Which means that mobile users are more apt to purchase something Groupon sells via mobile than via the desktop.Apple has about 42% of the U.S. smartphone market. And since Apple Pay is almost certain to become the NFC mobile payment standard, it means that all those who in the future who will have an iPhone 6, will probably (most likely) use Apple Pay to purchase products and services.However, since Groupon already has one of the 25 most-downloaded apps in Apple's App Store, with about 92 million downloads, it also means that Groupon is one of the largest mobile commerce companies in the world.And like I said on my last post on Apple (please consider: Apple's iPhone 6: Size Matters), size matters in the smartphone space. Personally, I think Apple will gain a substantial percent of the U.S. market over the next 12- 18 months or so, mainly at the expense of Samsung.See, people who wanted a bigger phone in the past had to resort to smartphone manufacturers like Samsung. But now that Apple offers bigger size devices, people will go back to Apple. Donald Trump is probably one of them.So as more and more people use Apple's iPhone 6 devices, and since all those people are apt to use the iPhone 6 and Apple Pay for purchases, that means that Groupon will probably increase its transactions going forward. And as Groupon announced, it will be ready to do business on Apple Pay come next month.Bottom lineOne of the reasons why there was no clear leader in the payment space all these years is because the space was fragmented. However now that Apple has entered the space, and by virtue of the fact that Apple has about 42% of the U.S. smartphone market, it is probably fair to say that Apple Pay will become the standard in mobile payments going forward.Companies who have a big mobile commerce footprint stand benefit going forward, vs. companies who are pure retail, or companies who do not have a big mobile presence.And when Apple's iPhone 6 upgrade cycle is complete, one of the companies that are likely to benefit (and by a lot if you ask me) is Groupon. And if I am correct, that Groupon is the cheapest stock in the social space (please consider: Don't Count Groupon Out Just Yet), then Groupon will probably outperform the space by a lot for at least the next two years or so."
2640995,69825,2014-11-06T03:36:42-05:00,"Groupon earnings were a mixed bag, with top/bottom line beats and guidance weak.Groupon may need a new product category to be solidly profitable. With Groupon's large user base and fortress balance sheet, this could be doable.Ultimately, given the high valuation, Groupon is still a speculative stock.","Before Xiaomi and Uber, there was Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). In 2010, Groupon was the high growth startup, having seen its revenues and customer base grow by many magnitudes in a few short years. Who, after all, doesn't like a sale?At the time, Groupon, according to commentators and VC's alike, was poised to dominate local commerce. The startup attracted so much attention that it at one point received a buyout offer from Google for $6 billion that Groupon turned down.Three years later, a lot has changed.Eric Lefkofsky replaced founder Andrew Mason as CEO. The company cut costs by laying off a significant part of its staff. Groupon added direct categories travel and e-commerce goods to its product lineup.In terms of finances, Groupon is no longer growing the way it did in 2010. The company's third quarter revenue grew only 27% year over year to $757.1 million. Guidance for Q4 is similarly soft, with management expecting revenue to be between $875 million and $925 million. (To its credit, Groupon did earn $0.03 for the quarter and management is expecting earnings of $0.02-$0.04 for Q4. )Some things haven't changed, however. Groupon still has a lot of detractors, with 22% of the float short. The bears still believe Groupon doesn't have a moat and is destined for bankruptcy. They point to two specific things. First, despite the great growth, the direct goods division gross margin of under 10% is simply too thin to make Groupon profitable and second, given the huge required sales force and declining gross margins, the company's coupon business isn't very profitable either.Groupon has had roughly two years to turn the ship around. Over this time, Groupon has grown revenue, but has failed to produce meaningful profits. The company's Q3 earnings and guidance continues this trend.Still, the sky isn't falling. Groupon is going to be around for quite a while. The company has $855 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. With its hundred million plus customers and 800,000 merchants, Groupon has a large customer base to launch new products that may finally increase profits. The company has also successfully adjusted to mobile, with over 100 million mobile downloads so far.Personally I don't know if Groupon's core business will ever be solidly profitable. The margins are just too low. With a forward PE of 38, the company isn't cheap, either. Groupon still has the same potential as it had in 2010, but it needs to launch another successful product to regain its former luster."
2469735,24264,2014-09-04T02:21:59-04:00,"Groupon announced its new time-specific coupons on Wednesday.The innovative deal strategy should give it an edge over competition.As more consumers begin using Groupon, free cash flow and the company's share price should drastically rise.","Although Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) share price has taken a beating the past few years, new innovations could lead to large gains for investors. On Wednesday, the e-commerce company unveiled a new feature in its product strategy, letting businesses offer deals to users to be redeemed at a specific time in the day. Groupon says that the ability to set up and buy time-based deals are being rolled out first to restaurants, with the intention to expand into other categories like beauty salons, auto shops, educational classes, and more.The idea behind time-based deals is aimed at keeping customer flows constant throughout the day, even during non-peak hours, according to Tech Crunch. Groupon sees various benefits in the new offering. On the consumer side, it gives the company another route into presenting more flexible options for customers. On the business side, it gives Groupon the benefit of one more touchpoint with merchant customers. The time sensitive feature could also potentially be a competitive edge over other deal-based companies, such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and OpenTable.So far trials of the product have been implemented successfully in Chicago. In April, a Chicago-based Frontera Grill took part in the pilot program to help lure in younger people during harder-to-fill, late-night hours.The company said fifty-eight people used Frontera's Groupon during the pilot period, with 85% falling within the ages of 22 to 35. The average amount spent in addition to the Groupon coupon was $38.89, and seven of 29 tables spent more than $69 on additional food and drinks.In total, Frontera said the Groupon deal generated $1,626.93 in revenue on tables that would have otherwise been empty during 10 days over a two-week period. ""They're making it really easy for us to fill tables during off-peak times, which generates more revenue for the restaurant and gives us more opportunities to attract new customers and turn them into lifelong fans,"" said Chicago Frontera Grill owner Rick Bayless.Groupon's share price has declined nearly 70% since its 2012 highs. Increased competition and lack of competitive edge were cited as reasons for the decline. The share price has risen close to 25% over the past month, however, as optimistic speculation over the company's new strategies have come to light.Even as competition has increased, though, revenues have steadily improved. Groupon's Chief Executive Officer Eric Lefkofsky said during the conference call in August, ""Our local marketplace of over 240,000 deals continued to gain broader awareness. We reached another all-time high in mobile transactions, as nearly 92 million people have now downloaded our app, and our international business continued to stabilize and is now contributing nicely to our bottom line.""This consumer awareness has translated to accelerating revenues as seen below. Gross billings increased 29% to $1.82 billion, and revenue increased 23% to $752 million during the second quarter. Demand also remained healthy in North America, where billings grew 12% to $799 million, led by a 26% annual growth in our goods business and 44% growth in travel.Unfortunately, competition has begun to show up on the income statement, as can be seen in flat to slightly falling operating margins from 2012 to present day. Larger companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have made an effort to offer deals similar to Groupon, while Yelp and Living Social are constant thorns in the company's side. Groupon hopes that new innovation will help relieve margins, which could drive up the bottom line.Lastly, free cash flow has broadly declined since July 2012 as investment in international expansion mobile has taken a bite out of excess cash. In 2014, management outlined that a primary objective was to achieve stability in international operations. Although operating losses in the second quarter were $18 million for its foreign segment, this can be attributed to investment costs that were larger than originally anticipated. Despite the recent quarter, management believes developing markets are on track to generate positive segment operating income by Q4. Alongside a few key investments, the shutdown of Groupon Korea also contributed to declines in cash flow.With regards to mobile investment, the company is now beginning to see a return on its strategic moves. Chief Financial Officer Jason Child said during the call, ""Our local mobile and marketplace investments together with Genome represent the culmination of years of hard work and significant investment, which we believe firmly positions us to realize our vision of connecting local commerce.""Over 50% of Groupon's business is mobile, worldwide, as of the most recent quarter. ""We're, again, at an all-time high. 92 million people have downloaded our app, another all-time high,"" said Lefkofsky.As investments begin to pay off and new initiatives are enacted, Groupon's stock could begin to gain upward momentum. Management expects free cash flow to pick up materially in the back half of the year as strategic investments turn from operating loss to profit. Groupon faces stiff competition, but improved exposure on mobile devices and innovative product strategies could catapult its share price higher from record lows."
2622685,60151,2014-11-01T04:09:17-04:00,"Groupon reported better than expected earnings, but guidance was a bit light.This report is in line with my expectations and I don't think the reward is worth the risk in betting on GRPN in either direction.I previously discussed how although Groupon is maintaining nice top line growth, its margins would deteriorate with an influx of competition.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) announced Q3 earnings and beat on both the top and bottom lines. GRPN reported $757.1 million in revenue (+27.1% Y/Y), beating estimates by $8.3 million and EPS of $0.03, beating estimates by $0.02. However, management guided for Q4 revenue of $875 million-$925 million, which is below consensus estimates of $926.3 million. Moreover, management expects EPS between $0.02-$0.04, but analysts were expecting $0.07.Although revenue increased a hefty 27.1% Y/Y, gross profit only increased a paltry 5.8%, as margins continue to shrink. Another metric that causes concern is that active customer growth is waning. GRPN reported a 24% Y/Y increase this quarter, which is down from 25% last quarter. Although that doesn't represent much of a slowdown, it is unquestionable that the growth is no longer accelerating and GRPN will need to focus on selling more to current customers or increasing margins to justify its lofty trading multiples, such as a one year forward PE ratio of more than 150x.GRPN PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsI previously discussed how GRPN would face a tough future ahead, with the influx of competition deteriorating margins. However, the short thesis has largely played out and the downside is a bit limited here with it having $855 million in cash. Its market capitalization is just above $4 billion, so although I believe the upside is limited, the downside is as well. I suggest that investors remain on the sideline, as the company could be an acquisition candidate. GRPN is certainly not worth the risk in betting on either direction."
2471675,56382,2014-09-04T14:31:24-04:00,"Groupon has taken a beating in 2014, but the company's strong growth and impressive fundamentals cannot be ignored.
        Groupon is seeing rapid growth in mobile and it is making its platform better for both merchants and users by introducing products like Pages and Gnome.
        Groupon is undertaking moves to improve margins, while a drop in the number of unused coupons indicates that its business is gaining traction.","A look at Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock price chart in 2014 shows that the company is having a really bad time. In fact, Groupon has lost a massive 40% of its market capitalization so far this year. But, at the same time, it cannot be ignored that the company has sound fundamentals and is reporting terrific revenue growth.Strong results and fundamentals should not be ignoredIn the recently reported second quarter, Groupon delivered an impressive year over year jump of 23% in revenue. But, because the company's loss widened from the year-ago period, its shares fell and investors started selling in panic. But, Groupon's increased expenses were related to the acquisitions of Ticket Monster and Ideeli, coupled with a jump in overall marketing expense.The company has been employing sound strategies to grow its business, and this is seen in its rapid revenue growth. At the same time, Groupon has a good balance sheet. It has cash of $868 million and no debt. In addition, it recently opened up a revolving line of credit worth $250 million, giving itself more flexibility to invest in growth. Moreover, Groupon is cash flow positive, generating operating cash flow of $123 million in the past year, along with $183 million in levered free cash flow.Moreover, its bottom line growth is expected to outperform the industry average over the next five years. Analysts expect Groupon to deliver annual growth of 27% in the bottom line, while the industry's growth is pegged at 21%. Considering these points, it looks likely that Groupon will get better in the long run, which is why its drop this year looks like a buying opportunity.The business is getting betterThe company is seeing good traction in mobile. For example, Groupon witnessed a record high in mobile transactions last quarter, as about 92 million people have already downloaded its app. There's solid demand for its services in North America as well, with 12% increase in billings to $799 million last quarter, led by a 26% year-over-year growth in its goods business and 44% growth in travel.To achieve growth in the long run, Groupon will be focusing on certain key areas. First, it's focused on re-accelerating its local growth in North America and abroad. Second, it is looking to improve the gross margin and operating efficiency of its goods business. Finally, Groupon is striving to achieve stability in its international operations and minimize its losses globally to ensure that it generates positive segment operating income by the year-end for every region it operates in, excluding the impact from acquisitions.Initiatives to drive growthThe company is moving in the right direction with these initiatives. It is already seeing positive sentiment in the market, as there was a decline of over 25% in the average number of unused Groupons per customer last year. This drop is a sound indicator of customers' willingness to buy more. Additionally, Groupon has widened the site-wide sales and order discounts for the last few quarters in order to drive the adoption of its marketplace.Going forward, Groupon intends to pass on a portion of these promotional discounts to its merchants, and these efforts are expected to improve the take rates in the local segment, and maintain them within the healthy range as seen in the last couple of years.The second priority of Groupon is to ramp up its goods margins, predominantly in North America. Groupon has made some crucial changes to its operations to reduce its rising historical costs as compared to other ecommerce companies. These moves includes shifting more of its business toward drop shipping, and shifting a large part of fulfilment operations to its own distribution center in Kentucky, apart from accelerating units per order.Impressive innovationAdditionally, Groupon targets on increasing its share of merchants currently working with the company from 5% to 100% by launching two new products, Pages and Gnome. The company has already built pages for a large number of merchants in North America, and will start introducing them in the coming quarters.Groupon is also keen on reducing its dependence on emailed daily-deal offers by diversifying into the sale of physical goods and discounts accessed through mobile phones. Groupon has introduced a tablet-computer-based cash-register system called Gnome during the second quarter to compete with Square, PayPal, and others. Hence, the company is working on making the experience for its customers easier.Now, when Gnome is combined with approximately 92 million people who have already downloaded its apps, it will be able to set up the foundation of a local commerce network where users and merchants are always connected. This will enable consumers to discover the world around them and cut costs, and also empower merchants to offer real-time discounts and incentives to entice the right customers.ConclusionConsidering Groupon's strategies, investors should not be discouraged by the company's wider-than-expected loss last quarter. The company is investing in its business to improve its performance in the long run, and as we saw above, it should become profitable in the due course of time. Thus, it is advisable for investors to consider buying Groupon's shares by utilizing the stock's massive drop this year."
2462825,24580,2014-09-01T06:35:44-04:00,"The net loss for the six months ending June 2014 widened to $60 million from only $11 million last year, due to lower operating margins.
        The company’s lack of profitability coupled with a continuous decline in margins is its greatest impediment to establishing a sustainable uptrend.
        Groupon GAAP EPS is still expected to come out negative in Q3 2014.","Groupon Inc (NASDAQ: GRPN) shares slumped 15% on August 6, following the announcement of its Q2 2014 results, which displayed a continuous downslide in profitability with adjusted EBITDA declining to $59 million from $81 million in Q2 2013. The net loss for the six months ended in June 2014 also widened to $60 million from only $11 million last year, due to lower operating margins.The business model of the company, a local online marketplace offering huge discounts to consumers through its specialized deals with merchants remains one of its biggest challenges to profitability. The model appears to promise continuous growth in revenue, but is hampered by the huge discounting, which has resulted into weak and declining margins.The company has expanded into the traditional e-commerce business by selling physical goods, but this segment of business is yet to get to the level where it contributes the majority of the revenues generated.Nonetheless, there is good progress in the goods business with its contribution to overall revenue increasing from 31% last year to 40% now. This is a positive sign of reduced concentration in the local discounts model. The gross revenue improved to $1.5 billion in H1 2014 from $1.2 billion last year. The gross margin has reduced year-on-year from 27% to 21%.While shares plunged following Q2 results, there were still some positives to pick outThe number of active deals increased to 240,000 from 200,000 in Q1 2014 with the number of active customers increasing by 25% year-on-year to 53 million. This shows that Groupon's business base is widening and thus increasing the potential for revenue generation.The company is also making impressive advances in mobile following the launch of the Gnome application. In the most recent quarter, the mobile business represented more than 50% of total transactions, and according to estimates, it is set to increase with the introduction of Gnome application.Meanwhile, North America continues to contribute a majority of revenue with over 22 million active customers. However, Asia pacific appears to be gaining momentum following the 145% growth, and hence should help leverage on the overall revenue in the coming quarters.Groupon expects to shore-up revenues, but no signs of profitability yetThe company's outlook for full year 2014 provides mixed expectations with adjusted EBITDA expected to be about $270 million. The company also expects a double-digit growth in revenues powered by growth from Rest of the world (especially Asia Pacific) which grew by 145% in Q2.On the other hand, Groupon GAAP EPS is still expected to come out negative in Q3 2014. However, based on Q2 earnings release, the company expects a non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.02. This is still a major concern for the company, as it generally implies zero improvement from Q2, which posted a non-GAAP EPS of $0.01.The company's lack of profitability coupled with a continuous decline in margins is its greatest impediment to establishing a sustainable uptrend, and appears set to continue being so until a point where the goods business will begin contributing a majority of the revenues.Groupon completed a share repurchase program worth $100 million in Q2 to compensate for lack of dividends. This is anticipated to continue in the future, which should be a massive boost for the company's stock price, but it can only go for so long, before Groupon begins to feel the pinch.Now the cash balance of $868 million appears healthy enough to finance a couple more share repurchase programs, but this could also raise questions about the company's ambitions towards reinvesting in the business. The company also has a revolving credit facility of $250 million available, which together with the cash balance could be useful in settling operational expenses.Not enough cheer to investorsThe stock price of the company has been battered over the past two years. Following its listing in 2011, Groupon's stock price plunged to trade at lows of $2-$3 in late 2012. During 2013, it saw a brief resurgence as investors bet on growing revenues, thereby propelling the stock to reach the $12 level.GRPN data by YChartsHowever, in 2014 the stock price has again fallen to $6-$7 level, as it continued to become evident to investors that Groupon's business model suffers from low margins, which have resulted into widening of the net loss.Now, investors appear to be very cautious on Groupon, and are certainly lacking conviction especially judging by recent performances. Over the last two weeks, the company stock appears to be on a short-term recovery trend, but the extension of its rally remains curtailed, as there seems to be no genuine catalysts to propel the stock to new heights. Indeed, such has been the case since May this year.ConclusionBased on the current price levels, the short-term outlook appears to be bearish, up until at least the announcement of Q3 quarter results. If the company can reduce its net loss, comparable to previous period (year-over-year and sequentially), then there is a genuine chance of a recovery.The company's Q2 results illustrated increasing margins from the Goods and Travel business segments, which improved year-on-year to 21% and 10%, from 16% and 9%, respectively. This could also provide renewed optimism, is the trend continues, possibly signaling good prospect towards profitability. In addition, increasing the share of the traditional e-commerce business can go a long way towards compensating for losses in the discount deals business.The long-term trend could change in FY15 as the company still has growth potential in revenues. Its problem of weak margins can improve with a strategic shift in business model oriented towards marketplace sales of goods.The bottom line is that in the near-term, Groupon appears to offer little cheer to investors, but with a shifting strategy, the company could be on the verge of a major turnaround as it now switches focus to goods business. This will set it up against industry rivals like eBay and Amazon, among others, but with daily deals business still in place, this could augment the goods business by providing a possible source of customers.Therefore, Groupon does appear to be on the mend, but investors are certainly lacking conviction on how and when this will all begin paying off."
2441385,41741,2014-08-21T09:25:24-04:00,"Groupon posted another mixed quarter leading to an initial 18% selloff in the stock.The company does have a couple interesting initiatives given its push to mobile, but will it be enough?.Given the amount of marketing spend and sales force required to sustain revenues, Groupon's future remains cloudy.","Shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) have been a perennial underperformer since IPOing in 2011. Shares tumbled after Q2 results, falling as much as 18% in a day. They've since climbed back. While the volatility has been great news for traders, for investors, it's been a sickening roller coaster ride.Recent quarterly results rigamaroleIts Q1 results from earlier this year were mixed. Revenues were up 26% y/y, but consolidated segment operating income came in at $5.6 million -- down 90% y/y. Along with Q1 results, Groupon guided for Q2 revenue to be $725 million to $775 million -- below $754 million consensus.For Q2, revenues came in at $752 million, increasing 23% y/y. But its consolidated segment operating income was again down year-over-year, coming in at $24.5 million -- down nearly 60% y/y.But there were positives, where Q2 was a record quarter in terms of demand and worldwide billings, reaching their highest level ever. Worldwide billings was $1.82 billion, against $1.41 billion in the previous year.What to expect for the rest of the yearThe outlook for Q3 2014 revenue and EBITDA was below expectations. Q3 guidance is for revenues to come in between $720 million and $770 million, compared to the previous consensus of $760 million. As well, EBITDA guidance of $50 million to $70 million was well below consensus of $77 million.Full year 2014 EBITDA is now expected to come in around $270 million, versus previous consensus at $293 million. Along with its guidance, the company made comments that it could do a better job of cutting marketing spend, but prefers to focus on long-term growth.Groupons future growth strategyManagement is attempting a three pronged strategy for growth:(1) One is to reignite growth in North America. Management believes that the improvement in revenues will be the result of people willing to buy more products, most notably, in their willingness to utilize mobile for purchases. The company remains poised to deliver double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in North America.(2) The second prong is to drive improvements in margins, especially in North America. For some time now, the company's costs have increased sharply, but it does plan to make strategic changes to reign in costs.These changes include moving the bulk of its business to a drop ship platform, handling more fulfillment from its own facility in Kentucky and increasing the number of units per order.(3) Groupon plans to continue pouring money into marketing initiatives with no clear idea of the long-term return on investment. Marketing expenses were $64 million in Q2 2014, up from $56 million in the same quarter last year. But the big question remains; can Groupon continue growing revenues while tapering marketing spending?Then there's mobileThe company is witnessing progress in its mobile segment as it navigates the consumer transition from desktop to mobile. Some 92 million people have downloaded its app and it ranks as one of the top mobile e-commerce companies in the world.The ability to successfully execute on mobile will rely a lot on its ability to continue to innovate. For example, being able to attract more merchants by providing them with the capability of variable deals, such as the time of day and day of the week.Two new products Groupon has in the works are Pages, which will create a web and mobile presence containing useful information about every merchant; and Genome is the new operating system to facilitate the redemption from merchants by customers of Groupons.Bottom lineGroupon does compete with the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) service, Google Offers. With that, could Google buy Groupon? Regardless, Google has a leg up with its Google Maps and other services, which provides a better daily deals experience. Google tried to buy Groupon in 2010 for almost $6 billion, but Groupon turned down the offer. Its market cap is now $4.2 billion.The big issue is that Groupon has yet to demonstrate that it can grow consistently and profitably. We aren't buyers at these levels, and wouldn't be until Groupon proves it can prove that it can reign in marketing and selling expenses to the point that it can generate positive income."
2438585,68555,2014-08-20T12:31:51-04:00,"Lowered outlook paints a clear picture of Groupon's unsustainable business model.Increasing competition will hurt Groupon.Even after losing almost 50% of its market cap, Groupon is still not an acquisition target.Increasing short interest is another negative.Groupon is a strong sell.","For Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), there seems to be no respite from a perpetual drop in the share price. In addition, the company's recent results were weak. Groupon, in the second quarter of 2014, reported revenue of $752 million, missing the consensus estimate of $762 million. Groupon's earnings came in at $0.01, just in line with the analysts' estimates.Although Groupon's quarterly performance wasn't that bad, the stock fell as much as 17% after the company reported Q2 results. Groupon lowered its outlook for the third quarter, and expects revenue of $720 million-$770 million on EPS of $0.02-$0.03. The lowered outlook highlights the fact that Groupon's turnaround doesn't look likely and the company will continue to struggle. Let's take a look at the reasons why I think Groupon is a strong sell candidate.What gives?Although Groupon's revenue grew 26% year-on-year, but with its declining gross margins, this revenue could only convert to just 2% higher gross profits. The company is doing very well when it comes to increasing sales, revenue, and acquiring a base among customers, but is unable to keep up with the profit margins.Groupon shares rose more than 5% after Priceline (PCLN) announced that it is acquiring online reservation service provider OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), due to which Groupon will have one competitor less to face. This is what excited the investors, but there is another side to the story too.Groupon's restaurant reservation service, known as Groupon Serve, which was launched last year, helps customers to find and book tables and receive discounts on their restaurant bills, while OpenTable is a restaurant reservation player which seats over 15 million diners every month at around 31,000 restaurants across the world.Now, as it is known that Priceline is a huge hotel and flight reservations company with a market cap of $60 billion, it will use OpenTable to serve its customers with an integrated solution which will allow the booking of flights, hotels and restaurants handily. Hence, this acquisition is straightaway a threat for Groupon.Intense competitionGroupon will have to struggle hard to turn in profits while competing against industry giants such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Amazon is one of the biggest online players, selling products at aggressively low prices so as to gain market share, even at the cost of profit margins.On the other hand, eBay works differently. It is an e-commerce platform and not a retailer, though it has established a solid position in its segment. Also, with a valuable strategic asset like PayPal, eBay continues to encounter success.Groupon's turnaround is what was likely to help it in the future, but that too isn't working in favor of the company. Even if the turnaround goes on well, as expected by management, there are still possibilities of the firm's stock to be highly volatile.Not an acquisition targetGroupon has underperformed the industry by a huge margin. The company's net income has decreased by almost 850% year-over-year, while the net operating cash flow plummeted nearly 340% in the same time period.The fundamental weakness has resulted in an obvious drop in share price. Groupon is down over 44% this year, and this has led many investors to believe that the company is ripe for a takeover bid for companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL). The acquisition of OpenTable by Priceline has further fueled the optimism. However, this may not happen. Google already has a big market share in the advertising market, and it will not waste money on acquiring Groupon. Thus, I think acquisition is off the table.Short interestDespite the ""cheap valuation"", the short interest in Groupon is consistently rising. As of June 30th, there was short interest totaling 80,506,749 shares, a growth of 6.0% from the June 13th total of 75,974,617 shares. This means that currently, over 17% of Groupon shares are sold short, and not everyone believes in its turnaround story. The high short interest is understandable, as Groupon has an unsustainable business structure. The company's revenue growth has not translated into a growth in profitability, and the high operating expense ensures that this trend will continue.ConclusionHence, it can be said that there is no point in investing in Groupon. The company is under severe pressure from different areas, and the increasing competition will hurt its performance further. So, it will be a good idea for investors to keep a safe distance from Groupon."
2431575,39301,2014-08-18T09:55:52-04:00,"Mobile growth is a strong indicator for future success.New initiatives like genome and pages lead to cross-sell opportunities, and ecosystem benefits.Earnings are deflated due to an investment year.Free-cash-flow should improve as a result of closing non-performing segments, paired with greater economies of scale.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been dead money for quite a while, and while on-going risk factors impair the company's fundamentals, the strategy going forward is compelling, and growth opportunities in new categories make it a compelling investment opportunity over the foreseeable future.Why Groupon is chasing after pull marketingThe company transitioned to pull marketing versus push marketing when it made its transition to mobile. Push marketing tends to be more effective on desktop, as it pushes out local deals via e-mail. PCs in general are not application-centric, meaning that content consumption has to be pushed via alternative mediums like e-mail, web pages, etc. The concept of push is ""web 2.0.""However, going forward it's likely that the next generation of the web will be contextual. Groupon has much more upside based on mobile active user growth, as the product can use location specific information to determine the type of deals to market along with the type of products and services that the user is interested in.I offer much more detail on the semantic/contextual web in prior articles. Groupon's mobile application is highly compatible for the future, as the device can quickly notify a user passing by a store that there's a Groupon special going on. Mobility of commerce has many implications, and some think that the retail store-front will change with concepts of e-wallets, less inventory, print-on-demand, and ya-da. But before any of that wildly sci-fi stuff happens, better information flow to consumers via notifications on smart watch, smartphone, or smart glasses will give consumers the needed information to pay less per retail transaction, or buy things they actually want to buy.Source: GrouponAt the present moment, Groupon cumulatively has 92 million downloads. The download figure is pretty impressive, as it's a mobile application that's intended to market limited time deals, or products sold at bulk-discount. Currently, the Groupon application has a 4.5/5 rating. That's a significantly higher rating than Amazon's 2.5/5 rating.People think mobile commerce will be purely driven via the showroom concept, i.e. walk into a retail store, take a picture of the product, find it on Amazon, and buy the product. Everyday low pricing has its own specific niche, but based on user rating of the Amazon mobile application, Groupon's promotional discounting has a much higher rating.I think the advantages carried by Groupon's core business model are largely intact, and while recent trends in top-line revenue/billings outlook wasn't exactly great, plus trends in profitability are ugly, the business has key developments in play that make it a compelling investment opportunity going forward.Product pipeline, plus merchant growth, gives it some upsideGroupon is launching two initiatives, pages and genome. According to Groupon, ""pages will be filled with useful information for users, including contract information, maps, time of service, recommendations, tips, and most importantly, wider variety of discounts."" Groupon mentions that it has built millions of pages, and it will be a couple quarters before they're fully rolled out. But based on the description of these pages from the earnings conference call, it's almost similar to Facebook pages, paired with Google reviews.Groupon is also launching a software service for its vendors, referred to as Genome. Genome offers the back-end software via an application compatible with iOS devices, making it easy to integrate into a standard retail operation. The application also comes with a card reader similar to square magnetic card reader. However, the advantage for retailers to go with Genome is the seamless integration of both merchant transaction services, with Groupon coupon redemptions. The combined impact is the opportunity to cross-sell vendors into Groupon's merchant services, which gives them a take-rate on service/merchandise volume, paired with Groupon's 50-50 revenue split with small businesses.Groupon mentions that further penetration into small business could be a growth engine:However, to appeal to the remaining 95% of merchants, Groupon should consider alternatives to the 50-50 revenue share model. Some small businesses will intentionally lose money for promotional activity, giving merchants the ability to earn profit from a Groupon event that may attract more merchants to its platform. Despite the pricing of the platform, the number of active deals continued to grow at a steady rate, whereas spend per active customer has declined (excluding impact from the Ticket Monster acquisition). The spend rate per consumer may improve, if a broader ecosystem of vendors offered its services, even on a limited basis.ConclusionStrategically, Groupon is well positioned. I think that the business will continue to attract merchants, and recent initiatives to cross-sell merchants, paired with new categories will drive billings growth at a fairly reasonable rate. However, difficulties with generating profitability due to compressing margins operating/gross margins have left investors skeptical over the profit-model of Groupon.I think that Groupon's sheer scale, paired with its ability to add monthly active users will drive both top-line growth and margins. Also, the profitability of Groupon should improve, as it has closed non-performing segments like Groupon Korea, and it's also coming out of an investment year where SG&A and cost of revenue are elevated.Overall, I think Groupon is a compelling growth investment going forward.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2622735,67313,2014-11-01T04:46:59-04:00,GRPN reported with an EPS and revenue beat. Guidance was light.eCommerce continues to be a key driver behind the platform while daily deals continues to be in a decline.I prefer GRPN post quarter.,"EventGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported 3Q14 results that beat on both EPS and revenue. EPS of $0.03 was $0.02 above consensus while revenue of $757m (+27% y/y) beat by $8.3m. Guidance was light with Q4 revenue expected to be between $875m - $925m (vs. cons. $926m) and EPS between $0.02 - $0.04 (vs. cons. $0.07). However, I believe that GRPN is gradually making the right strategic moves that are necessary to sustain its near-term growth, namely the shift towards more ecommerce flash sales similar to that of VIP (VIP) and TMall (NYSE:BABA) could attract incremental traffic on the website and higher engagement level. Moreover, the potential partnership in Asia could further diversify GRPN's revenue stream from North America, which accounts for over half of GRPN's Q3 revenue. I continue to believe that group-buy sites that have scale and brand are likely to survive in this low-margin industry and GRPN is top on my list. I'm reiterating my bullish view on the stock.HighlightsRamping up ecommerce. Gross billing increased +39% y/y to $1.86b with revenue coming in at $757m (+27% y/y). EMEA continue to see the highest growth rate with revenue +55%, vs. North America's +16%. Deal-driven revenue continues to be in a decline, down -3% to $297m while ecommerce revenue +63% y/y to $411m, followed by travel at $49m (+35% y/y). Despite the low margin profile, I expect the ecommerce segment to ramp up to become a key revenue driver at GRPN and could potentially increase GRPN's web traffic and engagement level as users look for attractive deals. Total active customers were 52.7m at the end of the quarter (+24% y/y) and we could see an acceleration once more products are features on the site.Looking for growth in Asia. GRPN indicated that it is looking for a partner for its Asian ops, which includes the Korean deal site, Ticket Monster, which the company acquired for $260m last year. In my view, an established ecommerce player that is looking to grow its presence in Asia could be an attractive partner for GRPN. There could be a certain degree of synergy between the company, as the less popular items on the ecommerce site could be carried over to the group-buy side that sell the product at a significant discount. Although still early in the stage, I expect the finding of a potential partner to be a near-medium term catalyst for the stock.ConclusionLong GRPN post results on the back of strong ecommerce growth and the potential deal with an Asian partner."
2413615,22445,2014-08-12T08:14:59-04:00,"Groupon missed the street expectations, but the current price already reflects this.Even so, it is still a buy and hold based on its current valuation.With a little luck, Groupon can easily double in the next 12-18 months, which is more than I can say for many other stocks in the social space.","Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) latest quarter was not exactly bad, simply not what the market expected. For the second quarter of 2014, the company announced $1.82 billion in billings, revenue of $751 million, adjusted EBITDA of $59.1 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.01 per share.While 23% in revenue growth is not bad, the market was modeling $761 million in revenue. Also, what really spooked the market was third quarter guidance. The company's guidance calls for revenue between $720 million to $770 million, with EPS guidance flat to $0.02 per share, when the consensus was $769 million in revenue and an after tax profit of 0.03 a share. So obviously the street had something to be bearish about.However, given the valuation of Groupon, the company's quarterly miss is more than backed in the current valuation. In fact, even if Groupon lost money, it still remains one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest stock in the social space. Let me explain why.One of the best ways to win in this game over the long term, is to try to buy low and sell high. But buying low and selling high is relative. Do you buy a low stock priced or a low valuation stock?In Groupon's case, I think investors should focus on the low valuation. The question is, how do we determine a low valuation? In Groupon's case, I prefer the Price/Sales metric.Currently the consensus is that Groupon will book $3.2 billion in revenue for 2014 and about $3.65 billion for 2015. So growth is projected to be about 10% for next year, which for a social stock is poor, but one has to put that in perspective and look at what you pay for the stock today.If we look at Groupon's current valuation, the stock trades at a Price/Sales ratio of about 1.25 for 2014 and 1.1 times revenue for 2015.Now let's look at two other similar stocks in the space -- Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) -- and what their valuation is on a Price/Sales basis.(Data based on analyst consensus estimates from yahoo.com)Granted this is not an apples-to-apples comparison, however these companies have a lot of similarities and yet they are valued so differently.Groupon currently trades at an estimated 2015 Price/Sales ratio of 1.1. This is about as low as they come in the entire social space, including many other stocks not mentioned above.What does such a low Price/Sales ratio mean?For one thing, it means that Groupon has limited downside, even in the event that it misses street expectations in the future.The second thing it means is that there is a lot of upside potential to the stock, if in the future higher growth is reignited.Yelp for example currently trades at 16 time sales. I am sorry, but this is just about as good as it gets for any stock. Groupon can miss again and again and it might not mean much for the stock. If Yelp misses, you better watch out below, because there is a very big difference between a Price/Sales ratio of 16 and 1.Bottom lineWhile Groupon missed street expectations for the quarter, the truth of the matter is that its revenue miss is already reflected in the stock price today.The low Price/Sales ratio also means the stock has a very good cushion, if in the future things don't turn out so good.Finally, the way to make money in this game is to buy low and sell high. Groupon can, with a little luck, easily double over the next twelve months, based on its low Price/Sales ratio. While many other stocks are growing faster, I can't say the same for many other stocks in the space.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2424155,58981,2014-08-14T15:17:45-04:00,"Groupon stock fell 15% last week when revenue missed by 1.5%.
        Improvements across most operating sectors bode well.
        Could there be a renewed ""romance"" between Groupon and Google?","Recently Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) released its latest earning results and missed expected revenues by 1.5%. However, ""Mr. Market"" reacted strongly and the run-up of the past few days quickly reversed and GRPN fell 15%. The stock fell below $6 a share and has since settled into a new range just under that mark. This is not new-almost every quarter Groupon's estimated revenue and return to profitability are forecast, the stock heads up and often even bounces just before the earnings release. This quarter was no exception-Groupon ran up from $6.40 to just over $7 in the last two trading days before the results were released.I will honestly admit I have been negative about Groupon in the past but that was when the stock was trading as much as twice as high as it is now. When some of this froth was removed (sometimes after previous quarterly earning ""misses"") I have established a modest position. My rationale for this was the large cash stockpile the company maintains and improving results across business sectors that should lead to modest earnings for 2014 and continued profitability into 2015. I personal used both dollar-cost averaging and a covered call strategy to reduce my cost per share over time. While on paper I am down on about 1/3 of my shares over-all my strategy has me breaking even after the recent drop.Other than price, why have I now become a cautious bull on Groupon? I'll point out a few reasons and link to a fellow analysts who have shaped my views instead of simply paraphrasing their arguments.First: Overblown responses to inflated estimatesThis quarter's stock action shouldn't have come as a surprise to those who have either held Groupon or watched it long-term. Most quarters estimates and predictions are rosy and target prices for the stock rise, and quite often the stock follows suit. I have already discussed what happened in early August. Looking back in May and February we see a similar pattern. Early May trading saw the stock fall even further than recently and set a new 52 week low after earnings were released May 6th. In February, the drop was 20%: from over $10 to just over $8. While price movement alone shouldn't drive an investor's decision, wise purchases when predictable disruptions occur can enable positions to be initiated or increased more favorably. If other factors remain the same, Groupon just went ""on sale"" as it seems to do every quarter. The stock spiked up for a few days and then dropped back down-well timed purchases or sells of the stock or covered calls on a fairly predictable pattern can't be counted on as a fool-proof strategy forever but seem to be the trend in Groupon.Second: International strategies starting to pay offOne of my issues with Groupon has been how quickly the stock went up when it was simply a daily deal site in the U.S. Those days are over as Groupon has diversified, but the stock remained highly inflated with little earnings as leadership changed, the business was expanded and diversified both domestically and with international purchases and expansion. Additionally, the company strategically deployed the cash war chest from the IPO and bought leading international brands that made sense from a similar market perspective. While still highly valued for current earnings per share, what I considered ""irrational exuberance"" of the early days has blown off. Previous purchases are being integrated into the company, and consistent stock buybacks are also being used to limit shares outstanding. Last quarter overall revenue rose 23%, with Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA in results) -were up 42% and Rest of the World up 40%. These are good signs, and point out to the overblown nature of a 15% sell-off.Third: Could there be a re-kindled ""romance"" between Google and Groupon?SA contributor Bob Ciura does a great job stating the case for a renewed discussion between Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Groupon in his recent article. I would recommend anyone long either stock read his article. To personalize two corporations, Google should act like a mature lover and make another attempt to woo Groupon, and Groupon should consider the strengths of their suitor. One factor to consider is while Groupon has purchased both other companies (Ideelli, travel app Blink, SideTour, and Korean ecommerce leader Ticket Monster are some recent examples) and bought back 17.2m shares of stock with a remaining $118m on the current authorization, the company still maintains $1.30 in cash per share. This would immediately offset any acquiring company's cost. Even more importantly, a costly price war wouldn't benefit either company and likely open the door for other competitors-which Bob highlights in his article. I could expect a merger or at a minimum a partnership being considered over the next few quarters. Is a merger or partnership required for Groupon's survival? No, but there would be benefits to both companies. This would likely raise Groupon's value 25-33% quickly and still leave the stock at a discount to Google's previous offer.So where do we go from here?With management's efforts of the past two years starting to pay off and small profitable earnings being shown, Groupon could be on the verge of breaking into sustained profitability. A quarterly pattern of rising trading prices and volumes then a sudden drop when positive but realistic revenues are reported has happened yet again. While I am still cautious and do not have a substantial percentage of my funds invested in Groupon, I have changed from an incredulous spectator to a ""long"". Groupon occupies one of the ""high risk"" positions in my portfolio. I leave long-term estimates to other analysts but think a sustained increase in the stock price should occur once consistent profits are reported and the conditions seem to be in place. The kicker as Bob Ciura points out could be an offer by Google at a modest premium but still at a discount to the $6B purchase offer previously made. In either case Groupon could be a positive, successful trade after the recent over-reaction to a minor revenue miss.Note: Nothing in this article should be construed to be an offer to buy or sell securities.

        Groupon's strategies look sound, and could help it reduce expenses and improve the bottom line going forward.
        Groupon's focus on mobile and new products can be catalysts in the long run.
        Groupon's strong cash position and earnings growth expectations make it an enticing bet at 52-week lows.","Daily deals company Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) performance has gone from bad to worse this year. The stock has taken a massive beating in 2014, declining close to 50%. In addition, Groupon's recent second-quarter results were not up to the mark either, as its loss widened year over year even though it reported a massive jump in revenue.As a result of Groupon's growing losses, investors seem to be losing confidence in the stock, and it is no surprise that the stock is currently trading near its 52-week low. However, since Groupon is investing for the future, investors should not get disheartened. Its strategies seem to be reaping results, as Groupon reported a 23% increase in revenue to $751.6 million in the second quarter.Moreover, management is determined to turn around the current situation. It is working on transforming Groupon into an e-commerce company.How management plans to deliver growthTo boost growth, management is working on three objectives. The first objective is to reaccelerate local growth in North America, as well as abroad. According to the company, people are showing willingness to buy more products. Consequently, its billings during the quarter improved after declining for two consecutive quarters. Groupon expects the same trend to continue in the coming months, and therefore, it remains on track to deliver double digit year-over-year billings growth in North America this year.Second, it aims to improve its margins, especially in North America. For quite some time, Groupon's expenses have almost doubled compared. Consequently, it has made strategic changes to counter this problem, which includes shifting most of its business to a drop ship platform, moving more fulfillment to its own distribution center in Kentucky, and increasing units per order. As a result of these changes, it expects margins to improve going forward.Lastly, Groupon is focused on improving its international operations and reduce losses globally. It has made progress in this direction, as its growth in the Asia Pacific was one of the key reasons behind a 145% jump in billings in the rest of world segment last quarter.Investing in mobileGroupon is also seeing good traction in its mobile segment. In fact, the company is trying to become a predominantly mobile business. According to statistical data, around 92 million people have downloaded its app, and reports reveal that it has become the ""most mobile large-scale ecommerce company in the world."" Also, management is working on the convergence of Local and Mobile. Looking ahead, Groupon anticipates a world where all merchants and consumers are connected in real time. The main idea behind this is to make the Groupon experience ""seamless, frictionless, and fun.""Cleary, the company is making progress to improve its platform. At the same time, Groupon is enhancing its product portfolio that will allow merchants to offer deals that vary based on both time of the day and day of the week. This will attract more merchants that previously couldn't work with Groupon.Groupon is launching two new products, namely Pages and Genome. Pages will create a web and mobile presence for every local merchant, providing valuable information like maps, time of service etc., to users. It has built pages for millions of merchants in North America, and expects the same to continue in the coming months. On the other hand, Genome is a new operating system for its merchants that will allow customers to redeem their Groupons without ever taking their phone out of their pocket.Going forward, these initiatives might fuel Groupon's growth. In a statement, management said, ""Our local mobile and marketplace investments together with Genome represent the culmination of years of hard work and significant investment, which we believe firmly positions us to realize our vision of connecting local commerce.""ConclusionThere is no doubt that Groupon is working toward growing the business aggressively. The company is working to make its platform better, apart from rolling out new products. Moreover, Groupon has secured a $250 million revolving line of credit, which will give it more resources to invest in the business. In addition, Groupon already has around $868 million in cash. In addition, over the next five years, it is estimated that Groupon's earnings will grow at a rate of 27% a year, so investors can consider using Groupon's weak performance in 2014 as a buying opportunity.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The acquisition has sparked merger interest in several other local focused online players such as Yelp. Recently, analysts have also been speculating the possibility that daily deals site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) could be a possible take-over target and that someone like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) may be interested in buying it to beef up their Google Offers service.Groupon's FinancialsGroupon's Second quarter revenues grew 23% over the year to $751.6 million, falling short of the market's expectations of $762 million. During the quarter, gross billings increased 29% to $1.82 billion as they saw a 26% increase in Groupon Goods and a 44% increase in travel sales. EPS of $0.01 was in line with the Street's projections for the quarter.By region, revenues from North America reported the slowest growth at 12% over the year.

Mobile usage has improved with mobile devices accounting for nearly 50% of the transactions worldwide. By the end of the quarter, they recorded over 92 million downloads of their mobile app.For the current quarter, Groupon forecast revenues of $720-$770 million with an EPS of $0.00-$0.02. The market was modeling revenues of $760 million with an EPS of $0.03. Groupon revised their EBITDA projections for the year downwards from $300 million to $270 million.Groupon's Product UpgradesGroupon plans to improve their e-commerce related offering through new services. Groupon realizes that despite the rising subscriber base, they are yet to make a big impact within the retail space. According to market reports, only 5% of the available merchants in the country use Groupon's services to sell their goods. As part of this emphasis, they are working on Groupon Pages and Genome.Groupon Pages will not only offer the customer access to retailers' offered Groupon discount, but also feature additional information like customer tips, operating hours, location, and maps. To simplify the payment process for customers and retailers, Groupon will be releasing a new operating system, Genome. Genome will enable merchants to identify customers who have Groupon coupons and let these customers pay using iPad mini. Using Genome, merchants will no longer require either a printed or a digital voucher to process the Groupon discount.Groupon's stock is trading at $6.17 with a market capitalization of $4.21 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $12.76 in September 2013. The stock recovered from the 52-week low of $5.18 that it had touched in May this year soon after the announcement of the Priceline and OpenTable deal.Two years back, Google offered $6 billion to acquire Groupon. Groupon, in its infinite hubris, had turned them down. Today, if Google made the same offer again, it is unlikely that shareholders will be so arrogant."
2395495,69695,2014-08-07T12:23:20-04:00,"Google offered to buy Groupon in 2010 for nearly $6 billion.Groupon rejected the offer, but its enterprise value is now just $3.7 billion.At a much more attractive price, and considering the strategic benefits remain, Google should make another offer.","Online coupon marketer Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) crashed 15% immediately after reporting earnings. Judging by its price action alone, you'd naturally assume there was little reason to be optimistic about the company. But underneath the scary stock decline is a company that is growing revenue and billings at fairly impressive rates. The company is steadily building its brand, both domestically and in new international markets.After reporting earnings three months ago, Groupon crashed in a similar fashion, then proceeded to steadily climb back. Now that the same post-earnings collapse is happening again, it once again offers an intriguing entry point. And Groupon looks attractive not just to individual investors, but perhaps a takeover candidate as well.Perhaps it's time for Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to kick the tires on Groupon once again and consider a buyout.Don't overreact to the stock dropWhen a stock opens 15% lower after reporting earnings, you know something has gone terribly wrong. In Groupon's case, investors appear to be panicking over revenue that came in a little lighter than analysts had anticipated.In all, revenue jumped 23% to $751 million, although this was less than the $761 million expected by analysts. Still, it's hard to see reason for such a sell-off with 23% revenue growth. It's not as if this is a shrinking business. Also, Groupon's gross billings hit a record last quarter.Geographically, Groupon is killing it internationally. While revenue from North America rose 12%, sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa soared 42%. Groupon's Rest of World segment posted stellar 40% revenue growth as well.Groupon's success in under-developed markets is a direct result of its acquisitions. Late last year, Groupon acquired LivingSocial Korea and its subsidiary Ticket Monster in January for $260 million in cash and Groupon stock.The deal was meant to expand Groupon's position internationally, and the results speak for themselves.Why Groupon would be a great fit for GoogleGroupon and Google are direct competitors. Google's Offers platform is a similar service, which allows users to instantly pull up offers on their phones and redeem them. Google is afforded an added luxury because its Offers service works in tandem with Google Maps and other applications to enhance the overall experience.As opposed to going to war and having to spend tons of money getting ahead of one another, it makes better sense for Groupon and Google to team up. This was presumably the rationale behind Google's pursuit of Groupon several years ago.You may recall that Google actually tried to buy Groupon once. According to several outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, Google offered to buy Groupon in 2010 for nearly $6 billion. Groupon rejected the offer, which obviously looks foolish in hindsight. But from Google's perspective, why not try again, now that Groupon's valuation is nearly $2 billion less than its offer four years ago?It stands to reason the same benefits Google saw from a partnership with Groupon still hold true today. The only difference is that Google can snatch up Groupon for less money. Even assuming a healthy 25% premium to Groupon's $3.8 billion enterprise value, Google will still be saving around $1 billion from its previous offer.Groupon's situation looks grim if you judge it solely by its stock price performance. But now that Groupon is at approximately $6 per share and a market capitalization of $4 billion, it's likely looking attractive once again to potential buyers.Google would benefit strategically from buying Groupon, and financially as well, since Groupon's shares have performed so poorly this year. Likely synergies from an acquisition could produce even more savings. When you consider the benefits versus the costs, it makes a lot of sense for Google to once again come back to the table.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Analysts were expecting $0.01 per share on $761.8 million of revenue. Although Groupon delivered with $0.01 per share, its revenue was light, reporting only $751.6 million. Moreover, the sell-off was fueled with tepid guidance given by management. Analysts previously were expecting Q3 EPS of $0.03 on revenue of $760.6 million, however, management has guided for EPS of $0.00 - $0.02 and revenue between $720 million and $770 million.Revenue for the quarter increased 23% y/y, however, it actually decreased from last quarter. Expenses rose during the quarter and despite the 23% y/y revenue increase, gross profit only rose by $5.2 million or 1.36% y/y. Furthermore, active customer growth has stagnated greatly. Although it increased 25% y/y, it only added 1.4 million customers or 2.7% during the quarter. The momentum in GRPN is clearly fleeting with a slew of competitors putting pressure on margins and staunching growth. Without any competitive advantage this trend will continue.In my previous article, ""Groupon Has An Unsustainable Business Model,"" I opined that rising expenses with decelerating revenue growth would prevent GRPN from justifying its lofty valuation. With a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion, quarterly revenue in the mid-$700 million range and declining, and an EPS just about break-even, Groupon faces a tough future ahead and will likely fall even further from current levels.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With the limitless potential of the Internet to drive growth and the initial hit with customers in search of daily deals, the stock was one of the most hyped IPOs in history. When Groupon went public in 2011 the stock traded around $26 per share. After missing on revenue on its Q2 2014 earnings, the stock burned liked kindling, falling 16% after-hours. As of Wednesday's closing price of $5.86 per share, the stock is down 17% (1.21) off its pre-earnings price of $7.07. Based on the company's deteriorating operating leverage, the stock has further room to fall. Below are the company's historical operating results:EarningsLacks Scale of ebay and AmazonGroupon's original strategy was to reach customers via daily email blasts. That appeared to be more of a shotgun approach - reaching out to the universe in hopes of yielding enough customers to make the marketing plan cost effective. The company is now employing more of a ""demand pull"" strategy where it tries to attract customers to its website in search for deals. That said, Groupon is selling more goods ""directly"" and has set up its own distribution center in Kentucky. It plans to compete in the ecommerce space with eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).Generating leads via direct sales may be more cost effective than email blasts, but can the company make money doing it? According to the company, its costs are about 2x that of competing ecommerce competitors:One way of bringing margins in line with other ecommerce companies is by cutting costs. The other way is by growing revenues. For instance, trailing 12 months revenue for eBay and Amazon were $17 billion and $82 billion, respectively. That morphs Groupon's run-rate revenue of about $3B. That said, the company must grow revenue to attain the necessary scale to make direct sales and making its own distribution center a profitable proposition.ConclusionGroupon is trying to morph into an ecommerce company on par with eBay and Amazon. In doing so, its gross margins and profitability have declined. The company lacks the necessary scale to compete in the ecommerce space. I advise investors to sell the stock until Groupon attains that scale, if at all.Disclosure: The author is short GRPN. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

        Option traders are betting on a 19% price move following the release.
        The online coupon cutter should report a profit, but I'm remain skeptical.","Background: Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) operates as a local commerce marketplace selling coupons and offering products for sale. The market cap is $4.4 billion, and on any given day the company trades about 15 million shares.Groupon is forecast to record lower second-quarter earnings after the market closes on August 5, 2014. The consensus estimate is currently a profit of 1 cent a share, a drop of 1 cent from 2 cents during the equivalent quarter last year. Revenue is expected to expand about $24 million sequentially and over $155 million during the same period last year to reach $762 million.I've read estimates ranging from a loss of 3 cents to as high as a profit of 3 cents per share. So that tells you how much consensus there is.   The whisper numbers I have examined start at 1 cent and go up to 6 cents. As large of a year-over-year gain analysts are predicting, Groupon will still need to beat and guide higher to push the share price materially higher.Compared to Groupon's 25.9 forward price-to-earnings ratio, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) has a P/E of 35.97. I have a neutral stance with Facebook (up from my Sell opinion at the IPO), but remain bearish on Groupon.I made a purchase (bought a bulk pack of batteries because with three young sons, we use a lot of them) that included AA and AAA. Each type arrived via UPS (NYSE:UPS) quickly, but shipped on the same day, albeit in separate packages. Because they weren't shipped together, the effective shipping cost was about double.As a customer, I don't care, but from an investor point of view, I want to know if that's standard, or if my order was a unique situation.Yahoo! Finance (YHOO) states Groupon has a Beta of 0.67. I'm having a hard time getting my head wrapped around such a small number for a stock that appears to move with considerable volatility. I think its number is incorrect, or at least misleading from a practical point of view.Beta describes volatility for a stock. The lower the number, the less historical amount of volatility the shares have demonstrated. 1 is the market average, 2 is double and 0.5 is half the average.Shareholders have not been rewarded for their patience; shares have fallen a crushing 27% in the last year. All while other investors have enjoyed significant appreciation in the overall market. If a rising tide lifts all boats, one has to wonder what a falling market will do to Groupon.The average analyst target price for Groupon is $8.58. If the company can deliver, and continue to deliver, that's a reachable goal. Otherwise, business as usual isn't going to get there in my opinion.I check option pricing on calls and puts to know what the market is expecting after-earnings price range. The higher the premium, the more investors are bracing for a major price move (not limited to earnings, implied volatility always measures expected price change within a given time frame). You want to examine the next expiration date after the earnings release and maybe one later date.Based on current option premium, investors and traders are wagering on a 19%, or about $1.24 move in the next 7 days.That means, as a shareholder or potential investor, you should anticipate Groupon to trade as low as $5.23, or appreciate higher to $7.71, and still remain within one standard deviation. If you're not already prepared for such a broad move (and there's no guarantee it won't move beyond the expected range), you want to make the necessary adjustments.After last quarter's results, the shares decreased an incredible 22.6%, or $1.56 from the close before earnings release to the closing after. The final price preceding the report was $6.89, and concluded at $5.33 the next trading session.Groupon shares dropped a humble 6.1% from the closing before last quarter's release until now. That means, based on last quarter's results, and the current option premium charged, as expensive as the options are, it's more advantageous to BUY premium instead of selling it.Of course, it's akin to driving by using the rear-view mirror, and the implied volatility is sky high for the expiration date immediately after the report. My preference is to sell premium unless it's a day trade or a special situation (if I want to short a stock that I can't find borrows).The short interest is anything, but short. The number of shares shorted is markedly elevated and should be treated as warning that shorts anticipate continued price weakness. The current float short is 19.4%.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Be prepared to stay for the long-haul.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported-$0.03 in EPS and $752m (+23% y/y) in revenue both of which fell short of the $0.01 in consensus EPS and $762m in consensus revenue. Gross billing growth of +29% y/y suggests that commission rates have declined in the quarter. Despite the increasing number of deals, improvements in average spend per customer and the increased number of active customers (53m and counting), the declining commission rate indicates that the competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other group-buy sites is heating up, and that sacrificing commission to retain relevant deals may be necessary to attract the users. That said, the transitioning from pull to push model will take longer than previously expected and investors who still have faith in the company should be prepared to be here for the long haul. With the stock down 15% after hours, I am not ready to pull the plug yet and see the current level an attractive buying opportunity as operating metrics have shown sequential improvement, which I believe could translate to improvement in the financial metrics. Reiterating my cautious but positively-biased view.Not bad as it seemsThe headline number is indeed worrisome as the 29% billing growth and 23% revenue growth indicated commission erosion in the face of heightening competitive pressure from competing sites. The company also opened a $250 three-year revolver, which could further lever up the balance sheet. Finally, revenue guidance of $720-770m was in the low-end of the consensus $760m, reflecting on the ongoing growth challenges that GRPN may face.Looking at the geographic regions separately, North America billing and revenue growth of 12% suggests that commission rate is stable over the Q. EMEA's 0.2% billing growth but 42% revenue growth was also positive. The culprit of the headline number is the 145% growth in billing for the rest of the world and its 40% revenue growth. The higher billing growth was due to the acquisition of TMON. When TMON is excluded, billing grew 17% y/y, which puts GRPN's ROW unit on track to generate positive operating income in Q4. As matter of fact, operating income margin in all three key geographic regions improved sequentially, indicating disciplined cost control.While the revenue outlook was in the low-end of the consensus, adjusted EBITDA for the full-year is expected to exceed $270m compared with the prior guidance of $50-70m. I believe this will likely to be a result of better cost control and maybe a positive surprise on the revenue side.The positives are in the operating resultsOperating results continue to move towards the right direction and could move the financial metrics once a critical mass is achieved. I note that the number of active users grew 22% y/y to 53m driven by North America (+43% y/y) and rest of the world (+30% y/y), which indicates solid growth in popularity involving Groupon.Average spend per customer also seen solid growth, in particularly outside of North America and EMEA where growth was up 10% y/y and rebounded 22% q/q. However, North America continue to see average spend decline and I suspect the ongoing transition towards mobile and the shift from push to pull business model may have impacted the users' purchasing behavior.Total deal inventory expanded to 240k with 105k in North America and the number of vouchers sold grew 79% y/y to 83m units, driven largely by TMON acquisition. Nonetheless, it is positive to see that 1) demand is still trending nicely despite the lower commission rates, 2) user growth indicates GRPN's popularity continues to remain robust and 3) global average spend per customer growth indicates a rising number of relevant deals in GRPN's inventory.Be prepared for the long haulGroupon's transition from push to pull model is critical as it ensures that the company stay relevant going forward. While the company has greatly expanded its deals volume over the past years, I believe that there is still a lot of work to do in terms of expanding local deals so that the users can proactively search on GRPN for deals around their location. If GRPN expands the deal inventory by including frequently visited places, I believe that we could see an acceleration in revenue and rebound in commission rates as GRPN is a critical channel for these businesses to get rid of excess inventory to cover a fixed cost (ie. movie theater). The pull-model has worked extremely well in Asia, where people frequented local deals in popular restaurants, café and/or movie theaters. I believe that GRPN can also deliver the same result once the deal inventory is expanded further with a particular emphasis on local and goods, but this expansion could take a while.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:GRPN) is slated to report 2Q 2014 earnings after the bell on Tuesday, August 5th. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST followed at 5:00 p.m. with a webcast presentation available through Groupon Investor Relations. Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount worldwide.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSince the IPO stock price $25 high in 2011, the stock declined to around $3 in 2012, had a 50% retracement of the decline in 2013, and now has retraced half of last year's rebound in 2014. So, what appears to have an overpriced IPO has been corrected by the market and we should be at a more realistic valuation. The current balance is $6.25 to $6.75, so a positive reaction to the earnings report would run into resistance at the late February/early March consolidation area at around $8.50 where the 200-day moving average is also located. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryGroupon is going through a transformation that is expected to weigh on profit margins in the near-term, so expectations are relatively low despite the company having beaten analysts' consensus by increasing amounts the last four quarters. Consensus has been reduced from 3c three months ago, but reporting above estimates would be a positive. If the company can report at the high end of guidance at 2c on revenue of at least $767 mln, traders would be encouraged and could then direct more attention to gross billings and next quarter's guidance.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

        Groupon is aggressively making investments to improve its services to deliver long-term growth.
        With new services such as Groupon Basics, the company is attracting more customers.
        Groupon's focus on technology improvements should further improve its performance.","Although shares of daily deals site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) are down more than 45% in 2014, a closer look at the company's fundamentals, balance sheet, and terrific growth make it an enticing prospect. Groupon is posting rapid growth in revenue, and its user metrics are also growing at a robust pace. For example, in the first quarter, its gross billings increased about 29% year over year to $1.82 billion. Also, its mobile business saw solid adoption, as more than 10 million applications were downloaded during the first quarter, while its mobile revenue grew to 54% of the overall business.Impressive fundamentalsWhile these moves look impressive, Groupon's valuation and balance sheet make it even more attractive. Since Groupon is still incurring a loss on a GAAP basis, it doesn't have a trailing P/E metric. However, its forward P/E looks impressive at 25, especially considering that its bottom line is expected to improve at an annual run rate of 27% for the next five years. Additionally, its sales are expected to grow at a tremendous rate as well, with analysts expecting growth of 24% in the current fiscal year.On the other hand, Groupon has a rock-solid balance sheet. It doesn't have any debt, and its cash position is strong at $1.04 billion. In addition, Groupon's cash flow generation also looks impressive. In the past year, the company has generated $189 million in operating cash flow and $250 million in levered cash flow.Quite clearly, Groupon's fundamentals are quite strong, and coupled with the company's smart business strategies, it could be a good buy on the pullback.Aggressive growth movesGroupon is making aggressive investments in marketing and order discounts in local and international businesses. This is why the company's adjusted EBITDA in the previous quarter was down on an year-over-year basis. But, these investments are expected to deliver long-term growth, and aid the company's revenue improvement.Groupon is concentrating on three aspects to improve its performance. It is looking to accelerate its local growth in North America and abroad, improve the gross margin and operational efficiency of its goods business, and achieve stability in its international operations. In addition, the company is trying to provide better service through initiatives such as drop shipping, increasing unit per order, changing its free shipping threshold from $19.99 to $24.99, and shifting more fulfillments to its own distribution center in Kentucky.Attracting more customersBesides, Groupon has also started selling other consumer goods in bulk through its e-commerce platform. Also, its new service Groupon Basics is driving growth as it allows the consumer to stock up more than 100 household, personal care, health and wellness, and grocery items. As reported on Engadget:Moves such as these should help Groupon to bring more shoppers into its fold, which will ultimately lead to growth in its advertiser base. Moreover, Groupon expects its billing growth to touch 25% this year driven by such initiatives.In addition, Groupon continues to offer discounts to attract consumers and to expand its sales. It has also started offering in-store coupons from national retailers such as Macy's (NYSE:M) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS). Also, it has started running TV commercials in its top six markets, including Atlanta and San Francisco, to make consumers aware of its services when they want to buy anything, anytime, and anywhere with added service offerings such as product sales and payments services.Improving its technologyFurthermore, Groupon recently completed the acquisition of South Korean e-commerce marketplace, Ticket Monster, which should help the company to boost its sales on the e-commerce platform where it plans to sell its products in bulk. Groupon has also opened back-office infrastructure in many small countries, which are expected to be regionalized in a couple of years. This should increase its operational efficiency and reduce its SG&A expenses.In addition to its focus on building a Local marketplace, Groupon also anticipates significant growth opportunities in its core e-mail business. Groupon currently sends over 250 million e-mails every day to its subscribers. The company will continue to innovate on its push business throughout 2014 by introducing technology like its new widget-based e-mail system called Mindstorm, which will make what customers see in their e-mails more relevant and personalized.ConclusionTaking a look at Groupon's various initiatives, it is not surprising to see why its bottom line is expected to grow at a robust pace going forward. The company is making solid improvements in mobile, while its acquisitions should allow it to bring in new technology into the business. Groupon is also focusing on product innovation. As a result of its impressive strategies, investors should think of capitalizing on Groupon's weak performance and buy some shares.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Despite the share weakness, I believe that the turnaround story is on track driven by international expansion and margin expansion. While North America local billing is expected to be flat y/y in the upcoming Q, solid execution and the transition from push to pull model is likely to accelerate growth to reach double digit by year-end.North America turning the corner? Soon…North America billing remained weak in Q1 with 1% growth in billings, well under the 3% expected of the consensus. As the company transition from its traditional pushed to pulled approach, billings in North America could remain weak so a flat y/y growth in the June quarter seems to be reasonable. However, growth could accelerate once again in the 2H via both organic recovery and M&A.The organic recovery will come from offering GRPN's users a broader selection of deals and moving towards the pull model. My recent checks on GRPN websites involving 5 major cities (New York, LA, Chicago, Toronto, Vancouver) suggest that deal count has been ramping up nicely and that the increase in getaways and goods is a good way to attract and encourage users to frequently check the main site for any ongoing deals which is accretive to the pull-model.M&A growth will come from consolidating the fragmented industry to gain greater scale and reach. GRPN's recent acquisition of Canada's SnapSaves is a sound strategic move, in my view, as the company can penetrate the local grocery space and provide its users with more attractive deals.Positive on international expansionBesides the gradual recovery in North America, I am also positive on Groupon's international expansion as the company increases the deal density, expand merchant network and create a comprehensive group-buy/ecommerce platform. I believe that the recent acquisition of Ticket Monster in Korea and Ideeli are constructive to GRPN's international footprint but I am also keeping an eye on the local competitors as they typically have an advantage over GRPN in terms of merchant relationship.In conclusion, investors should expect North America recovery to be on track while international continues to grow in terms of users. At 62x this year's earnings, the stock is expensive but it is better to be constructive on any weakness in shares.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2311155,67473,2014-07-11T15:16:33-04:00,,"By Michael IdeSentiment may be turning for Groupon, but some analysts are still unconvinced it will ever be profitableWhen Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) first went public at $20 per share, it was the latest example of an overhyped tech stock for prudent investors to avoid, and sure enough, it fell by 90% in its first year. But since then its revenues have continued to grow and sentiment has pushed its stock price from sub-$3 lows to more than $12 at the beginning of the year, and pulled it back down to $6.60. While some analysts see this as an attractive entry point, others doubt that its revenue growth will ever show up as an actual profit.Revenue hasn't yet translated into profitabilityGroupon Inc.'s revenue has grown 26% year-on-year, but because its gross margins continue to fall (84% at the IPO to 51% now), that revenue translates to just 2% higher gross profits. The problem is that Groupon's business model just isn't that hard to duplicate, and even though it's still at the top of its niche, its daily deal sites continue to proliferate, putting even more pressure on margins.Himelson acknowledges that there are some possible catalysts to boost profits, but he doesn't find any of them particularly convincing. The growth of mobile computing has improved the size of the daily deal market in general, and Groupon Inc. has been aggressively expanding internationally, but neither of these positive developments matter unless Groupon can stabilize its margins. Groupon has also launched a point-of-sale system called Gnome, but it will have to prove that it can steal market share from established POS brands like Square before investors make Gnome a significant part of their long thesis.Groupon could be an acquisition targetWith such a negative view of the company, you might expect Himelson to recommend shorting Groupon Inc., but the possibility that another company will acquire Groupon holds him back. While he has no faith in Groupon as a standalone company, someone else might be able to capitalize on its strong brand name and platform to drive customers toward more profitable offerings. And if Groupon's stock price gets low enough, the possibility of someone else acquiring it could become a long thesis of its own.Sign up for our free daily newsletterDisclosure: None"

The stock had been on a downward trend since the start of the year - however, since May, it looks like the stock has established a range - Groupon has been trading between $5-6.5 over the last six weeks. The company has been trying hard to increase its revenues, to some extent, Groupon has been successful in its efforts, but the increase has not been enough to turn the business to profitability. In this article, we will discuss the company's current financial position, its fresh competition, and where it is headed. Further, we will look into a few interesting moves by the insiders.Priceline increases CompetitionAlthough the stocks of both Groupon and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) surged after Priceline (PCLN) announced its acquisition of OpenTable, it is a threat to the companies rather than an opportunity. OpenTable is an online restaurant reservation business, which would complement the existing business of Priceline. Groupon, on the other hand, has its own restaurant reservation service called Groupon Serve. This poses a threat to Groupon's existing market share since Priceline now has a complete hotel business package and can offer people a complete service.Improving FundamentalsGroupon is spending heavily in order to market its service despite the operating losses. Fortunately, this seems to be paying off since its gross billings showed a robust increase of 29% in the first quarter of 2014. This led to 26% increase in revenues representing a remarkable progress. However, the profitability of the company is still in question which only increased by 2% in the first quarter.A good thing to be noted in its quarterly financials is that its customers who actually spend on the website are now 9% as compared to those who spend very little or simply surf. It has also managed to reach 200,000 average active deals in North America. Its app is playing an important role in bringing in more business. 54% of its global transactions were made through mobile devices. This percentage has been increasing rapidly which is also demonstrated in the following table.Source: First Quarter Earnings PresentationThe company expects its revenues for the second quarter to range from $725 million and $775 million with a positive EBITDA of $45 and 65$ -- EBITDA for the full year is expected to be more than $300 million. Even hitting a positive EBITDA is a milestone for the company, as it has no major interest costs. This means more of its EBITDA will make up for its net profit margin.Transactions by InsidersOn 13th June, the CEO, CAO and the director of the company sold a significant amount of shares compared to what they held in the first place. The CEO, Eric P. Lefkofsky sold 454,166 shares at an average price of $6.16 and now owns only 31,455 directly. The CAO of Groupon, Brian Steven sold 9,406 shares on the same day at a price of $6.30 per share, and currently owns 4,198 shares. Lastly, the director, Theodore Leonsis sold 19,750 shares at an average price of $6.22 and now owns 810,296 shares. The ratio of the transactions by insiders has been high on the selling side for Groupon over the last few months, and these recent transactions further add to the ratio. Moreover, these transactions create doubt in the minds of the investors about the future of the company as these sales are substantial.Focusing on the Local BusinessesThe company is focusing on the local businesses in order to increase its revenue growth. In order to increase the presence in the local businesses, the company will have to increase its sales staff and invest more on the sales team. As a result, the operating expenses will increase over the next few months. In order to be profitable, the company will need to grow revenue at a higher pace than its expense on the sales efforts. Otherwise, we might see Groupon's profitability suffer over the next two-three quarters.ConclusionThe trend in the price over the last six months has made Groupon an attractively priced stock. The company continues to focus on the long-term revenue growth and the focus on the local businesses will allow Groupon to enhance its revenues. Furthermore, the increase in bookings, spending on the website and the use of the mobile app shows that the company is on the right track, and the current price gives an attractive entry point.Additional Disclosure: This article is for educational purposes only and it should not be taken as an investment recommendation.

2273543,23479,2014-06-17T17:26:13-04:00,The increased demand for the stock can be attributed to the perception that the acquisition is an acknowledgement of value in structured location based businesses.The company sends 250 million emails everyday to its subscribers and this has helped it push upfront sales of groupons.We believe that Groupon will not seek a buyer if it is able to turn around its business.,"Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares saw a mild rise of 4% following the announcement of OpenTable’s (NASDAQ:OPEN) acquisition by Priceline (PCLN). The increased demand for the stock can be attributed to the perception that the acquisition is an acknowledgement of value in structured location based businesses. Groupon certainly falls into this category. The company has pioneered local deals business and continues to grow its merchant base. In fact, it has outlined focusing on ‘local’ as one of the three key strategies it will employ to revive faltering sales. That means significant investment in the sales team that will reach out to more local businesses, including retailers, restaurants, spas and travel agencies. Although there may be suitable buyers who will benefit from Groupon’s vast database of local merchants, the company needs to fix fundamental deficiencies in its business before it can market itself as an attractive acquisition target. Having said that, we believe that Groupon will not seek a buyer if it is able to turn around its business. Instead, it will leverage its dominant market position to expand both in the U.S. and overseas.Our price estimate for Groupon stands at $6.38 implying a slight premium to the market price.Groupon Needs To Fix Its Email System The blast e-mail of numerous offers to its customer base has been questioned for some time. Even though the company is trying to address this issue, there are still far too many irrelevant emails being sent by Groupon to its subscribers everyday. This has hurt its brand image and has diluted the value proposition. It would make much more sense to send fewer emails with a targeted list of deals that a customer is more likely to buy and redeem.The company sends 250 million emails everyday to its subscribers and this has helped it push upfront sales of groupons. A lot of these groupons tend to expire before a customer has a chance to redeem them. The average number of unused Groupons remained the same in the first quarter of 2014 following a decline throughout last year. This suggests that a lot of customers redeemed their unused and pending groupons in 2013 which may help the demand going forward. However, this also signals undesirable customer experience which will hinder the company’s organic growth. Having relevant deals with minimal upfront sales push is what may bring customers back to Groupon’s portal over and over.Groupon Needs To Encourage Users To Browse Groupon needs to ramp up its efforts to encourage subscribers to search for deals and explore its marketplace (‘pull’ strategy) instead of relying on emails (‘push’ strategy). It needs an image makeover, and accelerating such a subscriber shift will smooth out its topline growth and help reign in expenses. In March 2014, around 9% of Groupon’s traffic in North America comprised searches on its online marketplace. This implies that email related traffic still accounts for more than 90% of the company’s traffic. Given that Groupon has touted its ‘pull’ strategy for the last few quarters, its progress thus far appears to be a little disappointing. Customers who consciously search for deals tend to spend more and have shorter redemption cycles, which suggests that the company’s operations can get a significant boost if it can accelerate a customer shift from emails to its marketplace.Disclosure: No Positions"

The company's results have been outstanding of late as its service is gaining more traction. A look at Groupon's results clearly reveals why it will prove to be a good investment for the future, especially considering that it has lost 40% of its value so far this calendar year. Let's take a closer look at Groupon's results and see how it is positioned for the long run.Results are strongGroupon reported first-quarter revenue of $757.6 million, up 26% year-over-year, and beat the consensus estimate of $734 million. The company posted a loss of $0.04 per share for the quarter, while the consensus was for $0.07. The gross margin decreased from 63.0% to 50.9% in the quarter, while the adjusted earnings were $40.3 million, as compared to $71.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The operating expenses increased 12.9% year over year to $403.9 million, while gross billings came in at $1.82 billion, up 29% year-over-year.Groupon expects its second-quarter revenue to come in between $725 million and $775 million, while adjusted earnings are expected between a breakeven and $0.02 per share. The company expects EBITDA in the range of $45 to $65 million for the quarter, while for the full fiscal 2014, it is expected to be $300 million.Strong growth in key metricsThe company's active customers increased 24% year over year in the previous quarter to 51.8 million, consisting of 21.8 million in North America, 14.5 million in EMEA, and 15.5 million in the rest of the world. Groupon has been doing very well in its mobile segment. More than 10 million people went on to download Groupon's mobile app during the quarter, taking total app downloads to over 80 million. Regarding transactions, its global mobile business grew over 400 basis points to 54%. Groupon added approximately 6.9 million mobile customers globally in the first quarter.Acquisition targetFollowing the acquisition of OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) by Priceline (PCLN), investors have started to hope that an acquisition is in cards for the likes of Yelp and Groupon. While I don't think any company will acquire Yelp, because of its overly-inflated valuation, I do believe Groupon is a realistic acquisition target for the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Groupon's shares have performed horribly in the past few months. The company has lost half its value and this might just be the ideal time for Google to acquire Groupon on a cut-price valuation. With a P/S ratio of just over 1.6, Groupon is fairly cheap, and it will not have much problem integrating it into its Google Offers business, which is Groupon's direct competitor. This deal would be a win-win situation for both the companies as it will give rise to cost synergies, which the companies would otherwise spend on outdoing each other.Better than othersGroupon has done tremendously well as compared to other online retailing giants. While Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) primary merchandise business grew by 27%, year over year and eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) enabled commerce volume increased by 24%, Groupon's goods business increased by more than 100%. Size differences aside, the very first thing that makes Groupon's turnaround a good bet is the company's faster growth against both Amazon and eBay.Groupon's daily deals that made the company all the more famous are likely to include a little help from the tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, Groupon now is trying to recover from the financial troubles that it has been experiencing lately, and its recently launched Gnome merchant software ecosystem could help it in that effort. Moreover, the company's strategy to leverage the attractive nature of the iPad Mini makes this service more evoking.Analyst upgradesPiper Jaffray's analyst Gene Munster recently reiterated a buy rating on Groupon and gave it a price target of $16. Munster said:Another firm that rates Groupon a buy is B. Riley. Groupon's shares has been inching up ever since B. Riley upgraded it from ""neutral"" to ""buy"" and gave it a price target of $9.50. B. Riley's analyst Sameet Sinha believes that Groupon's management can deliver on their promises and expects operational improvements to propel organic growth and margin expansion in the near future.ConclusionGroupon has a lot of positives to offer. It should continue growing as a result of its mobile moves and new features. The company has been doing well, and being down 40% this year, it might make for a good investment at depressed levels.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2310115,60151,2014-07-11T04:26:01-04:00,"Groupon was able to grow revenue 26% y/y, but only 2% for gross profit, as it faces a substantial margin decline.Gross margins have declined from 84%, at the time of the IPO, to 51% today. Management also warned of a further reduction.An unsustainable business model is evident with operating expenses outpacing gross profit growth, which is leading to these quarters of losses.","Recent Operating PerformanceThe ability to generate revenue growth is not under scrutiny for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). In Q1 of 2014, it was able to grow revenues 26% y/y. The reason for the selloff is because that growth was accompanied by a paltry gross profit increase of 2%. Investors are becoming worried that margin reductions will never allow that revenue growth to flow through to the bottom line. Further, operating expenses rose 14% y/y as the company invested more heavily in marketing and a more robust sales staff. The incremental gross profit coupled with substantial expense growth is what led to an unprofitable quarter, losing $35 million in total.Business Fundamentals Since IPOIn the three years since GRPN first became publicly traded, the business fundamentals have deteriorated and the stock price has subsequently fallen to the mid $6 level today, down from $20 at its IPO. The most prudent action taken by GRPN's management was timing an IPO well and cashing out while they could.Groupon was the first to enter the industry, however, they did not have a moat to keep competitors out. An influx of competitors such as Living Social, Open Table, which was recently purchased by Priceline (PCLN), LiveDeal, RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE), and daily deal sites such as Woot.com (owned by Amazon), and meh.com (founded by Woot's founder) have compressed margins considerably. Since the IPO, gross margins have dropped from 84% to 51%.In the most recent 10Q filing management cited further margin deterioration being on the horizon:Source:10QShare DilutionIn the early days of the IPO, the stock received a pop, as the offer was quite limited. Only 35 million shares were offered with a total of 630 million shares outstanding. However, once lock-ups expired, the stock price fell precipitously. Moreover, investors since the IPO have experienced a significant dilutive effect, as management has increased shares outstanding by approximately 8%.Although management repurchased 3.1 million shares valued at $29.5 million, and has another $224 million remaining under the current authorization, it is not enough to overcome the dilution. Additionally, with losses still mounting, management may be wary to let go of its $1 billion of cash, so the positive effects of further share repurchases may never materialize.Hidden Costs On The HorizonThere are seemingly insignificant aspects of 10Qs that actually have an influential effect on the company's prospects. One such easily overlooked aspect is stock options. GRPN carries roughly 3 million options to purchase shares with a weighted-average price of $1.11. This results in an expense to management of $16 million when exercised. Further, management has a total of 40.5 million of restricted stock units, restricted stock, and ESPP shares. They have varying exercise prices, but certainly blunt the upside if management somehow is able to turn the business prospects around.Source:10QSource:10QHigh Operating ExpensesGroupon has attempted to increase its focus on local businesses. Without a good system of allowing businesses to create deals themselves, GRPN has relied on adding a larger sales staff in order to generate these sales. Operating with this model its not sustainable, as evidenced by the chart below. Their operating expense growth is far outpacing gross profit growth, which is the crux of the problem for Groupon. Unless it is able to create a system that enables customers to easily create deals for themselves, they will never become profitable. This business model clearly doesn't support a significant sales force.Possible Positive DevelopmentsMobileThe ubiquitous prevalence of mobile on society is apparent. Therefore, for internet-based business, it is integral for them to successfully convert their business to this platform. Groupon's mobile strategy has prospered and in March of 2014, mobile transactions accounted for 54% of total transactions. Moreover, during Q1 of 2014 10 million people worldwide downloaded their app, which brought total downloads to 80 million. Although this does mark a positive development and is a compelling figure for management to cite, it won't staunch margin deterioration.Source: Q1 2014 Earnings PresentationProduct AssortmentAt the time of the IPO in 2011, Groupon had around 1,000 active deals worldwide. Today, it has approximately 95,000 in North America, and over 200,000 worldwide. Another positive is that its active customer base rose to an all-time high of 51.8 million in the first quarter of 2014. Although a larger product assortment and active customer base is impressive, with no catalysts to drive margin expansion, these figures are not that important. The most salient implication of these figures is that it makes GRPN a more lucrative takeover target.Source: Q1 2014 Earnings PresentationGnome Point-Of-Sale SystemIt seems apparent that Groupon recognizes that it has no sustainable competitive advantage. An attempt to create one was the recent launch of Gnome, a point-of-sale (POS) system. Groupon will charge $10 a month for the Gnome iPad system and each transaction will charge 1.8% plus 15 cents a transaction for MasterCard and Visa purchases. This system is clearly designed not to be a money maker, but to attempt to spur businesses to join the platform and create more deals.Small businesses that Groupon caters to are notoriously slow to adopt new technology. Further, the Gnome is much less well known than competing point-of-sale systems such as Square. With no reviews of the system or real testimonies yet, small business owners will be skeptical of the system.Square was able to create a trusted brand with its simple credit card readers and then eventually rolled out an iPad POS system. I expect the effect of this system to be negligible on their results in the next few quarters and don't believe the system has a good likelihood of becoming that successful. However, they could prove me wrong and galvanize growth through this avenue, but I would not bet on it.Source: Groupon WebsiteFinal RemarksCompanies that have declined precipitously can sometimes create value opportunities. The adage buy when everyone is fearful and sell when others become greedy comes to mind. To determine if true value exists after a selloff, it is necessary to decide if the price reduction was warranted or not. Groupon is trading at around 1/3 of its IPO price, so it clearly fits the first criteria. However, with a deterioration of business fundamentals and no significant positive catalysts on the horizon, I do not view this company as a value opportunity.Nonetheless, I warn investors about shorting this stock. Although I truly believe that, as a stand-alone company, this business will eventually falter, it could be an acquisition target. A company could find value in integrating this platform into their offering such as was the case with OpenTable and Priceline. Therefore, shorting this company could be risky.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shares of the daily deals site have dropped more than 40%, as investors have focused more on its declining profits rather than tremendous revenue growth. As such, despite reporting a 26% increase in revenue in the first quarter, Groupon has failed to make a comeback. Its adjusted EBITDA of $40.3 million in the first quarter was lower than $71.9 million in the prior-year period. However, it cannot be denied that the company is making good progress.There's a possibility that Groupon can bounce back going forward, which is why it might be a good buy on the pullback. Let's take a closer look at Groupon's prospects and see why a turnaround is in sight.Smart strategiesGroupon has made good progress this year as far as the business is concerned. Its local marketplace has over 200,000 deals that are popular among customers. In addition, the mobile app of Groupon has helped it become a large-scale e-commerce company with a predominant mobile presence.The company has set three key objectives for 2014. First, it is looking to reaccelerate its local growth in North America and abroad. Second, it is trying to improve the gross margin and operating efficiency. Finally, Groupon is trying to achieve stability in its international operations and reduce its losses internationally to generate positive segment operating income by the end of the year. In addition, Groupon expects its North American local billings growth to multiply in the back half of this year as its marketplace continues to gain traction.Groupon is trying to change the perception about its business. The company is trying to project itself as not just a daily deals site, but a full marketplace that customers can access from anywhere, anytime. But, this transition has led to a minor slowdown in the business, although it places Groupon on the path for long-term growth. Moreover, the company is planning to regionalize its operations to reduce SG&A and improve operating efficiency.Terrific growth in mobileGroupon has made good progress as far as its key strategic initiatives are concerned. It saw tremendous mobile growth in the first quarter. In March, its global mobile business, in terms of transactions, grew over 400 basis points to 54%.Further, more than 10 million people downloaded its apps worldwide in the quarter, taking the total app downloads to over 80 million. Groupon added approximately 6.9 million mobile customers globally in the first quarter. Excluding acquisitions, the first quarter was one of its strongest customer activation quarters in over a year, with 1.3 million customers added.Improving the product portfolioGroupon has made substantial investments in point-of-sale and payment technologies in the last few years, and is providing its merchants with a suite of tools that connect them to its community of over 200 million subscribers and over 51 million active customers in 2014. The e-commerce company has built a marketplace, and has stocked its shelves with deals that its customers wish to buy when they are on the lookout for restaurants, spas, live events, hotels, products, and so on.The company now needs to enhance customer awareness and make sure that people check Groupon first while making buying decisions, so as to make Groupon an integral part of their daily lives. In order to achieve this, a complete re-engineering of the company is required from being singularly focused on daily deals.Groupon started integrating technology into the business to help it increase supply, while also bolstering the sales force that is now over 5,000 people strong. At the same time, Groupon is focused on attracting merchants to its platform.The company is also gaining traction with its core e-mail business, apart from being focused on building a local marketplace. It sends over 250 million e-mails every day to its subscribers. The company plans to continue innovating to push its business throughout 2014 by introducing technology like its new widget-based e-mail system called Mindstorm, that makes what customers see in their e-mails more relevant and personalized.Meanwhile, Groupon is also moving into newer areas. Groupon is working with SolarCity (OTCQX:SCTY) to offer deals on solar systems in the Groupon marketplace. This is expected to allow customers benefit from additional savings with a deal from Groupon by paying $1 for $400 off home solar power, for a limited time.Strong fundamentalsThus, on the back of such impressive moves, Groupon looks well-placed to turn its fortunes around, and a solid financial position and fundamentals will help it achieve the same. The important thing is that Groupon is debt-free, and a cash balance of $1 billion gives it the luxury to continue investing in various moves to continue improving.In addition, at a forward P/E ratio of 25, Groupon looks like a bargain, especially considering that its earnings are expected to grow at a terrific rate of 27% for the next five years. As such, investors should definitely consider Groupon for their portfolio, as it looks like a solid turnaround candidate.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2369645,56262,2014-08-01T09:37:20-04:00,Groupon is set to release earnings in the first week of August.The initiatives to boost its customer base will prove to be beneficial.Recent acquisition by Groupon will drive growth in the long run.The beaten down share price has made Groupon a great acquisition target.Groupon looks like a good buy.,"Having lost close to 45% of its market capitalization this year, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will be hoping for a turnaround when it reports its second-quarter results next week. But, should Groupon investors harbor any hopes of a turnaround? Let's find out.The expectationsAnalysts expect average earnings per share of $0.01, as compared to $0.02 per share in the same quarter last year. The average revenue estimate for the quarter is at $761.91 million, more than the previous year quarter's $608.75 million. This will be a massive jump of 25.20% year-over-year. So, it is clear that Groupon will be delivering solid revenue growth, but the bottom line performance is expected to be weak. However, since the company is making solid investments in the business, it can get better.Growth-oriented investmentsGroupon recently acquired Ticket Monster, a leading Korean e-commerce company, for $260 million in cash and stock. This acquisition will help Groupon expand overseas and strengthen its revenue growth. Ticket Monster comes with a user base of 4 million active customers and annual gross billings of $800 million. Moreover, Groupon will acquire a good grip over the fast growing e-commerce market of Korea.Groupon is planning on increasing its mobile presence by providing customers with a mobile based e-commerce platform. This measure is important as mobile service offerings are crucial growth drivers for the company. This is also a better option for making daily deal transactions, rather than the usual email-based mode. The mobile business is already doing good with more than 10 million application downloads in the first quarter, delivering 54% revenue growth in this segment.Groupon also announced the acquisition of Ideeli, a leading online flash fashion retailer, for $43 million in cash. Groupon plans to keep Ideeli running as a separate website. Ideeli has helped Groupon register its presence in the fashion market, allowing it to gain relationships with some key apparel brands. This acquisition supports Groupon's efforts to sell discounted merchandise, as Ideeli provides its customers with discounted women's and men's apparel and home decor. Groupon will also gain from Ideeli's mobile presence in the market, as well as its experience in flash-sale shopping.Growing the baseGroupon is increasing its advertiser base and gaining traction among shoppers with new services that offer discounts for those who shop in bulk. Groupon Basics is a bulk-shopping service that enables customers to stock up and save money on over 100 household, hygiene, and health products from companies like Gillette, Dove, Airborne, Pantene, and Burt's Bees. Ordering via this service will earn consumers a 5% incentive in Groupon Bucks to be used for future purchases. Also, if the purchase is above $24.99, the service offers free shipping and delivery.Groupon, in order to improve its performance, is adopting various strategies. It is focusing on its growth in North America and other foreign countries like Korea, trying to improve the gross margin and operational efficiency of its goods business.The company is offering discounts to attract consumers and to expand its sales. It has also increased its drop shipping threshold from $19.99 to $24.99. Groupon also offers in-store coupons from national retailers like Macy's (NYSE:M) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS). To improve advertising, the company is running TV commercials in its top six markets, trying to spread more and more awareness for its services among its consumers.With all the new initiatives and plans to build a local marketplace, the company is also looking forward to growth opportunities in its core e-mail business. At present, Groupon sends over 250 million e-mails every day to its subscribers. The company is working on an e-mail platform that will enable it to market categories of deals rather than just one per email, which lessens the number of irrelevant e-mails sent.Acquisition targetThe drop in Groupon's share price has also made it an ideal acquisition target. As I stated in my previous article:Strong fundamentalsGroupon stands strong on its balance sheet with $1.04 billion in cash and no debt. Additionally, Groupon's cash flow generation also looks impressive, as it generated $189 million in operating cash flow and $250 million in levered cash flow last year. Moreover, as mentioned above, Groupon looks like an acquisition target, which is why investors should definitely consider using the stock's drop to their advantage.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2269693,52932,2014-06-16T03:09:31-04:00,"Internet IPOs often endure a volatile introduction to the market and follow a unique experience but eventually settle and are judged by earnings like most stocks.Facebook and Glu Mobile are excellent examples of the potential upside as well as the pitfalls of the ""Internet Stock Life Cycle.""Groupon is currently in the middle of its life cycle and will either ascend to greatness or flounder, with little room in the middle.","There is a common misconception about the technology sector and the stock of some companies that operate within it, especially internet companies. Many investors view this cohort of stocks as erratic and closer to gambling than investing due to the excessive hype bestowed on these companies. Although the inaugural months of trading for internet stocks are exciting and volatile, they are not unpredictable as some may suggest. These stocks follow a different course early on but are eventually judged upon the same thing as all other sectors: earnings.The Internet Stock Life CycleThe different track of internet stocks begins the minute the IPO is priced, goes through a few successive stages, and then ends once investors focus on the company's income. All of the hype surrounding these companies tends to cause a big pop in share price immediately, shares then (eventually) plummet once the hype wears off and investors begin to speculate whether the stock has become ""too hot"" or is overvalued. Following this is a period where investors use the huge sell-off as opportunity to snag shares at what they believe is a bargain price; the stock price is usually range-bound for a little while during this time. Finally, the stock settles and is subsequently traded based on earnings as are companies across almost all other sectors. This point in the volatile early life of internet IPOs is a make or break time where stocks can become market darlings like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or become a dejected waste of potential like Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).The Internet IPO Life Cycle can be summarized below:Facebook and Glu are fantastic illustrations of the course internet IPOs follow and dramatic conclusion to this Life Cycle, both positively and negatively.FacebookFacebook's debacle of an IPO in May of 2012 is well documented and provided a major hiccup in the beginning of the company's publicly traded life as well as forcing the aforementioned Life Cycle to be delayed. Once the dust settled, Facebook shares followed the pattern.FB data by YChartsStarting on June 5th 2012, about three weeks after Facebook's IPO, the stock endured steps two and three which resulted in FB shares reaching their all-time low in the high teens. Facebook was range-bound for the next ten months while investors argued whether management would be able to monetize the popular social network or if it would join the long list of failed tech IPOs seen over the last two decades. The turning point in Facebook's short life as a public company was July 26th, 2013 when the company reported a fantastic quarter in which it posted earnings of $0.19/share vs. the expectation of $0.14/share. This earnings report and the outlook provided convinced investors that Facebook was the real deal and will be a very profitable company for years to come. FB's stock has soared and not looked back reaching its all-time high of $72.59 in March.FB data by YChartsThat earnings report in July of 2013 was an inflection point in Facebook's stock chart and there's no coincidence that as the share price continued to increase, so did earnings.As you can see Facebook is on track to soar above $1 in EPS for 2014, only its second full calendar year on the market. Yahoo! Finance's forward P/E of 35.95 and FB's closing price of $65.78 on June 11th yields an EPS estimate of roughly $1.83 for 2015. The ability of Facebook to monetize its platform and deliver concrete earnings instead of just hype and revenue growth as well as consistent earnings beats earned the company adoration from Wall Street. Facebook currently has 28 ""Strong Buy"" ratings from analyst firms.Glu MobileGlu Mobile is a publisher of mobile games available on smartphones and tablets similar to Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). GLUU had its IPO back in March of 2007 with shares' opening trading at a price of $11.50. After a slight decline in stock price, Glu followed the path of the Tech Stock Life Cycle but ended in a different place than that of Facebook. Stages two and three began in April 2007 and concluded in November of the same year when shares tumbled from their highs around $15 all the way down to $5.35 in just a few months.GLUU data by YChartsThe stock was then range-bound until August of the next year when the company reported another quarter of negative income. Despite setting a company record for revenue in Q2 2008, GLUU was still unable to reach profitability. This earnings report was the straw that broke the camel's back for investors. Wall Street was finally fed up with Glu's failure to profit from its mobile games. The stock plundered, becoming a penny stock for a while and not breaching the $2 level attained in November of 2010. Glu was unable to earn a profit in its first 13 quarters as a public company. The path of GLUU's stock was similar to that of Facebook's except in the final stage of its life cycle. At the end of all the hysteria that greets many internet IPOs, it is the bottom line that prevails as the ultimate determinant of the stock's trajectory, just like the rest of Wall Street.The characteristic that makes internet companies stand out from the rest of the technology sector, and most other sectors as a whole for that matter, is the hype stimulating them from the start. The media, investment firms, and activist investors are captivated by these companies and their stock which creates a certain aura about them and results in self-perpetuating discussion. The buzz surrounding internet IPOs may lay dormant for a period, (usually step four in the Life Cycle) but it does not disintegrate. Rather, the underlying energy combined with the anxious time spent waiting for the decisive distinction between profitability or inability is like a dormant volcano ready to erupt, and eventually it will. The fact that this hyperbolic level of hype is not only still present, but seemingly growing larger in the meantime is why the final move in share price is so drastic. So what does this have to do with Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)?Groupon, Inc. is currently in stage four of the Internet IPO Life Cycle, meaning that is only a matter of time before stage five begins and shareholders either make a bountiful profit or lose half of their investment in about an hour. Both GLUU and FB broke out of stage four within a 1 1/2 years of going public, GRPN had its IPO in late 2011. Groupon has managed to be marginally profitable in most of its quarters and excluding a slight surge in the latter half of 2013 (what stock didn't rally at some point last year?) has been range-bound for almost two years now. That crucial earnings report that determines the fate of internet companies is just around the corner for Groupon, but will it be closer to that of Facebook's Q2 2013 or Glu Mobile's Q2 2008?This past quarter, reported on May 6th, was almost Judgment Day for Groupon with shares tumbling 7% after a quarter that beat analyst expectations but still reported a loss of 1 cent per share. The stock rebounded in the following days to earn back about half the value lost on May 7th and now hovers around those same levels. The close call after last quarter leads me to believe that this upcoming quarterly report, estimated to be in early August, will be the quarter that determines GRPN's fate.GrowthQ1 2014 for Groupon was one characterized by growth. Revenue increased 26% and billings 29% year-over-year. The company's Rest of World sector saw billings accelerate 123%, largely due to the closing of its acquisition of Ticket Monster, a Korean ecommerce company, which was finalized on January 2nd. Ticket Monster, or TMON, reportedly has over $800 million in gross billings and ""consistently sees year-over-year billings growth in excess of 50%."" The problem with the growth generated by Groupon, is that it was not exclusive to revenue and billings. Total operating expenses increased 13.4% year-over-year leading to the company reporting negative EPS for the first time since Q4 2012. CEO Eric Lefkofsky even admitted on the Q1 Conference Call that GRPN has costs almost twice as high as other ecommerce companies.Major Changes at GrouponOne of Lefkofsky's core goals as CEO of Groupon is to reduce the high cost level of the business, his way of doing this is centered around the restructuring of GRPN's cost structure. He believes that the company has back office operations in far too many small nations and that these should be regionalized to maximize efficiency. The regionalization of these operations will take place over the next two years.Another one of the transitions underway at Groupon is the increasing shift to mobile, which has been moderately successful. This past quarter marked the first time that over 50% of total transactions completed were done via mobile. That signifies that Groupon is not ""becoming a predominantly mobile business"", but rather is now a predominantly mobile business, according to Lefkofsky. Groupon's mobile app was downloaded over 10 million times in Q1, bringing the tally to 80 million total downloads.Groupon is also altering the way it attracts customers. About a year ago, the company announced that it will change its marketing tactics from a ""Push"" strategy to a ""Pull"" strategy. The Push strategy is when a company essentially takes the product to the consumer. Groupon did this via e-mail alerts of certain deals and pop-up notifications on mobile devices. The Pull approach is more about letting the consumer come to the product. A large determinant of success for Pull Marketing are forms of buzz marketing. Word-of-mouth and social media interaction are major elements of this relatively young form of marketing. The idea is to make Groupon a part of each user's daily life. The same way many Facebook and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) users check their news feeds multiple times per day, GRPN's management is attempting to get its user base to check what deals are available before making any purchase. The company's increased mobile leverage should help this vision become a reality.Arguably most importantly, Groupon officially launched Gnome (Gee-Nome), a tablet-run platform for merchants to seamlessly recognize customers and their Groupons based on data collected, a few weeks ago. The technology will act as a point-of-sale system, a credit card processor, and will soon be compatible with Quickbooks and Xero to make it more favorable for small business owners to use. As further improvements are made, merchants will be able to ""run their entire operation"" through Gnome by allowing them to establish relationships with all customers as well as customize marketing strategies based on data trends collected by the hardware. Gnome is an integral part of Groupon's long-term goal of allowing merchants to always be connected to the Groupon marketplace. According to reports, GRPN has plans to require that merchants use Gnome in their businesses.RisksWhenever a company mandates that changes be made there are always inherent risks. What if the smaller countries whose back office operations are being shut down bloom into large profit driver for the firm in the future? Groupon would have to quickly expand its coverage in that area or face the potential problem of not meeting demand. Also, regionalizing operations could decrease the quality of customer service in that region and result in a loss of customers. Increasing mobile influence is the least risky of the changes being put in place, but there is still the chance that mobile users jump ship for the next big ecommerce app that comes out. The danger of the Pull strategy is pretty obvious: what do you do if users don't get ""pulled in""? There is the possibility that the Groupon app falls dramatically in popularity as users aren't inclined to check for deals constantly. The biggest liability, as well as the biggest potential success, is Gnome. If adopted by merchants, the platform could send Groupon to the forefront of small businesses from both the owner and consumer perspectives, a win-win. BUT, the rumored gutsy move of forcing merchants to employ the services of Gnome may not go over so well. If Gnome is not accepted and implemented by small business owners than the hardware, which is the crux of Groupon's long-term plan, will be a disaster and may very well take the company down with it.ConclusionInvestors considering Groupon as a part of their portfolio should focus on the future (as is commonplace), but not disregard the past. The company is following the Internet IPO Life Cycle same as Facebook and Glu Mobile and is about to break out similarly to one of those two divergent stocks. The potential growth is certainly there for Groupon, but time will be needed for its ventures to play out. The regionalization of its cost structures will not be completed for two years, meaning that the high expenses will continue in the interim and continue to pressure earnings. The Pull strategy is one that will, if successful, gradually work over time, and the Gnome is a borderline revolutionary platform for the company and the way it interacts with merchants but is still in its infancy. Usually, I am advocate for investing in potential if you are confident in the future prospects, but not in the case of Groupon. I don't think GRPN will deliver the earnings that the market has been anxiously awaiting for three years in a quick enough fashion. The hype and excitement created in the Internet IPO Life Cycle will cause Groupon's stock to collapse soon due to market impatience. The stock may be worth revisiting after its descent if the potential for growth is still there and the changes implemented by Lefkofsky start to show signs of progress.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2268263,66313,2014-06-13T15:21:03-04:00,Groupon's recent outlook accompanying their earnings release still reveals company's weaknesses going forward.Groupon's return on equity and net operating cash flow significantly trail their peers.The most recent rally in share price has been fueled by weak catalysts.,"The Gist of ItGroupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) recent rise in stock price should be treated as an opportunity to liquidate or even play the downside.A Deteriorating PictureEven with Groupon's stock price falling over 40% this year, valuation is still rich considering the deterioration in financials. Investors have been continually disappointed with Groupon's inability to create positive trends across their bottom line. While the stock price has somewhat reflected the company struggles, a retest of the lows may well be warranted.The company's primary weaknesses can be seen across multiple areas including a deteriorating net income, weak operating cash flow, and below expectations return on equity.In their most recent quarter, Groupon suffered a steep decline in earnings per share in comparison to its performance from the same quarter last year. While Groupon slightly beat revenue expectations their outlook remained weak and ultimately sent the shares downward.In addition to lower earnings, the company's current return on equity is below its ROE for the same quarter one year ago. In fact, Groupon's return on equity significantly trails both the S&P and the industry average. In Q1 2014 Groupon had a return on equity of -15.64 while the industry was at 17.23 and the S&P 500 is at 14.48.Finally, net operating cash flow plummeted $-20.72 million when compared to the same quarter last year. This translates into a growth rate that is significantly lower to the industry average as well.Valuation and TradeGroupon's stock price hit a new all-time low this year at $5.18 per share. Since then, the stock has made feeble rallies to approximately the $6.50 per share level. The most recent rally has been primarily attributed to Groupon's ""freebies"" offers, as well as, Priceline's (PCLN) acquisition of Opentable (NASDAQ:OPEN). Should these actually be the catalysts sending shares higher, the quality of the rally should be question. Therefore, investors might consider playing the downside from here. Without a more positive outlook regarding Groupon's core business activities, shares should retest the low of $5.18 per share (see Groupon 3 month chart below). (Source: OptionsXpress)Shorting the stock price at current levels and placing a target around the 52 week low would still provide investors returns between 15% and 20% gains. Those returns could be greater should investors choose to play in the money put options.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2237303,64773,2014-05-26T04:57:24-04:00,An integrated merchant platform can be a key to secure the future growth.Rising operating costs continue to hinder the overall profitability and send Groupon's stock to 52-week low.Groupon can potentially turn its risks into a competitive advantage.,"""Don't leave home without it!"" Think it again. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) envisions a not-too-distant future where you don't need to carry credit cards with you when you make purchases. Imagine you can enjoy your Bahamas vacation without the wallet as if you were at home. If you are a small business owner, there is no more embarrassing moment in front of your customers when your card reader does not work. This vision may become a reality as Groupon just announced an iPad-based checkout platform called Gnome that can replace merchants' cash registers. With a $10 monthly fee and much lower transaction fee (1.8% + $0.15) compared with others ranging from 2.75% to 3.50%, it makes small business owners irresistible. Groupon has worked with various strategic partners, including Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) and Teradata (NYSE:TDC), to create an integrated all-in-one merchant solution to help the small business owners to run their entire businesses, where Wells Fargo & Co takes care of the credit-card processing service and Teradata analyzes and builds business intelligence. It is also capable of integrating popular accounting software programs including Xero (OTCPK:XROLF) and Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Quickbooks. With this innovation, Groupon has expanded its portfolio outside of daily deals business.Potential Risks for GnomeSome analysts have argued that Groupon's business model has sucked value out of the small businesses since it has a 50/50 split on the revenue, and this will eventually lose all of the local merchants. But Groupon has rebutted its criticisms by saying that they do the marketing side of the business for the merchants and if the deal is off, merchants pay nothing at all. This time with Gnome, Groupon can really help small businesses to run their businesses more effectively. Groupon must have realized that in order to make their business model sustainable, they must put the value back to the local merchants. By creating a tighter relation with merchants, it can create a long-lasting value to the company and hinder competitors.Because this is just released, we don't know if Groupon will make this platform a mandatory for all of its merchants. It looks like Groupon will only get its main revenue through making deals from merchants, and not from the payment processing service. If the merchants use Gnome and not running any deals, Groupon will not get the revenue it wishes unless Groupon improves the way of marketing merchants' products and services more effectively than before. Beside the risk of not generating revenue for Groupon, there is a certain risk associated with the product acceptance by the merchants. Whether or not the software will perform as promised can be another potential risk associated with Gnome. Nevertheless, it is too early to make any assumption or predication about it at this time.Analysis of Financial Conditions and Operational RisksWhen we examine the annual earnings since its IPO, we see that, despite posting a diluted earnings per share loss of $0.44 on revenues of $1,610 million in the first year, 2011, Groupon was able to pull out of it to an earnings of $0.11 a share and $2,574 million in revenues in 2013.Groupon generates revenue generally through making deals with the merchants. Both the numbers of active deals and active customers are important in evaluating the growth of the business. Groupon continues to gain momentum in the number of active deals in both North America and globally every quarter. For example, in North America, the active deals increased to over 95,000 and the total active deals globally were over 200,000. These gains translate into the revenue growth we see in each quarter. However, many investors were upset to see a net loss per share of $0.01 in the 2014 Q1 results and the adjusted EBITDA was $40.3M, a 44% drop compared to the quarterly average of $71.7M.Source: GrouponIronically with the increased revenue growth, we saw profitability decline due to heavy sales and marketing expenses and investment in launching new service platforms for merchants. The biggest risk for Groupon is still dependent on how to attract consumers to see the deals. Since last year, Groupon has changed its Push strategy from sending daily deals emails to subscribers to Pull strategy, where it lets customers to search deals in their area. Groupon will continue to spend $25 million for this Pull strategy each quarter until it sees the positive effects in the transition. The transformation in the strategy is seen to be necessary for reducing dependency from the daily deals business, but it requires time to deliver results. As of March 31, 2014, over 80 million people have downloaded Groupon Mobile apps. 75% of Groupon's North American advertisers have signed up for monthly recurring deals through the new Pull program. The idea is that whenever consumers need to look for a deal, they will pull out their mobile devices and search from there instead of opening their emails to see time-sensitive offers and promotions. The change in customer behavior could be a potential risk as well. If Groupon is heading in the right direction, we will see it before the end of this year. However, with this strategy, it forces Groupon to compete with Amazon.com and Priceline.com directly. In order to differentiate itself from the fierce competition, Groupon is trying to secure its base consumers while building tighter relation with its merchants. In doing so, Groupon risks to spend more on marketing needs and innovative platforms.When rising risks, in terms of spending on growth, investment and innovative products, is to gain a competitive advantage, these risks may be worthwhile from a long-term perspective. Groupon's stock is now at 52-week low levels, but it may have upside potential if the company can effectively control its operating costs. When the innovative merchant platforms roll out and gain some traction, this would be a good sign for a long-term investment opportunity.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

2206873,20521,2014-05-09T12:48:45-04:00,,"Online daily deals site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) does not seem to be recovering at all. Earlier this week, they announced quarterly results that managed to exceed market projections. But despite their performance, a weak industry outlook and rising company costs sent the stock tumbling to 52-week low figures. According to a report by IBISWorld, the daily deals industry in 2013 was pegged to be worth $3.3 billion in revenues, recording a 15% growth over the year. But growth is expected to slow down significantly this year, when the industry is projected to grow a comparatively meager 3.5% to $3.4 billion. The research report estimates growth to remain at 4% levels till 2018 when the industry will be worth $4 billion in revenues.Groupon's FinancialsGroupon's first quarter revenues grew 26% over the year to $757.6 million, ahead of market expectations of $734.0 million. Loss per share of $0.01 was also ahead of the Street's projections of loss of $0.03 per share.By segment, revenues from direct sales doubled to $331 million while revenues from third-party sources fell marginally to $426 million. By region, revenues from North America grew 27% to $431 million. EMEA revenues grew 26% to $231 million and revenues from the Rest of the World grew 23% over the year.Among operating metrics, Groupon had 51.8 million active customers at the end of March, recording a 24% growth over the year. North America accounted for 21.8 million customers and 14.5 million customers were in EMEA. 15.5 million subscribers were based in the rest of the world. Groupon ended the quarter with 200,000 average active deals compared with 140,000 a year ago. Mobile continued to grow as they reported a 54% increase in transaction over mobile devices. During the quarter, Groupon saw 10 million downloads for their mobile apps. Average trailing twelve month billing per active customer declined marginally from $134 a year ago to $132 for the latest quarter.For the current quarter, Groupon forecast revenues of $725 million-$775 million with EPS of $0.00-$0.02. The Street was projecting revenues of $758 million with an EPS of $0.03. Groupon revised their EBITDA projections for the year upwards from $287 million to $300 million.Groupon's Rising Costs While Groupon may have managed to report better than expected losses for the quarter, their operating income performance speaks another story. The increasing share of direct revenues hurt their gross margin as these product revenues are accompanied by higher costs. As a result, while revenues grew 26% over the year, Groupon saw gross margin fall from 63% to 59%. Add to that their continued investments in marketing efforts which drove sales and marketing expenses up by 60% over the year to $78.9 million. Part of that increase was attributed to the recent launch of Groupon Deal Builder, their self-service platform for merchants that lets them create deals without interacting with a sales representative.Groupon is taking active steps to manage their costs better. As part of this initiative, they are evaluating several options and are proposing changes like increasing the free shipping threshold from $19.99 to $24.99. They are also working to shift fulfillment to their own distribution center in Kentucky for the U.S. market. For international markets, Groupon plans to cut costs by consolidating back office operations.But the market is not pleased with Groupon's stock and it is trading at 52-week low levels of $5.30 with a market capitalization of $3.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $12.76 in September last year. It has lost more than 73% of its value since listing at $20."

It trades for a big discount to its $20 2011 IPO price. This article will not dive into Groupon's financial performance, but will give some perspective to some of the many execution mistakes Groupon is making.Big Decrease in Marketing ExpensesGroupon defines marketing expenses as:Here is the 2009-2013 chart of selling and marketing expenses:Groupon decreased spend about to almost 1/4 of 2011 levels while increasing other expenses nearly 50% from 2011 levels. Any company that has to show growth and profit with these kinds of changes has big headwinds to overcome. To further highlight this headwind, compare North America, where marketing spend increased 7% in 2013 to EMEA and Rest of World, where marketing spend decreased by more than 50%. North America showed growth in all businesses and 7% growth in the Local Voucher business, while EMEA and Rest of World both saw a decline in the Local Voucher business, which is Groupon's most important and highest margin business. In addition, Groupon's North American take rate went up from 2012 to 2013.Groupon Goods MistakesGroupon Goods is a newer low-margin business where Groupon sells physical goods directly to the consumer. If I do a search for ""yoga"" on Groupon, Groupon Goods listings for yoga mats and pants appear alongside those for discount yoga classes. The only differentiator from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Overstock (NASDAQ:OSTK) is that Groupon only sells its discounted products for a limited time, and it tells you how popular each deal is.Groupon Goods is missing some key features. There is no way to sort the products for sale. Typically you can sort by price, popularity, average review, etc. In Groupon's case, you might want to sort by newest or soon-to-expire deals as well. Groupon lacks reviews, and when I observed my wife was shopping on Groupon, she constantly was checking Amazon for reviews. The only reason to purchase from Groupon is the price. Finally, Groupon lists X-rated products in sections where they don't belong. Groupon's Minimalist Coupon FeatureYou would expect Groupon to do something innovative when it comes to coupons. RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) consistently ranks well in the search engines and is the company to beat when it comes to coupons. RetailMeNot collects user data to determine which coupons work and are popular. If the coupon/promo code is not on RetailMeNot, there likely is not a discount available. Groupon calls its coupon section ""Freebies,"" as Groupon typically sells vouchers/coupons. Each company's page is a simple list of coupons. For example, I clicked on American Eagle (NYSE:AEO). The first coupon on Groupon is ""Free Shipping on Men's and Women's Shoes."" When I look at RetailMeNot, the top deal is ""Additional 40% Clearance + Free Shipping."" Groupon has 10 Deals, RetailMeNot has 27. I don't see any reason why people would use Groupon over RetailMeNot, besides Groupon's much more powerful brand.Looking ForwardThese mistakes have stifled growth and hurt Groupon's stock price, but looking long term, they are all mostly fixable. Any company that reduces marketing expense to around 25% of prior levels and maintains/grows revenue is growing. Groupon will continue to grow top line revenue, and if they streamline operations, they will start to show profit, which justifies the stock price. This is stark contrast to competitors like Zulilly (NASDAQ:ZU) which have a long way to go to justify its stock price. I am long Groupon and am looking to sell more covered puts.Disclosure: I am long GRPN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2152263,44981,2014-04-21T17:07:38-04:00,"A small shift in the business model from email-based ""push"" to more extensive online ""pull"" marketplace will enhance the revenue growth.The expansion in the business segments, as well as the global reach will support the future growth.The recent dip in the stock price gives a good entry point to the long-term investors of the company.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a global leader in local commerce, enabling the people around the world to search and discover great businesses and merchandise at a discount. The company increased its global active customers by a decent margin over the last year, with a considerable growth potential expected in the coming years. However, the stock has plunged almost 38% year-to-date, which is due to the small unexpected loss in the current quarter after the spiking higher results for its holiday season. Though, in this article, we will discuss the company's performance over the last year with underlying growth potential in the industry, along with future growth prospects and potential risks.Business ModelIn order to understand the performance of Groupon, we must have a clear picture of its business model. The company operates online local commerce marketplace throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount. The company acts as an intermediary between merchants and consumers, and charges a pre-defined spread from the merchants, called third-party merchandise. Further, the company also performs direct selling to the end-consumers, with comparably greater profit margins, named as direct selling merchandise. The gross billings and revenue recognition in both conditions vary - the gross billings, which represent the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services, differ from the company revenue in the third-party transactions; however, both are same while selling direct merchandise to the consumers.Financial PerformanceThe e-commerce businesses are now deriving a huge portion of their profits from global sales. Groupon also imitated the trend and started concentrating on the international market. The company performed much better on a number of financial and non-financial metrics over the last year. Moreover, the company grew its global gross billings by 7% to $5.8 billion during the last year, with major growth coming from the North American and EMEA regions. Groupon multiplied its customer base in the last few years, and currently has 44.9 million active customers, which grew by 9% year-over-year as of the last year, ensuring its growth in the future.The increased customer base enabled the company to grow its revenue by 13% during the last year compared to 2012 - the North American region was again the main growth driver, with an increase of about 9%. However, over the last year, the income from operations decreased by 23% due to the lower margins, which were willingly accepted to improve the quality and increase the number of deals offered to customers and to expand the company's online marketplaces.Groupon also recorded net losses of $95 million in the last year, which is mainly due to the expenses related to impairment of the Groupon's investment in ""Life Media Limited"" (known as FTuan), which offers discounted products and services from vendors in China. FTuan has operated in losses since its inception, and has used proceeds from equity offerings to grow its business.Future Growth ProspectsThe business model of Groupon continues to evolve from an email-based ""push"" model with a limited number of deals offered, to more extensive online ""pull"" marketplaces, where customers can come to Groupon and search for deals on goods and services. These marketplaces are accessible through the company websites and mobile applications. The mobile industry has grown very quickly over the last few years, especially with the introduction of smartphones. The transition to mobile apps and pull strategy is a key in building of a smoother, more efficient model for the company. The consumers are increasingly accessing the deals through the mobile application, with nearly 50% of the global transactions being completed on mobile devices in the last year, and nearly 70 million people have now downloaded the mobile application worldwide.Recently, Groupon completed the acquisition of LivingSocial Korea, a company that owns Ticket Monster, which is the fastest growing e-commerce companies in the region, and Ideeli, a fashion flash site in the United States, for $25 million. Together, in the first quarter of the current year, these investments are expected to contribute approximately $50 million to the company revenue. This investment will accelerate the transition of company's strategy to mobile and pull model, and therefore, give a boost to revenue growth and earnings in the coming years.Potential RisksThe unique business model of Groupon surely has a great potential, which requires appropriate implementation and strong competitive advantage in order to survive for a longer run. However, there are also some potential risks attributed towards it. The biggest and foremost risk is that the business model of the company is easy to replicate by other companies. The company's deals with merchants have not been comparatively large - also, it does not compete with bigger market players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Another risk attributed towards Groupon business model was the online-only existence of the company, which suffers a customer retention problem in the long run. Nonetheless, this risk is hedged by expanding in the physical goods space by considering the success of leading online retailer, Amazon. The company is building a network of warehouses that will allow it to deliver the physical goods to its customers directly. This will also increase the company's deals with merchants with a considerable warehouse space to keep the inventory.ConclusionThe long-term prospects of the company look good, and the recent dip will allow the investors to add to their positions. The company is growing its global footprint, and the further expansion in business segments will allow it to grow in the medium-long term. There are some risks regarding the business model of the company; however, being the pioneer and the leader should allow Groupon to fend off competition from the smaller players or new entrants.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2197833,62713,2014-05-07T08:03:41-04:00,"Several years ago, Google made a $6-billion bid for Groupon.With Groupon now 23% cheaper than Google's initial offer price, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of Google coming back to the table with an offer.Groupon just became its own best deal.","Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares are still under pressure ever since the stock reached a year-to-date high of $12.42 in January. With Tuesday's close of $6.72, Groupon has lost close to 50% of its value since it peaked. Shares are down 42% year-to-date.Investors are stuck wondering if Groupon's recent decline suddenly makes the stock ""a great deal"", or is this a falling-knife situation. But the more pressing question should be, has Groupon done anything to deserve this punishment? And following the company's first-quarter earnings report and disappointing guidance, it doesn't seem as if this bleeding is going to stop anytime soon.First and foremost, I don't believe Groupon's earnings report, which included a beat on revenue and profits, revealed the sort of fundamental problems that would justify this level of punishment. The Street just didn't like what management had to say about the next quarter.But recall, this is exactly where we were back in January, after the stock peaked at $12.42. In the February quarter, the company also beat earnings estimates by 2 cents, posting adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share. This is while revenue rose slightly above 20% to $768.4 million from the previous year, which beat estimates of $718 million by 7%. So Groupon's fourth-quarter report was even stronger.But the stock plummeted after management (then) issued weaker-than-expected first-quarter guidance - the same report Groupon just beat. So it seems this cycle is going to continue until Groupon decides it's going to issue better confidence. Let's go through the numbers.First-quarter revenue rose 26% year-over-year to $757.6 million, topping last year's mark of $601.4 million. North America revenue increased 27%, EMEA increased 26% and Rest of World increased 23%. Recall, analysts had been modeling $740 million. And given the weaker-than-expected results that has come out from other online/internet companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Groupon's numbers stand out.The strong revenue results yielded a net loss per share of a penny, excluding some costs. The Street was looking for a loss of 3 cents. But despite the constant fears of competitive threats from the likes of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon, that Groupon was able to raise its gross billings 29% is nothing short of impressive.Gross billings, which grew to $1.82 billion, is the metric that reflects the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services, excluding applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds. In the North Americas, gross billion grew 15%, while the EMEA increased 4% and Rest of World increased 123%. Management attributed the growth to the acquisition of Ticket Monster.All told, the company posted a 2% increase in gross profit, which reached $385.7 million. In terms of guidance for the current quarter, the company projects revenue to come in the range of $725 million to $775 million, which falls in line with Street estimates of $758 million. Analysts didn't like the earnings-per-share forecast, which calls for break-even. The Street was looking for a 3-cent profit.Here again, Groupon's guidance seems in accordance with the company trying to execute what analysts believed the company must do to remain viable, including spending to grow its international footprint. Not to mention, developing capabilities to monetization mobile. But these moves aren't cheap, which is what is presumed in the break-even earnings projection. So the notion that Groupon is this terrible business with no future seems contradictory to what these numbers represent.With these shares still down significantly, Groupon becomes a possible acquisition target for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which has made it clear that it wanted to get into the deals business as a way to grow more advertising. Recall, several years ago, Google made a $6-billion bid for Groupon. So with Groupon now 23% cheaper than Google's initial offer price, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of Google coming back to the table with an offer. Groupon just became its own best deal.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

2107873,58981,2014-03-25T11:47:34-04:00,Graham's growth stock formula must be modified to value Groupon.Rosy forecasts show potential for profit in Groupon stock late in 2015 or 2016.Large variance in estimates and opinions make this a risky proposition.,"In the ""Intelligent Investor"" Benjamin Graham lays out the case for being a defensive investor or an enterprising investor. He goes on to lay out guidelines and analysis techniques an investor can use to make investment decisions. One of these comes in chapter 11 where he discusses basic security analysis without rewriting his tome on security analysis. This article will be a brief application of the formula for valuing growth stocks he provides as a quick method to estimate a value for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). While not a rigid application I hope this adds value to the discussion on Groupon by providing another viewpoint on where the stock price is in relation to current and future value.The Formula and assumptions needed to make the calculationGraham provides a basic formula in the section entitled ""Capitalization Rates for Growth Stocks"" (page 295 of the 2003 edition) that is:Value = Current (normal) earnings x (8.5 plus twice expected annual growth rate)Immediately issues and objections can be raised by the reader familiar with both Graham style analysis and Groupon. First, Graham used conservative methodology to determine normal earnings, using historic earnings and tried to normalize swings in the earnings. Second, Groupon has not reported annual profitable earnings yet-so any use of a negative earnings number would naturally result in negative values. Third, what is the annual expected earnings growth rate-both from a negative base and with professional analysts' estimates having a large variance over the next five years?Graham encouraged conservatism and caution for two good reasons. First if the investor uses caution and estimates turn out to be on the low side, the positive surprise only increases the future return while still meeting or exceeding expectations. Second, he pointed out that when future estimates are large or have large variances, small errors can be compounded and could have disastrous effects. Reviewing the formula above shows one effect of this-when doubling the future estimated earnings growth then multiplying earnings by this number plus 8.5 even a 2% lower earnings growth could cause a wild swing.So it's time to make some assumptions to make the formula ""work"" and try to make some valuation estimates for Groupon, then compare our results to current stock price and future price estimates. Looking at analysts' opinions from NASDAQ.com and Yahoo! Finance, the 2015 earnings are estimated to range from $.05 to $.27 per share. NASDAQ.com also provides a 5-year earnings growth estimate of 26.6%. This number masks one cautionary feature-many analysts estimate large earning growth in 2015 and 2017 but zero growth in 2016. To keep numbers round without introducing even more variance, here is the formula with some information added:Groupon value = earnings x (8.5+53.2) or earnings x 62So let's do this-math that isSo we have a fairly simple tool we can enter various estimated earnings with a consensus earning growth multiplier and make some forecast values. First, modifying the formula with current price of $8.04 (as of 3/24 per Yahoo! Finance) we divide 8.04/62 to show the stock is priced as if Groupon was earning $.13 this year-well above estimates. Looking at other earnings estimates, these results are generated:Earnings Formula valuation$.05 $3.10$.10 $6.20$.20 $12.40$.27 $16.74As this short table shows, the low estimate of $.05 shows Groupon is significantly overvalued even after recent losses, while the best case estimate results in a doubling from the current stock price. The current price range over the past few days relates to a valuation near the mid-point of earning estimates for 2015.So now what?Based on the more conservative estimates, and the fact that Groupon has yet to report positive annual earnings my opinion is Groupon is overvalued by ""Mr. Market"" at its current trading price of $8.04. Future earning estimates and earnings growth have such wide differences that the stock could be anywhere from 50% undervalued (most optimistic) to 250% overvalued based on forecasts for the next 20 months. For a Grahamite ""Intelligent Investor"" Groupon is far too risky at the present. As many comments and writers point out, Groupon could double by late 2015 or early 2016, but I feel this is based more on momentum and the higher earning estimates. Could Groupon's stock price double (or more) over the next two years? Yes, but the valuation model provided by Graham must be pushed nearly to breaking to show why. However, each investor is encouraged to conduct his or her own analysis on top of this article and make their own decision. As always, there are two sides to every trade and I hope your trades work out well!Update: Despite being called a ""short"", I recently initiated a small position in GRPN and immediately wrote near term at the money calls to capitalize on the option premium and earnings this week. So I now have ""skin in the game"" on GRPN for those who have called out my warnings and caution!Disclosure: I am long GRPN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2162603,20568,2014-04-24T15:31:57-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) became a Zacks #5 Rank in February after another disappointing quarterly report. Since then, the stock has fought to stay above $8 but cannot seem to regain investor confidence as it tests $7. And the only estimate revisions since they were slashed 2 months ago have been slight notches downward.I thought it was a good time to revisit the piece I wrote back then to recall why Wall Street analysts and investors were so underwhelmed and why the stock remains a #5 Rank. Here was how I approached a business I am not even sure I understood well enough to invest in.""In the fluid world where e-commerce and social media waters merge, it's sometimes hard for investors to figure out what's going on with the business models and the growth strategy. That was nowhere more evident in February when Groupon crushed investor hopes again with another disastrous quarterly report."" What follows is the bulk of the analysis from my February report...The Q4 news wasn't all terrible as revenues jumped 20.4% year-over-year to $768.4 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $719.0 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by a 63.0% jump in direct revenues, which offset a 2.8% decline in third party and other revenues in the last quarter.And region-wise, revenues from North America and EMEA surged 18.2% and 42.5% year-over-year, respectively. This more than offset a 15.3% decline in revenues from the rest of the world (Asia-Pacific and Latin America).But guidance was weak and signs of the turnaround got pushed further out as the decline in North American business is not what Wall Street wanted to hear. For this, shares were pummeled 22% to $8 on massive volume of nearly 140 million shares (more than 7X the average).Clear Sailing in Platform and Mobile GrowthGroupon reported that active customers increased 9% year-over-year to 44.9 million, comprising 20.8 million in North America, 14.2 million in EMEA and 9.9 million in the rest of the world.Approximately 50% of the worldwide transactions were through mobile devices. Moreover, more than 9 million people downloaded Groupon's mobile app during the quarter, which led to a robust mobile business.Murky Waters in NA Comps and Biz DevThe earnings outlook for Q1 and FY 2014 were significantly below consensus estimates with an implied FY EBITDA guide of $300mn vs. consensus of nearly $400mn. North America Local billings grew only 1.5% year-over-year over a tough comp a year ago when the company lowered take rates (rev share) to drive billings. But the deceleration from +13% y-o-y growth in Q3 remains a concern.Gross margin plunged 660 basis points (bps) to 49.2% in the quarter due to an unfavorable business mix. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $29.7 million compared with $71.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus noted that ""Groupon appears to be fixing its merchant-facing platform, but consumers have not yet responded in a compelling fashion. That is forcing some higher spending on marketing in 1Q/2014. Investments in two recent acquisitions (Ticket Monster and Ideeli, which both closed in January 2014) are also pressuring margins. Our billings estimate for 2014 falls slightly (ex acquisitions), while our EBITDA falls materially.""Groupon's net loss (including stock-based compensation but excluding acquisition-related expenses and impairment charges) was $1.7 million, which was slightly better than a loss of $25.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. But a good chunk of this only came from lower expenses which is not really what Wall Street cares about right now with this company.The Q1 guidance is probably what made investors shoot first last week. Adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $20 million and $40 million, below the prior consensus estimate of $93 million, in part because of negative contributions from its recent acquisitions and additional marketing investments.Dead Calm Before the Storm?I met a former employee of Groupon last week (before the Febraury earnings report) and asked him what he thought about the growth of their businesses going forward. I couldn't get an answer I was satisfied with as I watched the stock trade above $10. I knew a lot of major Wall Street houses were recently bullish with price targets near $15 so I was mildly interested in the opportunity.But when I read the research reports following the company's quarterly blow-up, I wasn't any more sure what to make of this business - except that earnings estimates, growth projections and price targets were coming down.Many analysts believe Groupon is well positioned to gain from rising e-Commerce spending on mobile devices, a profitable domestic market and an under-penetrated international market. These opportunities can continue to drive top-line growth, especially with increased traction in mobile.However, others believe that while the negative impact of increasing investments on profitability is a temporary factor, the company's decision to reduce focus on China is a long-term negative.And Macquarie analysts talked about facets of the business that seemed important but which eluded my understanding.""GRPN said the slowdown was due to a tough take-rate comp, delayed consumer purchases related to a shift from a 'push' to a 'pull' model, and more email space dedicated to goods.""Finally, the company continues to face significant competition not only from the stalwarts like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but also from small companies like LiveDeal.Bottom line: While the turnaround seemed promising, there are enough headwinds and uncertainties here to stay away. The Zacks Rank will tell you when it's safe to go back into Groupon.

2126813,23479,2014-04-04T16:05:40-04:00,,"One of the reasons why Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) North American operations are most valuable is its high take rate in the region. This metric refers to the percentage share of Groupon in customer purchases and is calculated by dividing the company’s revenues by gross billings. Groupon’s take rate in North America has increased from 40.7% in 2011 to 53.4% in 2013, and stands much higher than the figure for EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and the rest of the world. This can be attributed to an increase in negotiating leverage in the region, as well as higher proportion of direct sales. We expect this trend to continue, and to help Groupon build a relatively stable business with greater control over the sales outcome.Our current price estimate for Groupon stands at $8.45, implying a premium of about 5%-10% over the market price.Why Groupon’s Take Rate Will Continue To Go Up Groupon has the clear intention to expand in the physical goods space, considering the success that online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has witnessed in this area. Online spending has grown significantly over the past decade, as lower operating costs have enabled merchants to offer deep discounts to their end customers, thereby spurring demand. Global e-commerce  sales have jumped from $482 billion in 2009 to an estimated $963 billion in 2013. In North America alone, online retail sales have gone up from $132 billion in 2008 to $263 billion in 2013, accounting for roughly 5.8% of total retail sales. The trend is not only encouraging, but also shows tremendous growth potential. Groupon’s decision to push for physical goods sales is intended to leverage this growing market.The company is investing in building a warehouse network that will allow it to ship physical goods to its customers directly, instead of relying on its merchants. It needs to maintain a high level of customer service and delivery standards if it has to compete against incumbents. Groupon has mentioned that it intends to sell some specific items at the best possible prices, and isn’t interested in selling everything just yet. Although Groupon’s deals business has crumbled in international markets, the silver lining is that the brand is recognized in the U.S. The company can leverage its large user base to successfully expand its physical goods retailing business domestically. Most of the physical goods sales is likely to come through the direct sales channel wherein Groupon is the owner merchant, and is responsible for storage and delivery of goods and merchandise. This implies that gross billings and net revenue are same and the take rate is 100%. As the proportion of direct sales increases, Groupon’s overall take rate will go up.Additionally, Groupon is the biggest social discounted buying service in the world. Its sheer scale and presence make it attractive for companies that want to promote themselves on a nationwide or worldwide scale. This means Groupon, with its growing customer base, will always remain attractive for businesses. This should help the company maintain or possibly improve its take rate on most deals, especially with its efforts at retaining customers and making the deals more relevant.Disclosure: No positions"

In reality, companies that have explosive potential for growth in the stock market are in greater demand than those with moderate growth.This is why high-momentum growth stocks like Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the stock market are demanding high and somewhat excessive valuations. (Read “This New Tech-Related Sector Is Hot.”) Yet if the stock market is willing to pay the extreme valuations, you can also trade these stocks, but make sure you also have an exit strategy.For the investor, the key is to view weakness as a buying opportunity to go in and accumulate new or additional positions in a stock.One such stock that I feel is worth a look after a selloff is online coupon provider Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN), which has collapsed to the current $8.00 level and, at this price, is worth a look for the aggressive speculator looking for a possible and likely bounce in the stock.Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.comIt’s at a time like this when you should be looking for good upside stocks in the stock market that have, for whatever reason, been sold off but the business remains intact.Groupon sent investors running for the exits in the stock market after offering weak guidance, which of course, puts into the spotlight questions regarding the validity of its business model.In my stock analysis, Groupon is merely going through its growing pains. The company has tremendous upside for those willing to put some risk capital forward.The company provides daily deals on goods and services to its user base via daily mail blasts and through its website. The company receives a portion of the profits from the deal sold. I have bought deals using Groupon on numerous occasions and feel the business model is intact. Granted, the barriers to entry are not that high, but having said that, Groupon has a commanding lead.Groupon has excellent long-term upside but will, over time, face hurdles, which I feel the company will be able to overcome.This is why you should look at sell-offs in popular trading stocks as a buying opportunity to buy at a discounted sale price, rather than chase and buy the stock at higher prices.It’s not magic or a well-kept secret formula to successful stock market investing, but rather just the insight to buy good companies on temporary weakness, such as Groupon.Disclosure: None"
2046073,22775,2014-02-25T10:50:03-05:00,,"For once, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) delivered a good set of quarterly earnings with both revenues and EPS surprising on the upside, and operating income coming in close to consensus expectation.Despite the rising contribution of e-commerce revenues (which are less profitable), the US business was healthy as we expected (see our previous article) with a margin up 130bps year-on-year to 5.8% and EMEA in turnaround mode with 6% revenue growth in the quarter and a margin up 970bps to 14.7%.Unfortunately, these key positives were overshadowed by a poor Q1 EBITDA guidance ($20-40m vs. consensus at $96m) as the integration of Ticket Monster and ideeli is expected to have a $20m negative impact and as Groupon decided to step up its marketing and growth investments ($25m impact).The model is in transition, but is starting to deliverWe expected growth initiatives, such as the expansion in flash sales, to have no major negative impact on earnings as Groupon's management seemed committed to improving group profitability. Obviously we were wrong. And this disappointing guidance acts as a reminder that the business model is still in transition and that earnings releases are likely to remain tricky for a while.Anyway, we reiterate our view that Groupon's new business model is starting to deliver, as illustrated by the group's sound Q4 performance which compares well against disappointing earnings at e-commerce peers Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Notably, the reacceleration in revenue growth (+20% in Q4 vs. +5% in Q3) was a key positive.The decision to exit China was also great news and demonstrated management's discipline against a backdrop of still poor performances from its RoW business in Q4. Increasing financial discipline is likely to help going forward.On the margin side, we would not see too negatively the $25m extra costs announced to boost growth. Notably the marketing investments in order to increase the mobile & pull platforms awareness are easily understandable. Groupon seeks to reduce as soon as possible its reliance on e-mails and to take customers to its mobile app and site.The transition to mobile & pull is key in the building of a smoother, more efficient model. The $25m investment, likely to be a one-off, will accelerate the transition and therefore give a boost to revenue growth and earnings from 2015 onwards.In all, limited earnings growth in 2014 should not be seen as an issue as it will be followed by a strong earnings leverage in our view driven by: 1) solid revenue growth 2) decline in marketing costs from the 2014 peak and 3) rising profitability of international operations.Against this backdrop, we do not view the stock's 2015 P/E of 25x as excessive and reiterate our Buy.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

The previous article sourced the company's amended S-1/A SEC form filed on February 14, 2014 and should have sourced the S-1/A form filed on February 25, 2014 containing the 2nd amendment reporting a 2.5 for 1 reverse stock split. Therefore, the article is rendered inconsistent with the company's 2nd amendment to its S-1/A SEC filing on February 25, 2014 and was confusing to anyone reading it. My sincere apology to all!Coupons.com's ValuationThe initial public offering of Coupons.com (NASDAQ:COUP) debuted on Friday, March 7, 2014, raising approximately $168 million from its IPO. The stock was priced at $16 per share, up from the previous $12 to $14, and not surprisingly, opened at $27.10 per share. Shares surged to $33 before closing at $30.According to Coupons.com's S-1/A SEC filing on February 25, 2014, the company has never been profitable since it began in 1998.After 15 years of coupon sales, Coupons.com's gross revenues for 2013 came in at $167.8 million. Not exactly a barnburner, but according to one source and the company's 2013 financial report, gross revenues jumped about 49% YOY in 2013, with Q4 income turning a net profit of $1.5 million. Net losses for the full year 2013 were $11.2 million.Coupons.com's IPO generated approximately $168 million for the company. Coupons.com now has a sizable war chest to grow its business over the next 12 to 24 months.Coupons.com, RetailMeNot and Groupon By ComparisonBased on Coupons.com's first day of trading, its current market cap at the close of trading ($30 per share) was approximately $2.2 billion, or 13.3 times gross revenues (see chart).Coupons.com's closest competitor is RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) with a market cap of approximately $2.3 billion and 2013 gross revenues of approximately $210 million. Recently, shares have been trading around 11 times gross revenues. RetailMeNot has about $166 million in cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2013. RetailMeNot had a blowout 2013 Q4, as did Coupons.com and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). But wait a minute - RetailMeNot is carrying a $41 million debt and Coupons.com's debt is listed as $23 million. Nevertheless, I would rank RetailMeNot ahead of Coupons.com, but both companies pale in comparison to Groupon.Groupon is the largest mobile digital e-commerce company in the world. As you review Groupon's fundamentals, it is not difficult to understand Groupon's valuation is absolutely wrong. This assessment is not my exclusive reasoning, but a reflection of analysts' valuations and Groupon's intrinsic value. Groupon's market cap is $5.9 billion with $2.57 billion in gross revenues and trading at a meager 2.3 times gross revenues. Factor in no debt, $1.2 billion in cash and a blowout Q4 beating all estimates and Groupon looks irresistible.Review the table below and you will find value hiding in plain sight.Let's Find Groupon's Hidden ValueWhat is a fair market cap for Groupon? Should we use Coupons.com's rich valuation formula of 13.3 times gross revenues, a company that warned us in its S-1/A that since inception it has failed to achieve profitability? A company that only earned $1.5 million net revenues in Q4 2013 and reported annual gross revenues of $167.8 million, 15 times less than Groupon?Maybe RetailMeNot's 11 times gross revenues would be your valuation choice? With $41 million debt and only $210 in gross revenues, it is 12 times smaller than Groupon.Before you decide a proper valuation for Groupon, let's expand our valuation prospective by looking at some other social media stocks. Let's consider the following:The pie chart to the right reveals Groupon's market dominance over its peers. It is not possible to adequately explain the glaring lack of parity between these valuations. If you believe that Coupons.com and RetailMeNot are fairly valued, then Groupon would be clearly undervalued. But to honestly postulate the argument that Groupon is somehow correctly valued at 2.3 times gross revenues cannot be based on sound judgment, peer valuations, conventional valuations or Groupon's fundamentals.Through comparative analysis, Groupon is grossly undervalued at 2.3 times gross revenues, while Coupons.com and RetailMeNot are overvalued at 13.3 and 11 times gross revenues, respectively.In a previous article, ""'Buy' Ratings Mark Groupon As Undervalued"", published in November 2013, I valued Groupon at a conservative 4 times gross revenues or $15 per share. This valuation remains unchanged because Groupon is clearly undervalued. If the same valuation were ascribed to Groupon as is its peers (11 to 13 times gross revenues), shares of Groupon would trade around $41 per share.ConclusionThe facts are self-evident: Groupon is grossly undervalued at 2.3 times gross revenues and many investors know this to be true. By comparison to its peers, it becomes evident that Groupon's valuation should be much higher. A 4 times gross revenues valuation, $15 per share should be on the horizon, but that should be the low end of Groupon's valuation.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

2063483,21543,2014-03-03T13:01:43-05:00,,"The recent rush to judgment by some Wall Street pundits just might rank among the worst knee-jerk commentary on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) in 2014. Nearly everything I read seemed to be the paraphrased ramblings of the ""other guy."" Little content and less substance couched in headline grabbing degradation of a company that just reported a stellar Q4 financial report seemed incongruent and unacceptable.After reviewing and assimilating Groupon's Q4 financial report, which cannot possibly be properly analyze in 1 to 15 minutes after its release, you find yourself questioning the entire decline. Read or listen to the conference call and you really began to question the selling. At some point the facts began to overwhelm the malodorous fear mongering propaganda that is being dished out. Finally, you realize that the selling was irrational, but the damage is done. The positive side, however, is that a buying opportunity has emerged.The historical chart to the right records 5 years of growth for Groupon. When you factor in Groupon's recent acquisition of Ticket Monster and Ideeli, you can easily extrapolate future gross revenues and gross billings should substantially rise in 2014. In addition to these acquisitions, management is moving in the right direction by aggressively reinvesting in Groupon's mobile expansion to grow the company's revenues and expand their footprint. CEO Lefkofsky has borrowed a page from Jeff Bezos' playbook on market domination -- gain market share and dominate!During a recent interview, Lefkofsky shared part of Groupon's strategy for world dominance. Management plans to turn your smartphone into ""a shopping mall in your pocket"" where you can buy just about anything, anywhere, anytime, at an unbeatable price. Lefkofsky wants consumers to ""Groupon it,"" not ""Google it."" Mobile e-commerce is exploding beyond imagination and Groupon is the largest mobile e-commerce company in the world.During the conference call, CEO Lefkofsky said, ""our value proposition has never been stronger."" Let's take a look at some of the highlights shared during the conference call by Groupon's CEO.The Q4 HighlightsThe AssessmentAfter sitting down with Groupon management for an in depth review yesterday, Deutsche Bank analyst, Ross Sandler, reiterated a BUY rating on Groupon with a $12 price target. He fully expects Q1 2014 to see acceleration. He went on to say:Northland Captial analyst, Darren Aftahi, reiterated an Outperform rating on Groupon and set a $14.00 price target as the firms new price target, a buck lower than their previous target.Wunderlich Securities analyst, Blake Harper, maintained their BUY rating with a $13 price target.Wells Fargo maintained an Outperform rating on Groupon and believes $11 or $12 is a reasonable price target.Wells Fargo analyst Trisha Dill went on to say that Groupon is making the ""right long-term changes in the business model,"" and believes that Groupon will once again outperform in Q1, which in my opinion is most likely a low-balled estimate.The OpportunityIdentifying buying opportunities is key to profitability. In the case of Groupon, the worst case scenario was suggested by RBC with a ultra bearish $7 price target that failed to materialize. Investors eagerly rushed in at the $8 range buying up oversold shares of Groupon. Going forward I suspect to see a choppy but steady appreciation in the share price until the $10 range. The $10 to $12 range will be driven by Q1 results.Groupon management has been strategically repurchasing their stock during 2013. CFO Jason Child reported that the company has repurchased 4.4 million shares totaling $47 million or approximately $10.68 per share. There remains $253 million under the existing buyback plan. With shares currently trading in this oversold range of $8 to $10, I suspect that CEO Lefkofsky is aggressively repurchasing shares on the open market at the current discounted price.Getting back to innovations, Groupon has developed a new widget based email system called ""Mindstorm"" that is expected to enhance revenues. Groupon believes the new enhancements could double or triple revenues in a single email:ConclusionI believe Groupon is trading at a very attractive discount. The company is on track for continued growth in 2014 and beyond. The negativity surrounding Groupon is unwarranted. Remember, headlines move stocks, but visionaries build companies. Get the details, get the facts, and do your own research.Disclosure: I am long GRPN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The stock closed Friday at $7.09, and the shares are down 40% year-to-date. But this has all of the makings of an overreaction. The way I see it; Groupon hasn't done anything deserving of this punishment, at least not to the extent that its results have swayed that drastically from other momentum growth stories.Recall, in the February quarter, the company did beat earnings estimates by 2 cents, posting adjusted earnings of 4 cents per share. This is while revenue rose slightly above 20% to $768.4 million from the previous year, which beat estimates of $718 million by 7%.The stock got pummeled because the company issued worse-than-expected first-quarter guidance. While citing plans to spend more to advertise its online marketplace, management projected a loss of 2 cents to 4 cents per share for the current quarter, which was below analyst estimates.Investors got spooked, to put it mildly, and analysts didn't help matters with their panic. Consider that Groupon's guidance was in accordance with the company trying to execute what analysts believed the company needed to do to remain viable. These steps include international expansion and mobile monetization. But these moves will cost money. Yet, when the company issued the decline in profits due to higher costs, it was seen as ""mismanagement."" Groupon can't seem to win.The company will report first-quarter results Tuesday. The street will be looking for a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $738.4 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue increase of 23%. Estimates have come down slightly following weaker-than-expected results from other online/internet companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). But there is no fear that either Amazon and eBay are bad businesses. The way I see it Groupon is in select company.But the company is seen as lacking the ability to create new markets. The concern is that Groupon can only operate and service existing markets, which is true. But Groupon is in no worse shape than it was, say, five years ago. There were always threats that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which once made a $6 billion bid for Groupon, would develop a platform to kill off the company. That has yet to happen.There has been talk that Amazon, which owns a stake in rival Living Social, will build up its capabilities to put Groupon out of business. That hasn't happened either. Now the ""new threat"" is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It seems Facebook is a threat to everybody. But the point is, Groupon has posted incredible growth despite these constant fears. And it's time that investors/analysts stop treating this company as anything less than a legitimate business - one that is working to develop/strengthen its global positioning.Consider, one of the most popularly cited bearish arguments against Groupon is its minority stake in Chinese competitor Life Media Ltd. Analysts have used the phrase ""burning through millions of dollars in cash"" to describe Groupon's investment in Life Media. When in fact, if we were to adjust out the one-time charge of $85.5 million related to Life Media, Groupon actually earned a profit.By contrast, Facebook, which has spent billions in various companies that go beyond its core social capabilities, is seen as ""thinking outside the box."" Groupon is clearly operating under a double standard. As noted, Groupon's management sees Life Media as a way to expand the company's lack of global positioning, which has also been a bearish topic. We can't have it both ways.It remains to be seen to what extent these shares recover on Tuesday following the results. But I don't expect they will get any worse. To the extent that the company can show a strong number in areas like gross billings, which has grown in North America and in the EMEA region, the stock should do well.With these shares still down significantly, I would be a buyer here ahead of earnings and bet for another overreaction - this time in the other direction. I would not be surprised to see the stock jump 22% to around $9 right after the announcement if Groupon beats its earnings number and offers better guidance. I project these shares to reach $10 by the second half of the year, which is the median target of the analysts covering the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

Groupon is a multinational online deals website which sells discounted vouchers for local products and services. Groupon stock got off to a horrible start after its 2011 IPO, dropping from $28 to lows in the $2 range. However, things were better in 2013 as shares doubled from $5 to $10. This quarter Wall Street is expecting Groupon to report about 12.5% year-over-year growth in revenue. Here's what investors expect from Groupon Thursday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Groupon)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for GRPN to report 2c EPS and $718.67M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 27 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 2c EPS and $719.12M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting GRPN to report in-line with Wall Street on EPS and exceed by a small margin on revenue.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a smaller differential compared to other quarters.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from -1c to 5c EPS and $699.67M to $727.67M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates for GRPN.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market, which could mean less volatility post earnings.This quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 6c to 2c, while the Estimize consensus increased from -1c to 2c. Over the same period of time, Wall Street lowered its revenue forecast from $721.32M to $718.67M while the Estimize consensus increased from $717.14 to $719.12M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising analyst expectation at the end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91 who projects 2c EPS and $717.0M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, BradHewitt91 is rated as the 20th best analyst and is ranked 14th overall among over 3,850 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, BradHewitt91 is expecting Groupon to report in-line with EPS estimates but miss by a small margin on sales.Despite Groupon stock getting off to a dismal start after its 2011 IPO, things were better in 2013. So far in 2014 Groupon stock is down, but a better than expected earnings report demonstrating strong revenue growth could help get things back on track for Groupon. This quarter the target to beat as set by the Estimize.com community is $719.12M in sales.Disclosure: No positions."
2038853,22445,2014-02-21T11:08:47-05:00,,"Let me say it again, as I have said it before, and like I said on my last take on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) (please consider: Revenue Growth Guidance Is King In This Market).Earnings don't matter in this market (surprise, surprise). If they did, many stocks would not be trading at a zillion multiple, as many do today.The name of the game in this market is revenue growth. If you can show 30%-40% revenue growth year-over-year, then for some reason (that I do not understand), the market rewards your stock handsomely (in fact, you make out like a bandit).Having said this, Groupon's results yesterday were not bad. They were not bad compared to what the market expected (they were bad by my metrics). The company earned $0.04 per share (if you exclude items), or about two pennies more than what analysts had forecasted. Revenue was also a little better than expected, about 20% higher year-over-year.However, there were two issues that the market was not particularly happy about. Let's start off with the headline item that many analysts think mattered most, but actually didn't. The company forecasted a loss for Q1 of 2014, when analysts were expecting a profit.Groupon forecasted an adjusted loss of 2-4 cents per share, when the market was expecting a profit of about $0.06 per share. So that's a very big guidance miss. But like I said in the beginning, the market does not really care about profits. And for a stock that was at around $11 a share, a penny here and a penny there makes little difference. Even if the company guided the market with a $0.06 per share profit, to me Groupon is still a very expensive stock.What I think the market didn't like most of all was Q1 cost and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The company expects one-time costs related to the integration of its recent acquisitions as it consolidates Ticket Monster with its Korean business. While the expected revenue from these businesses is expected to be about $50 million, there will also be a $20 million negative impact on adjusted EBITDA.However, this is not the worst of it, if you ask me. See, revenue during Q4 (that surprised to the upside) came in at $768.4 million compared to $638.3 million in Q4 of 2012 (which was good). However, revenue guidance for Q1 of 2014 stands at $710-$760 million.And if you ask why this important, it's because this number is lower q-o-q than Q4 of 2013. In other words, even with $50 million in additional revenue from the company's recent acquisitions, the company will not show any revenue growth.And if you want something even worse than this (yes, there is something worse than no revenue growth), Groupon expects adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be slightly above 2013 levels. I mean no revenue growth is one thing, but no adjusted EBITDA growth either? Analyst Sameet Sinha from B. Riley & Co., for example, was looking for EBITDA to grow more than 30% in 2014.So the question the market is asking itself is this. If anyone is going to pay 6 times sales for any company, the least it can expect from the company is revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Because if the company can't grow these two figures at 30%, what would anyone pay 6 times sales for any stock?The answer is that there is no reason (to pay 6 times), and that's why the stock is tanking and might continue to do so for several dollars more.On that note, RBC Cap's Mahaney cut Groupon to Underperform, with a $7 share price target and $4 downside target. That might be a little bearish even for me, but if we see a major market correction, don't bet against such an outcome.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2049633,20521,2014-02-26T08:48:58-05:00,,"Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN) just cannot catch a break. They expected to turn around a failing business model by bringing in a new CEO, but it hasn't helped much. The company continues to deliver disappointing projections, causing the stock price to fall. They are struggling to find the right mix of offerings and are continuing their experiments with product sales to arrive at a profitable business model.Groupon's FinancialsGroupon's fourth quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $768.4 million, surpassing market expectations of $719.0 million. But growth in revenues has not translated into positive earnings. The company continued to struggle and ended the quarter at break-even, compared with a loss of $0.04 per share reported a year ago and a loss of $0.01 projected by the market.By region, revenues from North America grew 18% and from EMEA grew 43% which offset the 15% decline in revenues from the Rest of the world.Among other operating metrics, at the end of the previous year, active customers increased 9% to 44.9 million with 20.8 million in North America, 14.2 million in EMEA and 9.9 million in Rest of the World. Mobile continued to be a strong driver with 50% of the worldwide transactions coming through mobile devices. During the quarter, their mobile app was downloaded more than 9 million times. They ended the year with revenues growing 10% to $2.6 billion and an adjusted EBITDA of $286.7 million.For the current quarter, Groupon forecast revenues of $710 million-$760 million with EBITDA of $20 million-$40 million. Groupon expects to end the current year with a loss of $0.02-$0.04 per share compared with market projections of earnings of $0.02 per share.Groupon Acquires IdeeliIn a bid to diversify offerings, Groupon recently announced the acquisition of online fashion retailer Ideeli for an estimated $43 million. New York-based Ideeli, founded in 2007, offers flash deals on designer apparel and home décor to its members. The sale was at a significant discount considering that Ideeli had raised $107 million in venture funding so far. Ideeli will continue to operate their independent website and will help Groupon build on the strong demand they were seeing in these retail categories within Groupon Goods. Additionally, they will also be able to leverage Ideeli's mobile and flash sales experience to add to their offerings.Unfortunately for investors, the addition of Ideeli will dilute Groupon's earnings as the company was not making profits at the time of the acquisition. Last year, Ideeli earned $115 million in revenues with an operating loss of $30 million. Groupon has already accounted for this expected loss in the current year's earnings projections.Groupon Launches Self-Service PlatformGroupon's big worry has been their increasing marketing costs. During the current quarter alone, they plan to increase marketing spend by another $25 million. To win more merchants, they have had to deploy a big sales force. Further, since Groupon deals are focused on consumers searching for discounts, it is not very often that merchants return to Groupon to post additional offers. Thus, Groupon's sales force is constantly scouting to add more merchants to their vendor database. Recently though, Groupon has tried to manage these rising costs by offering the merchants a self-service option, Groupon Deal Builder. The online tool lets merchants create their own deals without needing to interact with a sales representative. Groupon steps in only to validate the deal and to arrive at an agreeable commission percentage. This platform is expected to help Groupon get to the really small vendors while controlling some of their sales costs.But the move may be a little too late for the restaurant industry. Recently, Las Vegas based e-commerce platform LiveDeal.com launched their one of a kind web and mobile platform that directly connects local restaurant merchants with the consumers. Restaurants can create offers instantly using Livedeal's intuitive interface that is fully customizable to allow them to choose the times and the number of deals that are given out. Additionally, LiveDeal does not charge restaurants any third party fees as the customer pays the restaurant directly and does not need to route the voucher payment through LiveDeal. LiveDeal is yet to earn revenues, but they have managed to attract restaurants who are tired of the limitations that are placed by Groupon with regards to the number of offers.Groupon's stock is trading at $7.80 with a market capitalization of $5.18 billion. It touched a year high of $12.76 in September last year. The stock price is also significantly below the $20 IPO price it listed at two years ago.Disclosure: No positions"

That was no where more evident than last week when Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) crushed investor hopes again with another disappointing quarterly report.The news wasn't all terrible as revenues jumped 20.4% year over year to $768.4 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $719.0 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by a 63.0% jump in direct revenues, which offset a 2.8% decline in third party and other revenues in the last quarter.And region-wise, revenues from North America and EMEA surged 18.2% and 42.5% year over year, respectively. This more than offset a 15.3% decline in revenues from Rest of the World (Asia-Pacific and Latin America).But guidance was weak and signs of the turnaround got pushed further out as the decline in North American business is not what Wall Street wanted to hear. For this, shares were pummeled 22% to $8 on massive volume of nearly 140 million shares (more than 7X the average).Clear Sailing in Platform and Mobile GrowthGroupon reported that active customers increased 9.0% year over year to 44.9 million, comprising 20.8 million in North America, 14.2 million in EMEA and 9.9 million in Rest of the World.Approximately 50.0% of the worldwide transactions were through mobile devices. Moreover, more than 9.0 million people downloaded Groupon's mobile app during the quarter, which led to a robust mobile business.Murky Waters in NA Comps and Biz DevEarnings outlook for Q1 and FY 2014 were significantly below consensus estimates with an implied FY EBITDA guide of $300mn vs. consensus of nearly $400mn. North America Local billings grew only 1.5% year-over-year over a tough comp a year ago when the company lowered take rates (rev share) to drive billings. But the deceleration from +13% y-o-y growth in Q3 remains a concern.Gross margin plunged 660 basis points (bps) to 49.2% in the quarter due to unfavorable business mix. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $29.7 million compared with $71.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Analyst at Stifel Nicolaus noted that:Groupon's net loss (including stock-based compensation but excluding acquisition-related expenses and impairment charges) was $1.7 million, which was slightly better than a loss of $25.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. But a good chunk of this only came from lower expenses which is not really what Wall Street cares about right now with this company.The Q1 guidance is probably what made investors shoot first last week. Adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $20 million and $40 million, below the prior consensus estimate of $93 million, in part because of negative contributions from its recent acquisitions and additional marketing investments.Dead Calm Before the Storm?I met a former employee of Groupon last week (before earnings) and asked him what he thought about the growth of their businesses going forward. I couldn't get an answer I was satisfied with as I watched the stock trade above $10. I knew a lot of major Wall Street houses were recently bullish with price targets near $15 so I was mildly interested in the opportunity.But when I read the research reports following the company's quarterly blow-up, I wasn't any more sure what to make of this business -- except that earnings estimates, growth projections, and price targets were coming down.Many analysts believe Groupon is well positioned to gain from the rising e-Commerce spending on mobile devices, a profitable domestic market and an under-penetrated international market. These opportunities can continue to drive top-line growth, especially with increased traction in mobile.However, others believe that while the negative impact of increasing investments on profitability is a temporary factor, the company's decision to reduce focus on China is a long-term negative.And Macquarie analysts talked about facets of the business that seemed important but which eluded my understanding:Finally, the company continues to face significant competition not only from the stalwarts like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but also from small companies like LiveDeal.Bottom line: While the turn-around seemed promising, there are enough headwinds and uncertainties here to stay away.

2039993,23479,2014-02-21T16:01:34-05:00,,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock fell over 15% in trading following the company's Q4 2013 earnings announcement. Even though the results were generally good, the outlook didn't appeal to the investors. The key message was that the company is still trying to find the right strategy to create a long-term sustainable business, and therefore, certain investments might put short-term pressure on its profits. We believe that the stock price corrected itself to some extent to better reflect the reality. While gross billings grew in North America and the EMEA region, the rest of the world saw a decline. Even growth in the domestic market is not as brisk as before. Groupon needs to cut down on irrelevant emails, focus on activating mobile subscribers and reduce the number of ""null"" searches by enhancing its catalog of deals.We are reviewing our price estimate for Groupon in light of recent earnings and will have an update ready soon. Our current price estimate for the company stands at $6.25, implying a discount of about 25% to the market price.Groupon Still Finding The Right MixThe biggest improvement that Groupon can make to its service right now is increasing its relevance and utility. This implies that customers should be able to get desired deals at or near the time when they intend to use them. Currently, the company sends its subscribers over 250 million emails everyday and a large number of them are irrelevant. Also, emails tend to be less engaging and Groupon would be better off directing its subscribers to its app and website. The company is already doing this, which is evident from the fact that its mobile app witnessed more than 33 million downloads in 2013, and mobile accounts for almost half of its total transactions now. [1] Also, it is encouraging subscribers to browse through its website and find the deals in real time. However, far too many of them are still not aware of this facility and instead rely on emails. This suggests that Groupon needs to ramp up its marketing which may put some pressure on its margins in the near term.The user experience can also be affected by ""null"" search results, which are only going to reduce with time as the company gets more merchants to its website. In order to build a sustainable business, Groupon will need to ensure that its customers keep coming back for more. This can only happen by increasing the relevance, flexibility and utility of deals. The revenue growth will suffer temporarily as users shift from email marketing to mobile app and real time browsing, but from a long-term perspective, this is the right way to go. The company could try to speed up the time it takes to activate a new customer who downloads its app. This will again require higher marketing spending, thus creating near-term cost pressure.Groupon's focus is rightly changing from customer acquisition to customer retention. Finding the right mix of deals, take rate and marketing strategy is going to take some time.Disclosure: No positions."
1984991,38201,2014-01-31T12:16:18-05:00,,"Groupon (GRPN) has been looking to expand its offerings to online travel and restaurant reservation service and after venturing into online coupons last month, Groupon diversified into flash sales with the acquisition of flash sale website Ideeli for $43 million. Ideeli offers men's and women's clothing, accessories and home decors in a flash sales format. This format allows people to buy products at a discount price but only for a limited time. Groupon will gain access to Ideeli's 6 million customers through this acquisition. Although the company was operating into losses of $30 million in 2013 with $115 million in gross revenue, analysts backed Groupon for buying Ideeli at a good price.Fashion flash sales rose to popularity post 2008 when major brands had a lot of unsold inventory, but as inventory fell, companies faced trouble offering such deals. Thus, this format lost momentum in the past few years, but it is unlikely that the online flash market for fashion garments will disappear completely as fashion garments are still one of the top growing categories of e-commerce. The combined offline and online flash sales market is $40 billion today. The major companies operating in the online fashion flash market include Fab.com, Ideeli, Gilt Groupe and Zulily (ZU). Zulily recently completed a successful IPO on November 15, 2013, where the share price increased by 87.5% on the first day. Unlike Ideeli, Zulily has been a profitable business, though the net income stood at just $0.42 million over revenue of $438.7 million for the first nine months of 2013. The company has a strong reputation in mobile commerce with 45% of the orders coming through mobile in the third quarter of 2013. Ideeli isn't far behind in mobile, and it achieved triple digit growth in revenue from mobile devices between 2012 and 2013. Groupon has focused on mobile segment with several initiatives last year and could possibly use Ideeli's strong mobile presence to build expertise.The acquisition will be particularly useful in Groupon's new initiative to help small mom-and-pop retail stores that are unable to sell their merchandise at full prices. Groupon would inform customers about any sale/discount at a nearby local store. With the help of Ideeli, Groupon could aid these stores in selling their apparel at a discount to customers. Through this new initiative, customers could purchase a product from a local store at a discount through either Ideeli or Groupon's website and pick it up later from the local store. The main challenge for the company would be partnering with local stores in different U.S. markets. It is testing the initial phase in Chicago, and if proved successful, it could open up a new set of small retailers to work with. This would eliminate the need of storing and shipping costs. The company incurs significant shipping costs since it offers free shipping for orders above $20 and includes free returns as well. Thus, through this business, Groupon will not only improve its profit margin, but also build up a strong network of retailers across the country.Expanding its hotel offeringsGroupon strengthened its Getaways marketplace and has added more than 20,000 new hotels around the world. With the addition of new hotels, Groupon travelers could discover new hotels in popular destinations and save money on discount deals. In order to attract travelers, Groupon offered a 5% rebate for reservations made at the newly added hotels. The addition of new hotels came from its association with Expedia (EXPE), and Groupon is offering the discount to encourage more users to book through its site.The company is planning to integrate it with its last minute booking app Blink, which it acquired last year. Blink has partnerships with 2,000 hotels, and with the help of this massive addition, Groupon could become the preferred choice for travel booking. Groupon wants to take advantage of the fact that travelers are increasingly using mobile and tablets to book hotels, and usually last-minute booking happens through these mobile devices. Around 7% of all travel bookings in 2013 were made through mobile devices, and they are expected to go up by another 20% in 2014. Groupon integrated Blink into a mobile app, which is available on the Google Play Store and iOS Store to attract more travelers and ramp up hotel bookings.Bottom lineThe past year had been a dream run for Groupon as the share price grew 137% owing to change in leadership the and shift from a push to pull strategy.(Source: YCharts)Last year, the company was rebuilding itself with the change in its strategy and diversifying away from daily deals. This year Groupon is building on its strategy of diversification and strengthening with the acquisitions it completed last year. Though daily deals continue to be its main source of revenue, it is leveraging its vast user base to get into different segments of e-commerce (Flash sales). This year will be an important for Groupon, as it will show whether the company will be able to overcome the declining gross billings and revenue. I remain optimistic about Groupon's fundamentals and recommend buying this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Fusion Research is a team of equity analysts.

2025481,22775,2014-02-17T03:50:25-05:00,,"We believe that Q4 expectations for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) have probably come down in recent days (company guidance calls for $690m-740m revenues and $40m-60m CSOI) following Groupon product head's departure and disappointing earnings/guidelines from Internet peers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Taking into account Groupon's impressive earnings miss track-record, it's no wonder that many investors see the Q4 earnings release as tricky and have decided to take some profits on the stock which is down 11% year-to-date.As far as we are concerned, we believe that there are reasons (which we detail below) to be relatively upbeat about Q4 and/or FY14 even if we would not expect a blowout quarter due to the continuing impacts from Google email changes (sharp decline in email open rates) and the ongoing transition to the Pull model (mobile and marketplace) from Push (emails).In all, Groupon offers in our view an attractive risk/reward heading into Q4 figures, as recent concerns have been well factored in the stock price while an earnings beat is possible and would probably spark a strong positive reaction.Groupon could finally surprise on the upsideThe first reason to be optimistic about Groupon's Q4 is that the local merchants business seems to have been healthy recently as illustrated by Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) solid Q4 figures.But more importantly, we believe that Groupon's new business model is starting to deliver as illustrated by the group's Q3 performance (net income surprised positively with a $2.6m loss vs $14.3m loss expected, on revenues 3% below consensus). Now, more than 50% of North American transactions are sourced via mobile, a catalyst for smoother revenue growth and higher margins going forward. We are therefore confident that North America remained healthy in Q4 thanks to continued mobile traction.But a major catalyst for the stock would be the recovery of its international activities, which have been a drag on Groupon's performances (sharp revenue declines and poor earnings in previous quarters). In our view, they could soon benefit from an accelerating momentum:1/ In EMEA (26% of group revenues), Groupon has been progressing in moving the different platforms onto a single platform, much easier to manage, and in exporting the US business model. The group is also making take rates investments (i.e. accepts lower fees from merchants) in order to improve merchant selection and customer satisfaction. At some point, growth in the region could get back in the black and, in a blue-sky scenario, converge towards that of North America. The downside risk is pretty limited here, while the upside on group revenue and margins could be significant.2/ RoW (13% of group revenues), which was heavily loss-making, operated close to breakeven in Q3 thanks to operations streamlining and cost-savings initiatives. Assuming continued efficiencies and a better top-line in Q4 thanks to recent investments in Asia and Latin America, RoW could surprise on the upside in Q4In all, the healthy US business and a better execution in international markets are likely to enable Groupon to significantly improve its daily deals revenues and earnings soon, potentially as soon as Q4.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

2028791,23479,2014-02-18T14:58:38-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will release its Q4 2013 earnings on February 20. We expect strong growth in billings in North America even though the company's international business continues to remain under doubt. The U.S. holiday season saw large discounts being offered by retailers, and Groupon was no exception. The company offered $100 million in Groupon Bucks to its subscribers on Black Friday, and a host of deals helped it deliver its biggest holiday weekend ever. The results from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) suggest that the key e-commerce companies grew their sales faster than the overall e-commerce market, and we expect Groupon to benefit from this trend. Nevertheless, the company needs to answer a key question: Can it successfully turnaround its business in international markets, which have become increasingly important for the U.S. retailers? To understand this, we look forward to the change in international take rate, billings as well as margins.Our price estimate for Groupon stands at $6.25, implying a discount of about 40% to the market price.Groupon Has Made It Easier For Its Subscribers To Access DealsGroupon has improved its website design and has integrated search with its mobile apps, thus making it convenient for subscribers to search for deals and explore its marketplace. This is well aligned with its core strategy of focusing on 'pull' rather than 'push,' where the latter refers to marketing deals through emails. Given that a big chunk of customers has shifted to mobile for online purchases, it is inevitable for the company to continue re-inventing itself on this platform. The results have been encouraging as more than 50% of Groupon transactions are now happening over mobile platform that primarily includes smartphones and tablets. The company mentioned in one of its press releases that more than 55% of transactions in North America were completed on mobile devices during the holiday weekend that spanned four days. During this period, the billings jumped 30% over the comparable period in 2012.Groupon's business in North America saw growth of over 35% in the first nine months of 2013. We expect fourth quarter results to reinforce our belief that the business will continue to improve in the region in the near term. In the long term, Groupon will need to revive its international business and consolidate its position in newly acquired and launched businesses including hotel bookings, ticket sales, coupons and physical goods. This can add meaningful value to its stock. For instance, the online coupon market in North America stands at $4 billion annually, and the total coupon market is somewhere around $28 billion, indicating that in-store coupons still account for the majority of the industry's revenues. The company can tap this opportunity and potentially add 15% to its value if it is able to grab even 10% share of the online coupons market. This will imply incremental revenues of close to $400-$500 million over the next few years.Disclosure: No positions"
1973531,34541,2014-01-28T13:49:03-05:00,,"Having been a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) user for the past two years, I am inclined to go against investor sentiment and take a long term position that I believe has a chance of paying off significantly.Flash-sales have become popular recently since Groupon pioneered the method. Many smaller operations have mimicked the method of sales which encouraged skeptics and short-sellers to isolate that factor as their justification for shorting the shares. However, I believe that fact is tangential to the larger story of what will allow Groupon to continue its growth trajectory over the long term.The timed sales aspect is an impetus to get consumers to act more quickly but that alone is not what makes Groupon successful. It is a necessity more than anything and not the reason why consumers are there in the first place. What I believe is the key to Groupon's success is that many consumers, myself included like inside deals. As a member of both Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Wal-Mart's Sam's Club (NYSE:WMT), I can relate to the fact that there are items that tens of millions in America like to purchase wholesale. When buying products wholesale, one is agreeing to buy bulk for a better price - in advance.Although they are also increasing their tangible product sales as demonstrated by their recent acquisition of online flash sales fashion retailer Ideeli, the major part of their deals are in services and other intangibles. From that perspective, Groupon could be regarded as a Costco - for services. It allows consumers to obtain a special price on all kinds of entertainment, dining, vacation packages, auto-repair, carpet cleaning etc.In the sense that Groupon has pioneered a new way of conducting discount retail with an existing medium, it reminds me of the beginning of HSN & QVC. Bud Lowell Paxson took a broadcast medium, one that had existed for decades and monetized it in an innovative way. Products had been sold on television before but not in the way HSN did it with timed-sales. My impression when those networks came on the scene was ambivalence. I never dreamed that so many millions of consumers would become obsessed to the degree they have, turning television shopping into a multi-billion dollar industry.A year ago, I suspected that Groupon might be an acquisition target for John Malone's Liberty Media, thinking it might be an extension of a QVC run by Dr. John C. Malone or HSN. The flash-sales or timed sales aspect of Groupon has some similarities to the way home shopping works on television; so I had envisioned some possible synergies and cross-promotion benefits between the two businesses.With HSN (HSNI) at a mere $3 billion market capitalization, it would no longer be feasible considering Groupon's current valuation. As Groupon reportedly turned down a $5.3 billion offer even before going public and currently valued at $7 billion, I believe we are at the floor at this point. Although Malone's Liberty Media (LMCA) could feasibly make a deal, I no longer think it would be likely to happen.As we have seen with Amazon.com, companies that are early movers and gain critical-mass can dominate sectors for decades even if there is little barrier to entry to their market. Groupon can potentially be to services, what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is to merchandise. Amazon would certainly like a piece of the action as evidenced by its investment in Living Social, however, there is room for competition and I believe Amazon is spread thin in its many endeavors (like competing with Netflix).Groupon has a jump start, strengthening brand and is in a class practically by itself. The growth potential in the US alone is so profound that my focus is on execution of strategy and their gaining critical mass - more than guessing or quibbling over a few pennies per share at this point.Out of a $16 trillion annual GDP, Arts & Entertainment account for $600 billion in annual spending in the US alone. That's just one segment and does not account for others in which Groupon participates.Groupon is currently operating in 44 countries and based upon the trillion dollars plus annual expenditures the segment represents, I'm looking for a potential three-fold increase in market cap over the next two years and believe it can continue solid growth for a decade.If Groupon dominates the way I suspect they will, a five-fold increase in investment could be achieved before a three-fold increase in stock price if one uses the LEAPS. Option premiums are rather high these days on the greatest performers of the past year. If you want to speculate on further revenue and earnings surprises on companies like Netflix, Tesla, LinkedIn or Yelp, you are going to pay high premiums for the LEAPS. I have already made my returns on half of those and am looking for the next such opportunity - before I have to pay a high premium.Groupon is not a little darling among options traders as of yet. The time-value premiums I have paid for Groupon leaps are so diminutive that it makes little sense to buy the shares. I have been purchasing the January 2016 Calls with the $5 Strike price. As you can see from the quote below from the CBOE, the options are in the money by more than $5.00 a share, yet remarkably, one can buy two years of time at the $5 strike price for just a little over a buck per contract.   That is the kind of deal I look for as a value investor who occasionally uses options. My thesis is totally fundamental. I care nothing about what anyone's chart says, have no momentum concerns and am just an investor who believes this company is going to execute well under new leadership and grow it's market cap substantially.This has been a year of the comeback. As we have seen Facebook stage a rally after a year languishing far below its IPO price, if we see Groupon reach its $20 IPO price from 2011, these contracts would be in the money enough to take them from$600 to $1,500 without accounting for time value. It could go substantially higher if this stock comes back in favor and the options holder has over a year left in time value.There is plenty to discuss as I have read the contentions of naysayers, including one advanced years ago by a Wharton professor who wrote that the business model is doomed to fail. I disagree but understand the line of reasoning. There are plenty of theories to debate that were not addressed here and I look forward to doing so in the discussion certain to ensue below in the comments section.Disclosure: I am long GRPN, .

1910051,58981,2013-12-20T14:15:38-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is on an absolute tear. Since closing at 10.14 on December 11th, it has risen as high as 11.70 in trading on 12/20/13. This is an increase of roughly 13% and has the stock trading near the consensus 52-week target. I'm thinking it's time to say ""Thank You"" for the Christmas present and take some money off the table if you are long Groupon, and hold off establishing a position if you are considering the stock.The Case for Groupon Being Ahead of ItselfAs earlier stated, Groupon has a consensus target of 11.82 per Yahoo! Finance, which is just pennies away. The momentum behind Groupon has pushed the stock up rapidly over the past few trading sessions with only one obvious driver. The only event that is driving this gain is one analyst initiating coverage with a favorable recommendation and a price target of $13. But there doesn't seem to be any fundamental changes in the past ten days that would drive the stock to the target and cause it to go higher. Remember, analysts are almost always favorable, and while Mr. Aftahi of Northland Capital Markets is entitled to his opinion this is one analyst report out of 24. Are all of them going to raise their estimates with little change in the underlying business model of Groupon? The only other news of late is Groupon rescinded a stock offer due to a clerical error made on their part, and small announcements regarding a deal in Canada and other incremental business developments. The usual amount of chatter both positive and negative is ongoing. Return on equity and other key statistics are negative and no ""game-changer"" event has occurred other than one analyst report. My impression is this is a ""hot money"" trade and likely the only gains in the stock for a few months have now been made.The Case for Groupon Being an Investment TrapGroupon does not compete in an exclusive market, nor does Groupon have a compelling niche in any of its core businesses. While fellow SA contributor R. J. Chopin provides a favorable and thorough analysis of Groupon, I differ with his opinion that Groupon becoming synonymous with ""deal"" is a positive development. Sure the Groupon World Marketplace is a good diversification strategy, but I do not believe Groupon can grow fast enough by stressing cheaper and cheaper prices. At these multiples, the time needed to reap gains would likely mean holding the stock for years.While Groupon is surviving, they do not make sense at these multiples as an investment and the trade/short-term play is critiqued above. Groupon primarily competes for price-conscience consumers in most cases, nearly guaranteeing a ""race to the bottom"" mentality that cannot help margins. With a negative profit margin already, where is the turnaround point? The stock also has a forward P/E of 46 based on possibly rosy forecasts. Sure, Groupon continues to develop and possibly even reinvent itself, but why is this compelling to an investor at these prices? Does it become a deep-discount online merchant first and foremost, with the deal-site nature of the company fading? Then it would compete even more with established merchants such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Sure, Amazon is also trading at high multiples and near its target price but it has a mature and proven model and the ""name brand"". As an investor, does either stock have a ""moat""-no, but Amazon definitely has greater market penetration.In Groupon's defense, they do have a large cash position (over $1B) and are getting costs under control. However, I don't think Groupon makes sense as a long-side trade or investment at this price after the run-up it has made in the past five days. Disagree? I look forward to your comments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1941111,21044,2014-01-13T05:09:19-05:00,,"Investment ThemeAs the CEO of Living Social departs, Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) primary competitor is left without its leader while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the largest single holder of Living Social with a 35% holding, is once again looking for a way to break into Flash Sales. According to Bloomberg, Amazon has continuously been writing down the value of its holding. Now at $15mm, it was most recently at $25mm as early as June and $192mm two years prior. For Amazon, that's a decimal error. For Groupon, it suggests the #2 and primary competitor to Groupon is losing the battle of attrition, making Groupon the undisputed king of online flash sales. Any talk of 'flash sales' being a passing fad is not only premature but overly simplistic and extremely short-sighted. Groupon is not just another e-commerce company, it's an entirely new and revolutionary way of conducting commerce. Moreover, Groupon empowers local small business merchants in ways never before possible, thus contributing to this nation's core philosophy of supporting small business.Company DescriptionGroupon is the predominant Flash Sales commerce platform, sometimes referred to as online coupons, although the latter is a poor description of what Groupon does. Interested retailers now have to 'apply' to be listed on Groupon's platform, indicating how effectively Groupon has ingratiated itself in the mind of small retailers.Thesis & Catalyst For Groupon, Inc.As Groupon consolidates its position as the leader in flash sales, it has begun an aggressive acquisition strategy aimed at a lateral strategic expansion of its primary platform. Management has been openly communicating an expansion of its strategy into mobile and local offerings. This expansion of its platform involves technology one would usually see from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) such as contextual search, emphasis on mobile, and eventual broader expansion into discounted 'productized services'. This will continue to solidify Groupon as a destination platform, connecting engaged consumers searching for local deals and merchants looking for a broader channel to promote local offerings. With a possible ""throwing in of the towel"" by Living Social, coupled with an acquisitive Groupon, 2014 is likely to present investors with an expanding EPS and a rising stock price. Perhaps even a positive P.E. In the near term, I expect Groupon to be at $14-$15, a 30% gain from its current price.ValuationAt the current market cap of $7.7B, Groupon shows signs of the early internet hype when stocks with no reported earnings were being valued at astronomical prices. However, in this particular case, the first mover advantage of Groupon, the widening competitive edge, signs of trouble from Living Social, and Groupon's aggressive acquisition spree suggest a fundamental shift is taking place in how institutional investors value Groupon. There is a huge ""goodwill premium"" for achieving 'First Mover'. An additional premium is added when that position is consolidated, especially when the number two is backed by a giant like Amazon, as is the case with Living Social.Company ManagementOne of the positives of this company pertains to the fact that over 65% of the public float is locked up in institutional hands. Historically, institutions and insiders are long-term holders and therefore, they lock up their blocks of stock. An institutional ownership ratio above 90% would be problematic because of the risk of a sudden decision to unwind by one of those institutions. But at 65%, it's more likely for ownership to increase than decrease, especially in 2014 as Groupon becomes the go-to platform for consumers during a time when the tablet becomes the most important point of commerce for the internet.Competitive LandscapeTo many, flash sales operators like Groupon present very little barrier to entry. However, once this has become the 'go-to platform' among mobile consumers, there is almost no chance for a new comer to achieve traction. If that were possible, we'd have seen Google and Amazon succeed where instead they failed. If Groupon continues to localize the experience and thereby improve the value-add to advertisers on their platform, much like Google, advertisers will prefer Groupon over other platforms for their coupon sales.Revenue & EPS OutlookAlthough the company continues to report losses ever since the IPO, 2014 is likely to result in Groupon's first profitable quarter as it expands laterally into multiple retail verticals.Variant ViewA sudden and aggressive expansion by Google into flash sales and localized coupons, which isn't a stretch of the imagination considering Google already has the technology could put a tiny player up against the largest localized advertising company in the world. Concurrently, the present acquisitiveness of Groupon may result in difficulty integrating which will distract management at a time the company could ill afford any distractions. Key aspects of a Global Macro market operators overall analysis involve quantitative, fundamental and evidence based technical analysis.

1907731,21543,2013-12-19T12:29:00-05:00,,"Will Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) be the rising star that shines in your portfolio or the one that got away? Is it possible that Groupon is on track to become the real deal in 2014 and beyond, or will you regret owning the stock? Before you answer, let's take another look at what's driving Groupon.When Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) IPO debuted in 1997 as an $18 per share online bookseller with $15.7 million in sales, few envisioned today's $70 billion in annual revenues or its current $384 share price. Had you bought into Jeff Bezos's vision and invested $1,000 in Amazon's IPO, your investment would be worth about $229,000 today, says Mashables's Zoe Fox. That's an astounding $14,312 per year for the past 16 years on a $1,000 investment.When Amazon stumbled in 2001 and the stock plunged to $6, Bezos went to work partnering with retailers. The idea was genius. A one-stop portal where consumers shop for just about anything at a ""sale price"" cheaper than the brick and mortar outlets. Now I am not talking about Amazon, but Groupon -- let me explain.Groupon's partnerships with retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, small business and international sellers under Groupon's World Marketplace is reaching local customers, but not with a ""sale price"" like Amazon, but with the ""deal price"" that is usually a 50% discount. Deal-lovers know value and simply cannot resist the incredible savings, especially when it pops up on their cell phones. It's kind of like a sales clerk showing up at your front door with a new $1,000 TV for $500. Your immediate reaction is to grab the ""deal"" and say, ""If you come across any other ""deals"" please let me know!""The name Groupon has become synonymous with the ""deal."" Think ""deal,"" think Groupon. Groupon's branding strategy has embedded in the psyche of every deal-loving shopper that Groupon is the one-stop destination for unparalleled and unbeatable value. The physiological effects of scoring a huge discount deal results in deal-lovers experiencing intense feelings of satisfaction and enthusiasm each time they purchase a Groupon deal. Because Groupon's half-price deals offer unbeatable value, the deal triggers the release of Dopamine in the shopper's brain which causes the shopper to feel extremely happy. The more deals they buy, the more they save, the happier they feel. The entire experience is so exciting that deal-lovers can't wait to flood Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) with tweets, post their deal on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and text the link to all their friends. The enthusiasm is not only contagious but addictive. The Groupon deal makes every buyer an instant winner.Now if you doubt what I am saying, ask 2 or 3 people this question; ""Have you heard about the half-price deals at Groupon?"" You will be hard pressed to find someone with a pulse that hasn't.Financial HighlightsMore upgrades for Groupon rolled in this December (10th and 11th) as Morgan Stanley raised their price target to $15 and Wells Fargo analyst Trisha Dill, upgraded her price target between $13 to $14 with an Overweight rating:Dill believes Groupon is just ""scratching the surface"" in mobile e-commerce and poised for more growth. A recent Wells Fargo survey of Groupon's users seemed to be the catalyst for Dill's upgrade along with several metrics that indicate competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon will have little or no impact on Groupon's subscribers or its revenues. This confirms what I said earlier; Groupon owns the ""deal."" Think ""deal,"" think Groupon.In just a few years Groupon has grown revenues to $2.5 billion, and early indications for Q4 2013 are leaning to record breaking results thanks to Groupon's new mobile app and global expansion. Groupon's management believes that revenues of $100 billion could be obtainable in the future, but failed to qualify ""future."" I am less optimistic on this point and believe future revenues could double or triple over the next 1 to 2 years and we could see Groupon's share price eventually return to the $20 to $25 range.In a previous article, 7 Reasons Groupon Is A Buy, I detailed the compelling fundamentals that are driving Groupon's growing revenues. Here's the abridged version:Navigating The ChartThe chart below forecast important technical indicators. Keep a close watch on the $12.67 breakout. We should trade into the new channel soon before breaking through the $12.76 resistance.ConclusionRecent headlines maintain a positive outlook on Groupon as shares continue to rise. Here's some of the sentiment surrounding Groupon.As 2013 comes to a close, it has become impossible to avoid the Groupon question. Will Groupon be 2014's must own stock? Analysts' predictions have Groupon trading in the teens in the near future. Buying now may prove to be the wisest strategy as it appears the price will only continue to rise ahead of 2013 Q4's financial report.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

2006431,22445,2014-02-09T06:29:29-05:00,,"While the social stock craze is still in full force, Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) quarterly report is a stark reminder that not everything in the social space is rosy. Because when investors pay a huge multiple for a stock, they expect everything to be perfect. ""Not only should Caesar's wife be trustworthy, she also needs to be above suspicion,"" said Julius Caesar some two thousand years ago.In Twitter's case, even though the company beat analyst expectations, shares tanked by 12%, partly because Twitter said it only had 241 million monthly active users at the end of the quarter. And that's something the market did not take kindly, because the company only gained nine million new users since its last quarter, when it registered 232 million monthly active users.I mean I could make a case for not buying Twitter, as I have (Stocks You Should Not Own For 2014), but I think this market does not care one bit about earnings or other fundamental metrics as I am aware of them. The only thing this market recognizes -- and cares about -- is revenue growth and user growth. If you can't bring home both, then you get the axe (for 1-2 days that is until everyone forgets about the incident).LinkedIn (LNKD) is another stock that met expectations, but fell short in future revenue guidance. In LinkedIn's case, the market has so fine-tuned the price of the stock to its future expectations (future revenue), that when there is a slight deviation, then the market re-prices the stock. In LinkedIn's case, the repricing still has a long way to go if you ask me.Now let's talk about Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Groupon will report on February 20. Groupon has disappointed several times over the past year and its revenue has been stagnant, but the market has been giving the benefit of a doubt to the new management. However, the benefit of a doubt only goes so far if Groupon is not able to bring home the revenue bacon. Because as far as EPS is concerned, no one is really expecting much.Groupon is expected to make $0.09 per share this year and $0.25 for 2014. The current trailing P/E is about 100 and the future 12 month forward P/E is about 40. So the stock is not at $11 a share because of the earnings picture. My hunch is that the market is betting on a revenue growth surprise figure.So while the reported non-GAAP EPS will be important, even more important will be if the company can surprise the market with better than expected revenue for the quarter, and hopefully, better revenue guidance than what the market is already expecting. For 2013, the market is modeling $2.53 billion in revenue and $2.9 billion for 2014.My hunch is that it should not be very difficult for the company to surprise the market in the current quarter as far as revenue is concerned. The company is experimenting with Flash-sales and Online travel bookings, and it has also started a service called Groupon Reserve that lets users reserve a table at a restaurant for free and offers up to 40 percent off the total bill.So the company is actually doing stuff, even though revenue has been flat over the past year, because the coupon business has no barriers to entry and competition is intense.So should you buy Groupon at these prices?I believe the answer has a lot to do with future revenue guidance. If management can give the market something slightly better than what it already expects -- even if the current quarter is not that rosy -- I think the stock can go higher.In addition, there is one minor detail that might save the stock, even if it does miss the current quarter and even if guidance does not surprise.Contrary to Twitter and LinkedIn that trade at a stratospheric Price/Sales ratio (LinkedIn at 19 and Twitter at 14 based on 2014 revenue guidance), Groupon's Price/Sales ratio is about 2.5 trailing. Now that's not a low number in my book, but it's a much smaller number than many other stocks out there.And the higher the Price/Sales ratio, the more sensitive a stock is to a revenue miss or to lower guidance. So because Groupon has a relatively low Price/Sales ratio, unless it misses big time on the revenue front, the chance of the stock correcting is small.Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things that I don't like about the company, especially the fact that it can't make any money because of its very high SG&A expenses. However, seeing how this market is behaving and how it totally ignores bottom line EPS in the social space, the market might ignore a miss in EPS, as long as revenue is guided higher.So if revenue for the current quarter comes in a little better than expected, and future revenue guidance is also just a little better than expectations, then I really think Groupon can go higher, even if I really don't think it deserves so.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1893821,56922,2013-12-12T02:33:10-05:00,,"Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) is an e-commerce company based in Chicago, Illinois. It essentially operates as an intermediary between merchants and consumers. Groupon benefits merchants by making their businesses more marketable while the consumers get added flexibility in terms of cost and quality. By leveraging the company's global relationships and scale, Groupon offers deals on the best things to eat, see, do, and buy in 48 countries. The company distributes its deals through three channels; email, mobile platforms and groupon.com. It uses emails to distribute deals to subscribers based on their location and personal preferences. The company's website offer deals under the headings of Local, Goods, Getaways, Reserve, Freebies and Gift Shop.Local section offers deals from local merchant partners across multiple categories, including food and drink, events and activities, beauty and spa, fitness, health, home and auto, shopping, and education. Goods Section offer customers to find deals across multiple product lines including electronics, sports etc.Getaways section features offers from travel partners, including hotels, airfare and package deals covering both domestic and international travel.Reservation section enables the customers to get reservations in high-end restaurants. This service covers many restaurants across US states.Freebies section brings to customers attention coupons, prom codes and giveaways offered by different brands.Gift shop section offers gift ideas and deal under number of classifications.There are around 65000 active deals being offered with 65 million local merchant worldwide. In the trailing twelve months, Groupon generated around 60%, 27% and 13% of its revenue from North America, EMEA and the rest of the world respectively.Market PerformanceThe shares of Groupon are listed on NASDAQ and are currently trading at around $9. The valuation appreciated by 76% in the year to date.The increase in valuations can mainly be attributed to the year-on-year improvement in revenue and EPS. EPS has been negative in the past few years but is expected to recover in the future, hence the growth in valuations. The valuation touched $12 in the third quarter, but since then it has fallen to around $9. This could be because of the Wall Street estimates falling from $0.5 to $0.1 in just three months. The anticipated decline in gross billing may also be a cause for the performance in the last couple of months.Future Prospects And CatalystsMobile E-CommerceThe use of smartphones and tablets is booming. People use phones more often than personal computers. Hence the shift towards mobile commerce could be a ticket to growth for Groupon. However, there are certain things that come in to play and simply entry into the mobile market cannot be taken as a guarantee for success. Factors like competitors position, quality of deals and ease of use (apps) can play a significant role in the future of the company in mobile commerce. According to a Groupon official, mobile customers spend 50% more than desktop customers. The company reported that over 40% of its transactions occurred through a mobile device in September 2013 and Groupon app's downloads have exceeded 60 million.Groupon's app is ranked #44, while eBay is ranked #40; eBay's market cap is around $67 billion. Being so close to the popularity level of such a large company, it is evident that Groupon has a strong opportunity to grow in mobile e-commerce. Moreover, the app also includes features that enable the saving of credit card info and mailing addresses, streamlining the payments for future transactions. This minor detail could yet prove to be the difference because consumers are inclined to favor easy and less repetitive processes. It is safe to assume that Groupon has positive future prospects in the mobile e-commerce industry.The Pull StrategyThe company is shifting its strategic course from an email/push to a search/pull approach. Instead of pushing emails to potential customer's inboxes, the company is now focusing on monitoring the search patterns of the website and app users and securing deals with merchants based on the search analytics result. During the current quarter, 75% of merchant contracts signed in North America opted to feature in the pull marketplace with a monthly recurring deal. The pull strategy has helped Groupon to manage its costs effectively by reducing marketing expenses over the years. Marketing expense, as a percentage of sales, has declined from a peak of 93% in 2010 to 9.12% in the second quarter of 2013. So with the pull strategy the company is managing to reduce overall costs. The reduction in costs will impact the EPS of the company and an improving trend will be seen in future partially due to cost reductions and partially because of more successful deals as a result of focused deal offerings thanks to the Pull strategy. All in all this strategy will assist EPS growth of the company.The Acquisitive StrategyGroupon has been involved in several acquisitions in the recent past in order to capitalize on the growth factor that mobile e-commerce has to offer. It recently concluded transactions to acquire Ticket Monster, Blink Booking and SideTour.Ticket Monster is one of the leading e-commerce websites in Korea. Email purchases account for less than 10% of Ticket Monster's total sales indicating a healthy direct website customer proportion and, in effect, the popularity of website. No substantial marketing expense (push email) is required and this business model is compatible with the pull strategy of Groupon. Ticket Monster has an annualized run rate of $800 million in billing which translates to around $100 million in added revenue for Groupon. This is an increase of around 4% on the current revenue of the company. Groupon will pay around $260 million for the acquisition of Ticket Monster. $100 million will be paid in cash and the rest offered as class ""A"" common stock. The acquisition of Ticket Monster is expected to grow the earnings and revenues of Groupon.Blink, a European destination for great deals on same-day hotel bookings, was acquired by Groupon to assist their growth in mobile e-commerce. Blink covers over 3000 hotels in 200 European cities. The app, now known as Blink by Groupon, has been downloaded around 650,000+ times across Europe. This acquisition will also complement and contribute to the future growth of Groupon.The SideTour acquisition was also completed by Groupon in the current year. SideTour is a marketplace that helps people discover, book and host great local activities. Basically the company is providing a platform for event/tour organizers and their clients. People post ""experiences,"" i.e. description of events they will organize with a price tag. This is a startup business, yet it has great future growth prospects. It's free to have your experience included on SideTour. Hosts set the prices of their experiences, and SideTour takes a 30% fee on completed transactions. The point to note here is that the company takes a fee without being involved in organizing and planning the event. It saves time and cost; as long as the company controls the quality of the experiences posted and ensures their successful execution. Groupon has the opportunity to capitalize on the innovative and cost-effective business model of SideTour.Weaknesses and ThreatsLiquidity And Cash PositionThe company has a cash balance of around $1.1 billion. Even if we consider the cash payment of $100 million for Ticket Monster, the company would have around $1 billion in cash. The current ratio of the company is above 1, demonstrating no liquidity problems. Groupon is not paying dividends. Therefore, the cash can be used to capitalize on new opportunities as they arise. Groupon also has zero gearing in its capital structure making it a company with minimal financial risk and increased debt capacity. The positive outlook of the balance sheet means that the company has some space for experimentation.Valuation:The above mentioned table shows the future growth and current operating margins of the company as compared to the industry average. The table indicates Groupon growth is slightly below the industry average but its operating margin is very low as compared to other companies. So, for valuation purposes the industry P/E cannot be used until a suitable discount is applied. The table below tells the forward PE story of the industry along with Groupon.A multiplier of 30 is selected because of below average growth in revenues and operating margins. A discount of 30% is applied to the average PE in order to reflect the below average performance of Groupon.The mean price target shows that Groupon is overvalued. Despite its future growth prospects, with these earnings going forward, the valuation is set to depreciate. Earnings situation of the company needs to improve if it is to stabilize its market performance.ConclusionGroupon is shifting towards the booming mobile e-commerce by acquiring and developing its own apps. The company is also diversifying into different e-commerce segments to capitalize on this growth. The ""pull strategy"" is helping Groupon to reduce costs and secure deals more efficiently. All these facts point towards future growth of the company and it is expected to grow; if the economic conditions remain unchanged. However, the intensified competition, saturation in the market and the recent Fed Taper, i.e. reduction in stimulus, could hit the company because of its asset structure. With people investing in bonds and limited supply of money in the economy, the purchases of deals and coupons will surely suffer. This will drive down the revenues of Groupon. Moreover, the company is already overvalued as the price target indicates. The investor is paying disproportionately as compared to the growth of the industry. The combination of these factors make Groupon a very good Short Sell target. In case of a broader market sell-off companies like Groupon will be the worst affected which further strengthens the short sell thesis.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1894071,24971,2013-12-12T05:03:58-05:00,,"Over the last few weeks I have been digging into the fundamentals of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and I have to say they are not very exciting. That being said I decided to look at this stock in a Peter Lynch sort of way; from a consumers standpoint. In that regard, the stock seems to have some ""legs"".From the eyes of a consumer here is what we have: Groupon offers discounts via alerts to consumers. The discounts can vary based on the item, the demand, and the manufacturers or retailers desire to move the product.. The consumer buys ""coupons"" to present to the establishment, or buys the product through Groupon to receive the discount.Where Do Revenues Come From Now?Groupon creates revenue primarily by keeping roughly half of the amount paid for its savings coupons.Since GRPN receives revenue from the coupons they sell, the revenues come from the consumer. The need to grow revenues is paramount to the success of the future of Groupon overall, as had been noted in this article by Henry Blodgett, back in May of this year.This chart offers a broad overview:For a bit more clarity, Groupon has a global footprint as well, so revenues from consumers around the world should be pointed out.The international issue should be well addressed by the new website which I will get into in a moment.The most recent fundamentals show these key points:While the company has yet to become profitable, and must work on growing revenues, I believe they are better focused now than previously.The issue that I have with the business model as well as the stock is that this company does not have a very wide moat. Basically, any company who wants to go after this sort of business can get into it with out too many major hurdles. To me, this translates into a business that might not have a long term appeal unless another company wants to get a jump on this business by buying the Groupon brand as well as established customer base by simply forking over a bunch of money to buy the company out. If I recall correctly, Peter Lynch would look at the popularity of what the company offers and what the ""buzz"" is telling us.So What Is Going On Now?Once again, from a consumers perspective, how is the company doing right now? On December 3, 2013, Groupon recorded its biggest four-day weekend of sales since the website was founded in 2008, with billings reportedly up 30 percent year over year.What this tells me is that some of the strategic moves that the company has taken seems to be working. Of course we wont really know until the next earnings report, but if they do well during this time of year, perhaps the company and the stock can gain traction for potential investors and current shareholders.In mid-November, the company embarked on a ""big brand"" coupon program as it took a page from RetailMeNot's playbook of offering ""freebie"" coupons.As noted in this article:These coupons are free. Consumers do not have to pay for them, and the program was marketed by Groupon as a way to give ""back"" to consumers who have purchased coupons from them before. A clever idea, with limited risk if any at all.The idea seemingly has worked, since as reported, those holiday weekend sales by Groupon was up 30%. Of course not just this strategy can be the only catalyst. Groupon has completely redesigned its website to also include these ""Freebie's"" section, to become much more user friendly, and will draw its own following aside from the folks who join or sign up to receive direct emails.Groupon will make money directly from the retailers, not the consumers with this strategy. This will give GRPN another way to increase earnings, which to date have been non existent. Revenues are also beginning to increase based on the dual approach of direct emails as well as the new website. Here is a snapshot of the home page after a visitor gives some very basic information (zip code, location, and some interests):As reported here:The company also launched its holiday store, ""Grouponicus"" for those hard to please folks on your shopping list. You know the ones. They repackage everything like the 50 year old ""Fruitcake"" gift that gets passed around from one hard to please person to another.As noted in this article:The ""Buzz"" Looks Positive To MeWith many changes beginning to work, it seems like now would be the right time to invest in shares of Groupon, I have added a $10k purchase to our Young And Restless Retirement Portfolio for hopefully rapid growth in 2014.The share price was $9.98 when purchased.Keeping in mind that the company does NOT have a wide moat, I will be watching it closely.If the changes made stop working, or shows signs of weakness, I will not stick around for the stock price to drop for Google to buy them out (Just my guess folks, not an arbitrage opinion).Disclosure: I am long GRPN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1912161,38201,2013-12-23T04:54:19-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is expanding its scope in the online deal market with entry into the online coupon. It launched the Freebies category, which includes digital coupons, promotion codes, sales, and samples, all valid for a fixed period of time. Groupon Freebies has more than 25,000 coupons from 5,500 different brands and retailers, including famous brands Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), and Macy's (NYSE:M) across North America.Online coupons typically differ from daily deals where Groupon earns revenue only when the user redeems the coupon. It earns revenue in the form of commission it gets from the retailers. However, in the case of deals, Groupon earns revenue as soon as the user buys the deal.(Source: Grouponworks)Groupon is still in its early phase and can expand its presence in this growing market. The online coupon market is valued at $4 billion in North America, and when combined with in store coupons, the addressable market is worth $28 billion this year. RetailMeNot (SALE) is the world's largest company to operate in the digital coupon marketplace. The company went public in July this year. It has 60,000 retailers and brands offering digital coupons and has contracts with more than 10,000 retailers. RetailMeNot has witnessed 132 million visits on its websites in the third quarter, an increase of around 19% year over year. In the U.S., customers commonly print coupons to receive discounts. However, digital coupons are catching up fast, and around 48% of U.S. adult Internet users redeemed digital coupons last year. As more and more people use the web as a medium to make purchases, the digital coupon user growth forecast has increased from 4.6% to 11% this year, and the digital coupon users total is expected to grow to 110.8 million in 2014 from 102.5 million this year.To continue strengthening its position, Groupon acquired Boomerang, a social gifting service, and it plans to integrate this acquisition with its Freebies coupon services. The Boomerang platform will shut down by the end of this year. People can share gift cards and other deals with their friends through Boomerang, which will be complementary to Groupon Freebies' coupon offering.Groupon's entry into the online coupon market is a positive signal for the company in the long term. This new offering is an extension of its existing product line and targets a similar consumer base. Groupon has many advantages in capturing this market because of its large user base of 43.5 million active customers and its strong position in mobile, as 28% of the people with mobile devices are likely to redeem coupons in the U.S. In addition, online coupons will help improve Groupon's margin since online coupons have higher margins. In comparison to Groupon's margin of 10.5%, RetailMeNot has a margin of 35% based on adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA.More acquisitions on the wayGroupon will acquire Ticket Monster for $260 million in cash and stock, which is expected to close in the first half of 2014. Ticket Monster is a leading Korean e-commerce company that is owned by Groupon's competitor, LivingSocial. The company offers travel-based deals, as well as goods, and has about $800 million in annualized billings with a growth of more than 50% year over year this year.This acquisition may have some headwinds, as Groupon earns 30% commission on its deals, but it may only earn commissions in the low teen percent from Ticket Monster. It is expected that Groupon will earn around $100 million in incremental revenue from this acquisition. However, this may not be great cause of concern since the company's prime focus was to understand the Asian market and have sustainable growth. Ticket Monster will help build Groupon's mobile commerce business as around half of Ticket Monster's sales happen through mobile devices.LivingSocial, in which Amazon (AMZN) has around a 31% stake, had acquired Ticket Monster in 2011 and identified it as a 'non-core asset'. Living Social wanted to sell Ticket Monster to focus on its core business of localized deals, events, and experiences. Living Social will invest the capital from the sale towards product development and marketing in the U.S. So far, Amazon's venture into the daily deal business hasn't been profitable; LivingSocial has incurred a loss of $107 million in the first nine months of this year. Due to this, Amazon had to incur an equity earnings loss of $38 million in the first nine months of 2013. In addition, Amazon competes with Groupon through Amazon Local, a local deal website that offers services, products, and experiences. Quick delivery and access to local deals is what differentiates Amazon from its competitors. Amazon has been trying to expand its product offering with the launch of Kindle and entry into cloud services. Although Amazon did manage to achieve revenue growth of 24% year over year to $17.1 billion in its third quarter due to diversification of its business, it posted a loss for the consecutive second quarter. This is because Amazon is spending heavily on R&D and has focused on long-term growth rather than short-term profits.Bottom-lineThe last quarter wasn't particularly cheery for Groupon investors. The company posted below expected results, and its share price tanked by 5.05% on Nov 7, after the announcement of its third quarter results. In response, Groupon has pursued strategic moves and taken critical steps to expand its scope of operations. This will reduce its reliance on the email channel and improve its financial performance in the coming years. I believe Groupon is poised to re-accelerate its growth and profitability with its ongoing initiatives. Groupon has forecasted its fourth quarter revenue to be between $690 million to $740 million and operating income of $40 million to $60 million, much higher than its last quarter performance. I am optimistic about the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Fusion Research is a team of equity analysts.

1886941,54932,2013-12-09T18:05:58-05:00,,"Groupon, Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN), contrary to the short-sellers' statements, is actually a good long-term bet when it is below $10. As of December 5, GRPN is at $9.09 and, in my opinion, is a perfect bargain buy. This stock has a good potential to make another rally before December is over. The current price is below the 52-week high of $ 12.76 which it posted last September. Once the holiday sales figures are announced by the end of December, GRPN may again creep up toward $11 or $12.Groupon's realigned business model has been amply rewarded by investors. The share has increased a healthy 87.04% since January 2. This positive market movement is a gold seal of approval of Groupon's strategic moves to diversify. The new management is making all the right steps toward a major turnaround for Groupon.Once vilified for its failed business model, Groupon is crawling back to its former heights. Yes, GRPN is still a long way from reaching its IPO offer price of $20 and it may never reach $26 again soon. However, at the current price level it is trading now makes it a good bet for a long-term play. If industry observers are to be believed, Groupon has a good chance of turning in a profit next year. GRPN has a projected positive Forward P/E of 36.36 by December 2014. It may even beat this expectation if Groupon's new business ventures start generating more revenues too.Why the Rally Got DerailedGroupon was strongly on its way to $13 last September but short-sellers and nervous stockholders got cold feet. GRPN went on a downward spiral - it sank as low as $8.54 last December 2. This derailment is most likely due to the semi-lackluster third quarter 2013 results. Semi-successful numbers are often viewed with great suspicion and short-sellers had a sweet time pulling down GRPN since November.Like many others, this article pointed out that Groupon is overpriced based on the 3rd Quarter financial performance. I beg to disagree. The report actually indicates significant improvements in several vital metrics. I say these numbers are realistic signs that the market is undervaluing GRPN.Great Things from 3rd Quarter ReportAll these things point out that Groupon is steadily improving its chances against the hundreds of copycat daily-deals sites. The company's early shift toward mobile e-commerce also gives it a certain edge against behemoths like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Zero Debt and Lots of MoneyHarsh critics of Groupon keep on maligning the company for its failure to produce a profit despite its impressive five-year growth. Things will change around soon. The daily deals business model of Groupon was easily copied. It had to contend with thousands of copycat sites so the losses were justified. However, the rapid implementation of Groupon's mobile e-commerce platform may help it produce a tidy profit in 2014.Not many copycat daily deals sites have the financial muscle to spend lots of cash to build a mobile e-commerce platform. Groupon has a zero debt handicap. It is well capitalized with $1.1 billion cash and cash equivalent reserves. This fact is often not taken into account when calculating the fair value of GRPN.Debt-free momentum growth companies like Groupon make it very attractive because it is not burdened with regular debt payments. The large cash reserve it has allows it to take risks that debt-laden companies cannot afford.More Diversity, Buy More CompaniesGroupon's purchase of Ticket Monster last month shows it is willing to spend some of its cash hoard for worthwhile investments. The ironic thing about that purchase is that Ticket Monster was bought from Groupon's rival Living Social. The deal gives Living Social $160 million worth of Groupon stock.Nevertheless, Ticket Monster has a strong chance to increase the profitability of Groupon. That particular outfit has a solid presence in Korea, earning $800 million of annual revenue from millions of customers.The daily deals business is ultra competitive with too many players already on it. Groupon is shrewdly making the right moves to lessen its reliance from its original cash flow business. The new management team is willing to risk some of the company's fat cash reserves to acquire new units of business. I like what they are doing. Buying a well establish company is much cheaper to do than putting up a new subsidiary.ConclusionGroupings sub-$10 valuation of the stock market may be justified by its negative EPS. However, bargain hunters willing to hold GRPN for long-term gains should consider buying this stock now at the $9 to $9.99 price range. The holiday season is upon us, the company's unique Grouponicus holiday promo of bundled Christmas deals will most likely help it achieve record breaking sales this December.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1929761,58981,2014-01-06T09:26:02-05:00,,"After its meteoric rise in early December that prompted me to comment that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) may be a bit ahead of itself, the stock has been trading in a fairly narrow band since December 18th. After going up over $2 in two weeks, it has now traded in a much more narrow band for just over another two weeks. It has broken above $12 and closed slightly above this nice round number to close last week, but hasn't moved outside this range after setting new highs almost daily earlier in December. Yes volume has been light due to two mid-week trading holidays, but for a momentum stock with a large amount of both long and short interest, this consolidation requires watching for a spike in volume and the next direction of movement.There are some key drivers mentioned in Groupon's 3Q13 report, slides and analysis that bear close watching and interest when their next reports are filed. My personal opinion is this trading range is likely to continue until this quarter's earnings report in February. Let's look at some key areas Groupon is working on that could justify current valuations and even drive the stock higher:PULL AdvertisingHistorically, Groupon has been a ""push marketing"" company, sending e-mails and alerts with their offers, deals and coupons. However, ""pull"", where the consumer seeks out information has both a higher conversion rate and margin. While also competitive and highly dependent on placement, ""pull"" is a good move while continuing to offer the push e-mail offers. It's pretty much a no-lose strategy, and if Groupon can continue to expand its share, this would be a positive sign.Ongoing deployment of cashGroupon closed the Ticket Monster purchase in the first week of January, utilizing $100M in cash as well as Class A shares for the purchase. This allowed Groupon to purchase a leading eCommerce company in a strong market without overly diluting the common stock with an all-stock purchase. This is an expansion into the Korean marketplace with a market leader done with both business and investor concerns in mind. While cash flow turned negative in 3Q13, a large part of this was investing activity like the Ticket Monster purchase from Living Social, which can drive long-term profitability and growth. Groupon must diversify and this is a good use of the large, $1.14B cash position it has been able to accumulate despite negative earnings. If other deals and development are coming, this could justify an increased valuation. This report mentions six businesses acquired in the nine months ending September 30th, 2013, including Ticket Monster. As Groupon deploys its large cash balance, future acquisitions are likely.Rest of World (ROW)As mentioned above, the Ticket Monster acquisition alongside other purchases continue Groupon's expansion worldwide. While the U.S. market has grown and was where Groupon ""cut their teeth"" so to say, this is a highly competitive and fickle market, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others also competing in this space. While Amazon and others won't let Groupon expand internationally unopposed, the company has bought or partnered with leaders in its target global markets. Year over year unit sales in ROW were flat in the 3Q13 analysis (from the 3Q13 Investor Presentation) and as this picks up with the purchase of Ticket Monster and other acquisitions this could be a large revenue driver.Ticket Monster looks to be an acquisition that not only adds value to Groupon, it may actually influence and change Groupon going forward. While calling it a ""reverse hostile takeover"" would be overstating the realities, Ticket Monster shows the product diversity and mobile focus Groupon is striving to implement across the board.Rest of World margin and revenue figures have trended in a positive direction over the past two quarters, and if Groupon turns the corner and ROW becomes a profitable segment this could definitely drive the valuations we are seeing in the stock and at least the average to above average stock price estimates for 2014. Of course, this is not without risk, as all multi-national corporations face challenges as they expand into different regulatory and custom/culture situations, but Groupon appears to be buying talent and leadership as it expands.SummaryWhile I stand by my earlier analysis that Groupon's quick appreciation in December was likely too far, too fast, the analysis that it is an investment trap needs to be hedged, and I am moving to a more nuanced view of the company. 4Q13 and 1Q14 results likely will be quite telling in light of Rest of World (ROW) growth and Groupon's ability to deploy its large cash holdings to diversify its offerings and implement new apps, ""pull"" deals and other drivers that warrant an even higher valuation. The prudent investor should consider the likelihood of revenue and profit growth and the already lofty valuation as well as Groupon's strategic moves made over the past few quarters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Groupon's highly anticipated Q3 financial report revealed its EPS beat expectations by $0.02 as Groupon saw continued growth and announced a deal to acquire ""Ticket Monster.""Financial HighlightsHealthy revenue growth and a bright future in mobile e-commerce is driving Groupon's performance.The chart below indicates strong expectations for Groupon's shares to increase from their present closing value of $9.50 per share. If Groupon continues to execute and reports better than expected results in Q4 2013, shares could reach the $16 target in Q1 2014. Conservatively, I expect to see between $14 to $15 before Christmas.(Click to enlarge)Acquisition Of Ticket MonsterDuring the Q3 conference call CFO Jason Child highlighted Groupon's deal to acquire Ticket Monster and the company's performance. Ticket Monster's year-over-year growth rate and annual billings are highly impressive. The purchase price of $100 million cash and $160 million in stock makes this acquisition the ""deal of the day."" Child comments:There exist a threefold benefit for Groupon in acquiring Ticket Monster:Stock RepurchaseGroupon is continuing their repurchase program and thus far repurchased 770,900 shares at an average price of $11.67. Going forward, the company plans to repurchase an additional $291 million in stock. Logic dictates that when a company is willing to pay $11.67 per share, it can only mean they see the stock trading much higher. Shareholders have a strong investment partner with deep pockets in Groupon's repurchase program. You could not ask for better sponsorship at $11.67. I will not be surprised to learn at the end of Q4 that Groupon was repurchasing shares this past month in anticipation of the run up. Here's what CFO Child said during the conference call:When a company announces it will repurchase its own shares, many investors take a wait and see attitude. But when you see the company buying at $11.67, there is a strong probability they see something on the horizon that management determined will drive the price higher. I believe it was Investor's Business Daily's founder, William O'Neil, that first said:Navigating The ChartsThe chart below forecast important technical indicators. Keep a close watch on the $12.65 breakout. The $15 price target is where I believe we are headed near term. The $16 price target called by Deutsche Bank could be reached as early as Q1 2014, provided Groupon executes better than expected on their conservative Q4 2013 forecast.(Click to enlarge)With the holiday season here and the economy starting to recover, Groupon is well positioned to exploit the increased consumer shopping and dining out that is so prevalent during Q4.ConclusionGroupon's rapid transition into mobile e-commerce is changing the way consumers ""do Groupon."" Instead of going to your laptop and searching your email for a Groupon coupon for lunch or dinner, that unfortunately has expired, tap your phone's G-app and discover a valid coupon waiting for you to purchase in seconds. Within minutes you are tweeting ""just scored a 1/2 price steak dinner on my G-app!"" Online based companies could see their coupons go viral in hours.It has been said:Groupon's CEO knows exactly where he's taking Groupon and shared that vision:Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

1859541,23479,2013-11-24T04:26:28-05:00,,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock has recovered significantly in the last few months, thanks to the change in leadership and the company's investment in key growth areas of mobile, 'local' and 'pull'. While these efforts are focused on reviving its bread and butter 'daily deals' business, the company has been making some more strategic investments to diversify into other areas. These include physical goods, travel, and now discount coupons. Groupon recently launched a digital coupon business with 25,000 coupons from 5,500 different brands and retailers in North America. These discount coupons differ from the company's daily deals in the sense that Groupon will earn revenue only when users redeem these coupons and make purchases. In case of daily deals, the company collects the money upfront regardless of whether a customer actually makes use of the deals or not. This suggests that the incremental revenue opportunities may be relatively low. However, given the market opportunity, Groupon can add meaningful value to its stock if it can take even 10% share of the U.S. online discount coupons market.The Market Opportunity For GrouponGroupon will get a commission fee from merchants based on the sales made through the discount coupons. The company's advantage lies in its wide reach, which makes it easy and quick to market new products and services. At the end of 2012, Groupon had close to 80 million subscribers in North America which suggests that the discount coupon business can be an instant hit as it gets promoted across this vast subscriber base. The online coupon market in North America stands at $4 billion annually, and the total coupon market is somewhere around $28 billion indicating that in-store coupons still account for the majority of the industry's revenues. Nevertheless, we expect the sales of online coupons to increase at a much faster rate as the overall e-commerce market continues to grow. The increased usage of Internet-enabled mobile devices has facilitated the customer shift to online shopping. Groupon, along with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), is going to benefit from this trend.The company's net revenues stood at less than $2.5 billion in 2012, and will show only mild growth in 2013 (source: SEC filings). Keeping that in perspective, $28 billion discount coupons market seems like an attractive investment. In fact, Groupon can add almost 15% to its value if it is able to grab even 10% share of the online coupons market. This will imply incremental revenues of close to $400-$500 million over the next few years. The long term opportunity can be much bigger, especially as the share of online coupons in the overall discount coupon sales increases.Disclosure: No positions"
1858821,40781,2013-11-22T18:04:21-05:00,,"If you're anything like me then you tend to look for stocks that are currently underpriced and have significant room to run. I mean why else would you invest in something that has limited value or upside?Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), a global leader in local commerce, has had a remarkable turnaround this year and investors have been rewarded. Looking back over the last year, shares of Groupon have more than tripled.However, looking at Groupon's recent earnings report, I was disappointed with the results and believe that Groupon has very limited upside at this point. After earnings were announced, shares quickly tumbled before eventually recovering. Lets take a look at some of the positives as well as some of the negatives from the report.Groupon's EarningsTwo weeks ago, Groupon reported sales of $595M vs $616M, far lower than what analyst's were expecting. Groupon did beat on the bottom line thanks to its share repurchase program. The Company earned two cents per share vs. estimates of a penny per share. So what were some of the highlights from the report?Earnings DisappointmentWhile Groupon did have some nice quarterly highlights, not everything was fine and dandy for the company.While Groupon likes to point out the huge mobile growth the company is experiencing right now, it seems to have no influence on the spending habits of its customers. As we can in the table below, the average continues to go down every quarter. It's no secret that in order to make money, consumers first have to spend money. Groupon is going to have to find a better way if it wants to reverse this downtrend.Groupon OverpricedGroupon has had an amazing run this year as shares have more than tripled this year. One of the questions to ask yourself now is, how much upside is left in the stock and is Groupon really worth it at these levels?One of the things that I look at when comparing companies are the P/E ratios of both forward and trailing. This helps show how expensive one company can be to the other.Because of the losses Groupon has had in the past, it has no trailing P/E. However, now that it has crossed into the black, Groupon does sport a forward P/E of 38. So how does this compare to its peers?As we can see, Groupon is pretty expensive when compared to its peers. If we give Groupon the market average (a forward P/E of 25), which is higher than its peers, shares would be worth $6.25. (0.25 [2014 EPS] X 25 [Forward P/E] = $6.25. Considering this, I believe Groupon is a stock that should be actively looked at by investors to short.Right now shares are trading just under $10 a share. I don't know about you, but I know a fair amount of companies that are growing revenues by more than 8% year-over-year that sport a forward P/E of less than 38. Because of this, I believe that Groupon is overpriced and in the short term upside is very limited.As revenue growth continues to slide year-over-year, the share price continues to go up. It makes perfect sense right (sarcasm)? One of the reasons why shares have gone up is because of the company's share repurchase program. In the latest earnings report, the company bought back over 770K shares at an average price of $11.67 per share.That leaves the company with up to $291M that it can use to buy back shares. The program is intended to offset dilution from employee stock grants that terminates in August 2015. With shares currently trading two dollars less than what the Company originally bought back shares for, investors better hope the Company manages its funds better. It's not the best sign if the Company continues to overpay for shares. There are plenty of things you can do with cash. Remember, cash is king and shouldn't be wasted.Don't get me wrong, Groupon is a nice company and all, but there are many plays out there in the market that you could do more with. Let's not forget either that insiders continue to sell shares at a high rate.Over the last six months, insiders have sold more than 40 million worth of stock. So where are all of the insiders buys? If management believed in the company you would think they would be purchasing shares at these levels. Instead they are using the company's own cash to buy back shares. While you shouldn't base your entire investment strategy on what insiders are doing, it's certainly something that should be taken greatly into consideration.Knowing who you can trust in the market is very important. That's why I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I like.

The company tried to turn its luck by firing the Founder and CEO, but that hasn't seemed to help much. Recent inbox changes by Gmail and growing lack of interest among users to buy into daily deals are also not welcome news.Groupon's FinancialsGroupon's Q3 revenues grew 5% over the year to $595.1 million, driven by 24% growth in revenues from North America. Increased investments in EMEA have yet to deliver results. Revenues from EMEA fell 21% over the year and those from the rest of the world fell 4%. Groupon ended the quarter with EPS of $0.02. Analysts were looking for revenues of $613.0 million with a loss of $0.02 per share for the quarter.Groupon's mobile push has seen strong traction. Within North America, more than 50% of their transactions were from mobile devices. Globally, more than 40% of their transactions were initiated from mobile devices. At the end of the quarter, Groupon's mobile app had been installed by more than 60 million people, with 9 million downloads being recorded in the previous quarter.Among other metrics, the number of active deals at the end of the quarter grew to more than 65,000 compared with 54,000 a quarter ago. Subscribers who have purchased a Groupon deal within the past year grew 10% to 43.5 million with 19.9 million of them in North America, 14 million in EMEA, and 9.6 million in the rest of the world. The average revenue per customer per year dropped from $138 a quarter ago to $137 during the previous quarter. During the quarter, Groupon spent $9 million to repurchase 770,900 shares at an average price of $11.67 per share.For the current quarter, Groupon projects revenues of $690 million-$740 million, compared with the market's projections of $723.7 million. Groupon expects to end the quarter with earnings of $0.00-$0.02 per share, falling significantly short of the Street's projections of earnings of $0.06 per share.Google Adds to Groupon's WoesThe daily deals market has been plagued by lack of interest among subscribers, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has made life more difficult for these vendors. In a recent move, Google organized Gmail subscriber mail accounts to sort emails into Primary, Social, and Promotion categories. With online marketing mails spamming mailboxes, this automatic filtering has helped Gmail subscribers. But it has hurt several retailers as online shopping-related mails are pushed to the Promotions folder and are not viewed as frequently by subscribers. Like other retailers, Groupon has been upset, as Google's move has led to consumers missing out on time-sensitive deals.Groupon has taken several steps to ensure that it lessens the impact of such changes in the future, considering that emails sent out account for 40% of its deals transactions. The company is limiting the number of mails that are sent out to consumers and is also evaluating the option of operating a website that will not require users to log in using an email account. In addition, it is building a marketplace for online deals called Pull that will let consumers search for deals online instead of sending them deals in their area.Groupon's International ExpansionGroupon continues to invest big in international operations. Earlier this month, it announced the acquisition of Ticket Monster, a South Korea-based e-commerce player. Ticket Monster is a subsidiary of Groupon's rival, LivingSocial.com. It was founded in 2010 to cater to the South Korean market by providing online access to consumers looking to purchase goods and local and travel offers. Ticket Monster's annual billing is expected to be more than $800 million. Groupon acquired Ticket Monster for $260 million.Groupon's stock is trading at $9.99 with a market capitalization of $6.65 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $12.76 in September 2013."
1865811,20411,2013-11-27T09:07:13-05:00,,"By Neal RauGroupon Inc. (GRPN) has been struggling to find ways to offset it diminishing email to consumer business, as companies like Google Inc. (GOOG) have added filters to organize Gmail subscriber mail accounts to sort emails into Primary, Social, and Promotion categories. Google's move has led to fewer consumers reading time-sensitive deals. Shares of GRPN have fallen 27% from the 52-week highs made in September. Is this a buying opportunity in shares of GRPN?Groupon's business model has been very easy to copy, as hundreds of daily deal offers have sprung up over the past few years. Merchants also have to evaluate how much half off coupons can drive future business, and which daily deals might offer the most customers who are likely to return and pay the normal prices.Groupon sends out emails for about 40% of its deal transactions, which it will be limiting in the future and considering removing the requirement to log in with an email address. The company plans to offer an online marketplace where consumers can search for local deals in their area, instead of the traditional email deal notifications. As the company is working on that transition, the stock has been moving lower. Based on the real-time GRPN trading report published by Stock Traders Daily, the stock has recently broken below long-term support, which is now converted resistance.The company's business model has yet to gain traction, as Groupon's IPO price was $20 two years ago, and now the stock is trading less than half its IPO price, in very strong bull market. Facebook Inc. (FB) suffered a similar setback after its IPO, but with the help of mobile monetization, the stock has recovered and made its IPO shareholders profits. Groupon shares have rallied strongly since Andrew Mason was fired as CEO back in February, but new management still has not presented a business model that has convinced investors that the daily deal business is not just a fad.The most recent quarter report revealed that the number of active deals at the end of the quarter increased to more than 65,000 compared with 54,000 a quarter ago. Subscribers who purchased a Groupon deal within the past year grew 10% to 43.5 million. The average revenue per customer per year dropped from $138 a quarter ago to $137 during the previous quarter.The company's international expansion has not gone smoothly, as it entered too many markets, too soon. International business decreased 17% YOY and worse was Europe, Middle East and Africa, which declined 24% YOY. The latest expansion effort involved the purchase of competitor LivingSocial's profitable South Korean daily deals business, Ticket Monster, which Groupon purchased for $260 million in cash and stock. Ticket Monster has been one of the few strong segments of the international markets, and it makes a sizeable portion of its revenue from selling consumer goods, a line of business where Groupon has also found some success in the last year.Groupon has many challenges and probably the most notable is whether the company can succeed in the Goods segment competing against Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). The traditional model still after two years has not convinced merchants if the model is nothing more than push drive-by sales with low margins, harming merchants as much as helping them.Earlier this month, USA Today reported that during the three months ended in late October, the ratio of insider sales to purchases of Groupon shares had skyrocketed to 100-to-1. Insiders, including executives, board members and early investors - sold a whopping 301.7 million Groupon shares during that time while buying just 3.2 million. Among those selling shares in recent months is Groupon co-founder Bradley A. Keywell who sold 500,000 shares of Groupon stock in a transaction dated October 29, yielding nearly $4.7 million for Keywell, who is a board director. Shares were trading around $9.14 on October 29.Smart money will be watching price going forward. Shares of Groupon were up 160% YTD in September, but the stock is now down over 27% from that 52-week high. The stock has broken below long-term support, which means long-term support is now converted resistance, and as long as the stock remains below converted resistance, as defined in our GRPN real time trading report, Stock Traders Daily expects lower levels. That would make GRPN a sell/short at resistance, with risk controls in place if resistance breaks higher.Stock Traders Daily has been providing comprehensive market analysis, and correlated trading strategies since January 2000, which was the virtual peak of the Internet Bubble.

Groupon customers find incredible deals at up to 50% savings. What began as a daily deal coupon sent to your email has evolved into a powerful marketing behemoth. Praised for cutting edge innovations, the company continues to grow with the goal of world e-commerce dominance. Groupon's CEO Eric Lefkofsky had this to say:Most investors know that Jim Cramer has been one of Groupon's harshest critics, calling Groupon a ""broken company"" back in 2011. But more recently, Cramer has seen the light and joined the choir of analysts singing Groupon's praises. Cramer reversed his position and started recommending Groupon to his Mad Money audience. In November 2013 Cramer blogged:Not everyone shares Cramer's optimism. Naysayers scoff at Groupon's success. They insist investors pay no attention to Groupon's forecasted 2013 record breaking annual revenues, estimated at $2.5 billion, and totally ignore Groupon's $0.02 EPS non-GAAP that beat analyst estimates in Q3 2013 and are expected to blow out Q4. They hope investors will not realize Groupon's North American revenues jumped 24% YOY in Q3 and combined global revenues jumped 4.7%. They think investors will overlook the fact that management developed the world's largest mobile e-commerce platform, allowing Groupon to transact 40% of its Q3 deals on mobile devices.Naysayers see Groupon as nothing more than a digital spam company and suggested Groupon would be bankrupt by now. However, and much to their chagrin, the exact opposite happened. Groupon is growing revenues, creating the first global discount world marketplace, and has become the dominant mobile e-commerce player on a global scale.Groupon is changing, adapting, growing and morphing into a mammoth e-commerce business with the largest discount mobile sales transactions. With more than 60 million apps downloaded and growing, it has become impossible to deny or ignore Groupon is headed higher.Here Are The 7 Reasons Why Groupon Is A BuyBefore concluding I want to address the insider selling that took place earlier this month. It was not wholesale dumping as some suppose. I commented and explained the profit taking in a recent blog. You should note that about 64% of Groupon's shares are owned by institutional investors and over 30% held by insiders. The CEO sold about half of 1% and still holds 99.5% or 108.9 million shares. So before you buy into the lie of ""insider dumping,"" do yourself a favor and check out the facts. All insiders sell a few shares at some point. There is no reason to construe this as anything other than a little well deserved profit taking.ConclusionWhen you consider Groupon is trading around $9 per share, the strong institutional ownership, analysts' upgrades, back-to-back YOY revenue growth, no debt, $1.1 billion cash, mobile growth and entering Q4 with record breaking annual revenues ($2.5 billion), it becomes easy to see shares rising to $13 as the first leg up and then $15.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

While they certainly could, there is never a guarantee in the markets.While we can see that Groupon has posted both positive and negative surprises on the day of earnings, the real question for investors is how has the stock price reacted to the news? In one word. Crazy! The table below tells the story.The reaction to Groupon's earnings have been wild, crazy and volatile as you can see. This can be an investor or traders dream, or it can turn into a nightmare.So if Groupon has beaten expectations for the last three quarters, why has the share price popped and dropped? There are a couple of reasons why. Let's take a look at them.* Image taken from the Washington PostConclusionI like Groupon from a consumer standpoint; however, from an investment standpoint, I'm very cautious at this point in time. Investors should remember that just because you like a company doesn't always translate to be the greatest investment. Don't let emotion get in the way of doing your due diligence.Looking at Groupon's recent earnings history we can see that shares have popped and dropped substantially on earnings day. Groupon has had a remarkable turnaround no doubt about it. So the question remains, should investors sell or hold their shares through earnings?That is a very tough question. However, given the recent run that Groupon has been on this year, I would be somewhat hesitant going into earnings. While seeing stocks in your portfolio rise is a great feeling, seeing them fall hurts even more. That's why I would take a more cautious approach with Groupon.Of Wall Street recommendations, the average opinion on Groupon is a hold, with a price target average of $11.88. Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper diligence on any stock mentioned in this article. Have a great day and as always, I look forward to hearing your thoughts or questions that you might have.Disclaimer: Images were from Groupon's earning slides.

However, it has moved beyond just another daily deal business with its strategic change from a push model to pull model. This company has found a new path for dealing with discounts and coupons, i.e. mobile, which we covered in our last report. Now the company is diversifying itself and aims to become the go-to place for consumers to find just about anything, anywhere, anytime. Just how does Groupon plan to transform itself into a one stop destination amid rising competition in this market?Thinking beyond daily dealsIn order to diversify its business beyond daily deals, Groupon is on an acquisition spree. It acquired Blink, a hotel booking app, this month. Blink has partnership with more than 2,000 hotels in eight European countries. It offers last-minute hotel deals to consumers and helps to fill up hotel's inventory. Groupon will brand Blink as ""Blink by Groupon,"" and it will operate as a separate entity. This acquisition will complement its existing Groupon Getaways, which offers travel deals and hotel discounts to consumers, and will expand its travel business in Europe.(Source: eMarketer)European travel bookings represented 37.7% of the total global online sales in 2012 and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.70% from 2012-2016. The European online travel sales are expected to be $150 billion in 2013, and contribute around 47% of European travel sales. Expedia (EXPE) has reported 70% of its room bookings through its mobile app, or mobile site, were done by users traveling within the next day. This indicates the rising demand for last-minute bookings through mobile devices. Although Blink is just few years old and very small compared to heavy-weights, Expedia and Priceline (PCLN), the potential for Blink to grow in the European travel market is tremendous.(Please read our past coverage on Expedia and Priceline)Just over a week later, after the acquisition of Blink on Sep 9, 2013, Groupon acquired SideTour, a market place where people could discover, book, and host local events. SideTour suggest events and activities to other users with the help of qualified experts. Users who want to discover more about their city and find unique things are willing to pay for this service. The main idea is to attract consumers who are willing to pay a premium for local events and activities in their cities. Inclusion of SideTour in Groupon's business model will broaden Groupon's user base.With the acquisition of Blink and SideTour, Groupon is taking steps to differentiate itself from its competitors and build a diverse user base for long-term sustainability of its business.There's more to captureGroupon has been able to launch new product categories more successfully than most of its competitors in different geographies. Groupon's total addressable market encompasses both sides of the marketplace, i.e. customers and merchants. It has over 200 million subscribers and 43 million active customers since its inception five years back. This was achieved despite some challenges faced in acquisitions to combine different systems and technologies. The biggest issue for Groupon is the rising competition in the social buying business. With a low entry barrier, many players have entered the market offering similar kinds of deals. Groupon has successfully maintained its position in this business by leveraging on its brand and through offering specialized food, travel, and event deals. Online shopping is on the rise globally, and presents a good opportunity for Groupon to add new users.According to emarketer, digital buyers are expected to rise to around 1.02 billion in 2013, which is a 12% year-over-year increase. The Groupon's current subscriber base represents around 20% of the total potential market, with active users representing only 4.2%. As the Groupon brand continues to re-establish itself as the go-to place for deals in any category, across both PC and mobile channels, we believe Groupon's presence can expand further in international markets. The future of Groupon depends on its ability to build a loyal base and drive repeated purchases through it site.Big boys also in the fightAmazon (AMZN) has a 29% stake in Living Social, which is viewed as a significant threat for Groupon in the daily deal business. It has decided to adopt a similar strategy to move beyond daily deals this month. It isn't closing down deals on restaurants, spas, etc.; instead it is expanding the number of deals. The new deals will include travel, event, and entertainment deals. Amazon has pumped regular investments into the company, but thus far hasn't been able to reap any rewards; Living Social has shown continuous losses. It reported net loss of $31 million, a 38% year-over-year decrease, in the second quarter this year. The new strategy will expand its business and acquire new customers over time.(Read in detail about Amazon here and here)If that wasn't enough, Google Offers, a service offering discounts and coupons from Google (GOOG), has decided to refund customers for the deals they never used. Customers who have purchased a deal from Google Offers in the past but failed to redeem it will be given the option of a refund or receiving Google Play credits with additional bonuses. For example, if a customer has a $25 unused offer, then he may have an option of receiving $25 in his account or $30 through Google Play credits. Google Offers has also adopted a different approach, which allows users to add vouchers without paying in advance and simply paying at the store when redeeming the voucher. This is a much different model from Groupon and Living Social, where users have to pay for the deal in advance. This will help Google attract more users and drive up the repeated purchase due to the convenience of purchase and additional bonus offered under the refund.Bottom-lineGroupon has done well to evolve itself as a daily deal business to one stop destination for online discounts. The competition in this business is heating up, and Groupon is expanding its presence in diverse products and different geographies. The entry of Amazon and Google can be a headwind for Groupon, especially as these companies have existing large user bases.(Source: finviz)It would be difficult to compare Groupon on the basis of current P/E, as the company is still reporting losses. However, estimates point to a forward P/E of 39.76 in the year 2014, indicating future profitability for Groupon in the coming years, with EPS expected to witness a 90% rise this year. Groupon's fundamentals and valuation are compelling, and its stock remains attractive investment right now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1733602,40781,2013-10-08T04:34:06-04:00,,"When you look for stocks that have outperformed the market, it does not take long for investors to notice the huge run that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been on. Just this year, Groupon has rewarded investors with gains over 140% and is one of the top performing technology stocks this year. The graph below shows the run that Groupon has been on.Since its Initial Public Offering [IPO] back in 2011, shares of Groupon are still down more than 40%. Last year was a tough time for investors as shares of Groupon fell below three dollars, valuing the company around two billion. This was a far cry from the six billion bid in which Google reportedly offered to buy the company before it went public.Nevertheless, shares of Groupon have recovered nicely over the year and hopefully those investors were patient enough to hold on to this very profitable run. So what should investors do now? I personally feel that it might be a good time to start thinking about selling those shares. Why would I say this? Let us look at some of the reasons below.1) Last Quarter's Earnings Report: The Good And The BadOn August 7, 2013, shares of Groupon soared 27% after its earnings announcement. So what made the stock pop? There were a couple of things that happened.First, Groupon made it official by giving Eric Lefkofsky the job as the new CEO. Second, Groupon announced a share repurchase program of $300 million over the next two years. Lastly, Groupon beat on revenues [$608.7 million vs. $606.2 million] and came in-line with analysts' estimates with earnings per share [EPS] at 2 cents.So did the earnings announcement really warrant the big pop? I don't believe so. In fact, I was a bit disappointed with some of the things in the report. Here are some takeaways from Groupon's latest earning results.As we can see, Groupon's operating income had the biggest decline as income dropped more than 40%. As we know, operating income is a good measure of a company's overall health. A decline in operating income means there is less money for other things. Some of these things might be paying off debt, expanding and anything else the company has planned. With Groupon's rising costs, it will be interesting to see what next month's earnings report looks like.2) Earnings Per Share Keeps Trending DownEarnings per share [EPS], is the amount of income that is allocated to each outstanding share of a company's stock. EPS is considered by many to be one of the most important variable in determining a share's price. It's also a major component used to calculate ratios such as price-to-earnings [P/E] and forward price-to-earnings ratio [Forward P/E].Watching what is taking place can help determine where the company is headed and if the company has a bright outlook or not. So what is taking place with Groupon? The chart below explains it all.* Graph taken from Yahoo!FinanceAs we can see Groupon's EPS is trending down. Analysts had higher expectations for the company a month or two ago, but have since cut back on expectations and estimates. This clearly isn't a great sign for shareholders expecting a large amount of growth from the company.3) Groupon Is OvervaluedOne of the things that I look at when comparing companies are the P/E ratios of both forward and trailing. This helps show how expensive one company can be to the other.Because of the losses Groupon has had in the past, it has no trailing P/E. However, now that it has crossed into the black, Groupon does sport a forward P/E of 40. So how does this compare to its peers?As we can see Groupon is pretty expensive when compared to eBay, Overstock and the entire sector. If we give Groupon the market average of a forward P/E of 25, Groupon would be worth $7.50. Right now shares are trading just over $11 a share. I know a fair amount of companies that grow revenues by more than 7% with a forward P/E of less than 40. As you can see, there are better plays out in the market right now.4) Consumer Spending Is Going DownIt's no secret that in order to make money, consumers first have to spend money. So how have things been going for Groupon over the last couple of quarters? Not as good as they claim.As you can see, total consumer spending has been going down and continues to go down. I find it laughable that Groupon stated its global spending remained flat, meanwhile boasting about a $5 spending increase in North America. The chart clearly shows that not only global spending is on the decline, but the total average is as well.I do have to give credit where credit is due. Groupon, which used to be a one trick pony over the years, has done a remarkable job at getting deals out to consumers. The chart on the right explains it all.Nevertheless, Groupon isn't out of the woods just yet. While they continue to expand and to grow, they will continue to run into competition along the way.Because of the business model that Groupon runs, it does not have many barriers to entry. Groupon faces not only tough competition from the likes of Priceline (PCLN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), but from hundreds of more companies doing the exact same thing.Remember when Amazon took a big stake in LivingSocial? It has yet to recoup on its investment. LivingSocial continues to post losses every quarter and has become a drag on Amazon's earnings. Just in 2012 alone, LivingSocial lost $650 million.While some investors called it a victory, others were not so sure what to make of it when Facebook and Yelp retreated from the market. It comes down to two things. Either the daily deals market was headed nowhere, or Groupon and LivingSocial had the market cornered. You can believe what you want, but the results speak for themselves as the daily deal sites continue to post losses.5) Consumer FatigueIf you are anything like me you get pretty tired of the same emails every day.Over the years, Groupon has put a lot of pressure on sending a vast amount of daily emails to its customers hoping to prey on their impulsive buying habits.While it's nice to get offers and reminders, overdoing it can become a drain on the consumer. This is especially true when the offers are for things that most customers would never want or use.Just look up at the graph of offers that have been sent to me over the last week. Sorry Groupon, but I will pass again on getting my nails done along with my facial and laser treatments. If the offers were for something that I was actually interested in, I might take a look at them. However, seeing as how I come across these offers on a regularly basis, I have no interest in them anymore.ConclusionThe social media space has had a huge increase in share appreciation over the last couple of months with the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD). Some of that is in part to the Twitter hype of the soon to be IPO. Along with that comes a big valuation which investors are counting on to raise all social media stocks.We have all heard the analogy of a rising tide lifts all boats. Investors seem to apply that here. However, don't forget about history. Remember when Facebook was going to lift the tide of social media stocks when it went public back in 2012? Well the exact opposite happened as social media stocks got crushed when Facebook went public.I like Groupon from a consumer standpoint; however, from an investment standpoint, I'm very cautious at this point in time. Investors should remember that just because you like a company doesn't always translate to be the greatest investment. Don't let emotion get in the way of doing your due diligence.Groupon, just like most social media stocks, operates a highly popular business in which it gains millions of new users every quarter. However, no matter how popular these companies become, it all comes down to generating profits. That is the key.So what is the bottom line with Groupon? I personally feel that it might be a good time to get out. Don't get me wrong, Groupon is a nice company and all, but there are many plays out there in the market that you could do more with. For example, my technology portfolio which has gained over 70% since April, still has a lot more room to run. With Groupon's revenues growing at just 7% and a P/E of over 40, I think I will pass on this company for sure. Unless earnings are impressive next quarter, I feel that Groupon could be a great short all the back into the $7-$8 range.It certainly doesn't help either that insiders are relentlessly selling the stock. If you don't believe me then look at the chart below.Since last year, insiders have sold more than 27 million shares. So where are all of the insiders buys? If management believed in the company you would think they would be purchasing shares at these levels.Instead they are using the company's own cash to buy back shares. Is this because they continue to plan on selling more shares in the near future? We shall see. Remember, while you shouldn't base your entire investment strategy on what insiders are doing, it's certainly something that should be taken greatly into consideration.Disclaimer: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper diligence on any stock mentioned in this article and to make sure you are comfortable with your investment strategy.

1786062,38201,2013-10-30T05:43:15-04:00,,"The E-commerce industry is flooded with many players with different service offerings. The preference of the industry has shifted from discounts and offers to daily deals and finally towards the mobile platform. Groupon (GRPN), which is the leader in the U.S. daily deal business, is also shifting to the mobile platform. Although its share price declined in the recent months due to the forecast of low gross billings, the company has been streamlining its operation and coming up with new service offering specifically aimed at the mobile platform. The big question is, can this company offset its decline in gross billing with growth in mobile transactions?Speed up your purchaseAfter building a strong mobile platform and change in strategy from a push to pull model, the company is hoping increased consumer spending through new innovations. In order to ease the purchasing process on mobile, Groupon introduced a feature that will allow users to save their credit card information through a mobile device's built-in camera. Users can now scan their credit cards with Groupon's mobile app, and it will identify and save their credit card information. This app would also save other information, such as billing and shipping address, saving users' time retyping such information. We believe that this new feature will enhance users' comfort and experience, thus making mobile devices more popular among Groupon users. The latest offerings are designed to suit the changing behavior of users towards mobile, and the growth in mobile-related transactions will contribute to company's bottom-line.(Source: mobilecommercial)The growing emphasis on the mobile segment is due to the rise in the number of Groupon mobile transactions and decline in transactions through e-mails. Groupon has more than 50 million downloads of its app worldwide to date, and around half of the deal purchases happen through mobile devices. Groupon deals are updated almost every hour and generally are valid for a limited time, thus mobile plays an essential role in booking last minute deals. Groupon claims that it has the largest percentage of transactions occurring on mobile devices as compared to any other major e-commerce company. We believe the company's focus towards mobile commerce, will help it to tackle the decline in the daily deal business. Mobile users spend on average 50% more than desktop users, and the company has the ability to monetize this and maintain its revenue growth in the coming years.Marketing expense of Groupon(Source: Company data)Where on one hand Groupon is looking to boost its top-line, on the other, it is keeping an eye on its bottom-line through monitoring its expenses. Marketing expense as a percentage of sales has declined from a peak of 93% in 2010 to 9.12% in the second quarter of 2013. This is due to the result of pull based approach adopted by the company. The company has dramatically reduced its marketing expense, due to the transition from push to pull. Instead of focusing on advertising and marketing, Groupon wants users to be attracted towards its website as a result of its lucrative deals. This decline is marketing expenses is a good sign for the company and will help tackle the decline in gross billing in the coming quarter.What are the big boys doing?Recently ITG Investment Research estimated that gross billings will decline in the third quarter and will show 20% year-over-year growth as compared to 30% in the previous quarter. The biggest issue for Groupon is the rising competition in the social buying business. Since the entry barrier is low, many players have entered the market offering similar kinds of deals. The gap between various e-commerce companies is blurring fast, and leading players in the e-commerce industry, Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY), are emerging as competitors to Groupon. eBay entered the daily deal business last year with a new platform called Lifestyle deals, and Amazon has its presence with its daily deal site LivingSocial.In the last few years, eBay has been innovating with new offerings, such as global shipping programs and varied payment methods to tackle increasing competition from other e-commerce players. Now eBay is focusing on smartphone transactions with the launch of a device called Beacon last month. This device will be installed in stores and will automatically connect with shoppers' smartphones. Money transfer through PayPal requires a GPRS connection or Wi-Fi, but this device will use Bluetooth technology, enhancing its off-line presence. The company expects to generate $20 billion from mobile commerce and payment volume in 2013. We believe this strategy will improve users' shopping experience and act as a growth driver in the rapid shift towards smartphones. eBay has rolled out many upgrades to its mobile app and has acquired 2.4 million users in the third quarter of 2013. Mobile-based services have a significant role in the mobile segment for eBay, and it will be a bigger focus for the company heading into the next year.Amazon has a 29% stake in LivingSocial, which is viewed as a significant threat for Groupon in the daily deal business. Amazon's venture into the daily deal business has so far not been profitable. LivingSocial reported a loss of $25 million in the third quarter of 2013 and has total losses of $106 million in the first nine months of this year. LivingSocial is also diversifying away from daily deals to a large inventory of deals in order to boost its top-line. Earlier it was in the business of generating demand, i.e. they offered deals that users were not seeking.Now they offer deals on products and service that are demanded by users. LivingSocial offers a wide variety of deals including vacation packages and travel deals.We anticipate that the growing competition in e-commerce and saturation of the daily deal business have hurt companies like Groupon and LivingSocial, hence each has to diversify its business to take advantage of the growing e-commerce industry. Groupon has been successfully competing in this business by leveraging its mobile platform, and its future depends on its ability to monetize the mobile segment and drive purchases through its mobile app.Bottom-lineGroupon has a leadership position in local commerce; it has a massive addressable market, but saturation of daily deals poses a strong challenge. The rising competition and saturation in demand may be a headwind for the company and could lead to decline in gross billing in the coming quarter. However, we believe the focus should be on the mobile segment, and the company's initiatives should be too. Groupon has delivered 100% YTD growth in its share price, but it lost around 16% of its value in the last one month due to the ITG investment report. Due to losses, Groupon has a negative EPS of 0.15 in trailing twelve months, but it is expected to show a positive EPS of 0.28 next year. Despite near-term headwinds, we are optimistic about company's future growth prospects and its mobile commerce potential. We recommend a buy on this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1672312,20411,2013-09-04T09:35:27-04:00,,"By Neal RauGroupon's (GRPN) stock struggled after its initial public offering in late 2011, as the stock was down as much as 85% a year after going public. However, 2013 has been a good year for shareholders, who have enjoyed a 90% return YTD. Let's take a look at Groupon, and see why you might want to buy, sell or hold it.In early August, Groupon stock jumped 25% after beating second quarter revenue estimates on the back of strong North American growth. The company also announced a $300 million share buyback, and also said that Eric Lefkofsky would be its new full-time CEO. Although, Groupon is not currently profitable, the company has delivered a one-year EPS growth rate of 89%. After two consecutive quarters of beating expectations, the company is starting to show some stability, which has not been seen since the IPO in 2011. The stock hit a new yearly high after earnings, but pulled back after failing to break above long-term resistance.Groupon still might be in the early stages of its turnaround, as the company continues to benefit from two powerful e-commerce trends, local and mobile. Almost 50% of its business in North America comes from mobile, and over 50 million people have downloaded Groupon apps worldwide. The company has done a good job of fending off smaller start-ups, and even the social networking giant Facebook Inc. (FB) who made an attempt at daily deals a couple of years ago.Amazon.com's (AMZN) Local is just starting to make progress in daily deals, and the giant online retailer might be the best platform to challenge Groupon going forward. Amazon's lightning deals, offered on its website, are similar to Groupon's daily deals. Amazon teamed up with LivingSocial in 2011, another daily deals company, which offers discounted products in Europe, Australia and North America.New competition has slowed the daily deals business for Groupon, but the company is making progress with its other business unit, Groupon Goods, which sells physical goods. Groupon is considering creating a warehouse network for its physical goods business, which would place the company into more direct competition with Amazon.com. In order compete with Amazon and eBay Inc. (EBAY), the company will need to operate with low margins and offer expensive incentives, such as free shipping. The Goods unit constituted $242 million of the company's latest quarterly sales of $609 million, or about 40% of total revenue.Groupon managed to put together a couple of positive quarters, and it appears to have stabilized its business, which is positive for long- term investors too. However, the stock tested resistance in early August, and pulled back. By definition, by rule, we should expect declines to support after resistance is tested, and resistance was tested in Groupon most recently, but not recently enough to constitute taking action right now. By the rules that govern the strategies at Stock Traders Daily, we sell and short when stocks hit resistance and we expect declines to our stated support levels afterwards, so although our combined analysis for GRPN tells us to expect lower levels, we would not initiate new trades at these levels because the stock is in the middle of its channel. When stocks fall back from resistance that increases the risk associated with the trade; we use inflection points to govern entry levels, which in turn govern our risk controls, so the closer we trade to them the tighter our risk controls can be. GRPN has pulled back far enough to dissuade new short positions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receives compensation from the publicly traded companies listed herein for writing this article."
1728872,24278,2013-10-04T10:27:22-04:00,,"(Editors' Note: This article covers a micro-cap stock. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.)Over the last two months, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been on an upgrade parade as four of Wall Street's top technology analysts have all upgraded their sentiment on the stock and the company's future prospects.These upgrades came shortly after Groupon announced better than expected results for the second quarter of 2013. It was Groupon's strongest quarter ever in North America due to billing growth of 30% leading to total revenue of $608 million. Additionally, the company's fastest growing segment - mobile - saw nearly 50% of all North American transactions coming from mobile in the month of June.Since Groupon's earnings report on August 7, the stock has soared 46% ($8.72 to a 52-week high of $12.76). This two-month gain increases Groupon's year to date stock performance to +133% making it one of the hottest technology stocks of 2013. These gains are impressive and the company reaffirmed full year guidance of operating income exceeding $100 million and announced a $300 million share repurchase authorization.For investors holding positions in Groupon this year and over the past two months, congratulations on your stellar gains. With the recent news of Groupon's outperformance, many opportunistic investors will likely join you as new Groupon shareholders following the lead of the analyst upgrades.But there is another facet of the Groupon story that investors may not be aware of yet. If you were doing responsible due diligence of reading Groupon's official press releases, you would not know of this fact. And, if you listened to the company's most recent earnings conference call (August 7, 2013), you would not know of this fact. The only hint to this fact is referenced generally in Groupon's recent 10Q filed on August 8th where you will read about a significant, potential weakness:""The intellectual property claims, whether meritorious or not, are time consuming and costly to resolve, could require expensive changes in the Company's methods of doing business, or could require it to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements.""Therefore, this article seeks to share a relatively unknown and hugely important fact which could potentially impact the future earnings power of Groupon in one of its fastest growing segments, mobile advertising. In short, this could be Groupon's Achilles' heel, a real weakness in spite of overall strength.Patent Infringement Lawsuit Filed Against Groupon by Blue Calypso (OTCPK:BCYP)On July 31, 2012, Groupon was named in a complaint filed by Blue Calypso Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for allegedly infringing on two of its patents (7,664,516 and 8,155,679). The patents cover Blue Calypso's proprietary system for peer-to-peer advertising on mobile devices.Not only is Blue Calypso confident that Groupon's mobile growth is fueled by their patented technology, they have also filed nearly identical patent infringement suits against social marketing heavyweights YELP (NYSE:YELP), Living Social, IZEA (NASDAQ:IZEA), MyLikes, and Foursquare.If Blue Calypso's complaint has merit, it's intellectual property may very well be driving the highest growth segment of Groupon's operations - the increasing use of mobile devices for advertising and commerce. This is extremely significant considering Groupon's North American mobile piece of their entire transactions pie is growing by 10% per six months over the last year.Recent Development Negatively Impacting GrouponSince July 2012, the cases have slowly worked their way through the U.S. District Court. But the last three months have seen major developments adversely impacting defendants including Groupon.Recent Developments in Chronological Order:May 6 - July 18, 2013: Blue Calypso Increases Scope of InfringementBlue Calypso received three new patents (Patent numbers 8,438,055; 8,452,646; 8,457,670) from the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to further solidify their case of patent infringement. With this new firepower in their arsenal, Blue Calypso amended and strengthened their 2012-filed initial complaints against Groupon and the other four defendants on June 13, 2013.July 19, 2013: Four Other Defendants Consolidated with GrouponIn an unexpected order (available at pacer.gov) by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Schneider, the court consolidated all five defendants [Groupon, IZEA (NASDAQ:IZEA), Yelp (YELP), Foursquare, MyLikes] into the one lead case, ""Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc."" for all pretrial purposes, including discovery and claim construction. Therefore, instead of having five separate cases, he ordered one lead case with Blue Calypso as the plaintiff against the five defendants. Groupon fought this development by filing a motion to change the U.S. District Court venue to their backyard of the Northern District of Illinois (this motion was denied last week, more below). This is good news for Blue Calypso and bad news for the defendants including Groupon. Now that the judge has consolidated the cases, defendants must now determine whether they will continue in court against a much stronger plaintiff or settle with Blue Calypso.July 25, 2013: First Defendant SettlesThe first of the five defendants, MyLikes, decided to settle with Blue Calypso instead of proceeding with this case post-consolidation order and post the issuance of Blue Calypso's three new patents. In the settlement, MyLikes has agreed to pay Blue Calypso the equivalent of a 3.5% royalty for the use of Blue Calypso patents.For background, MyLikes is a private company and considers its business ""the largest content and social advertising platform in the world."" Founded and run by two former Google stars (Bindu Reddy and Arvind Sundararajan), the company has attracted the funding and involvement of a team of highly respected angel and venture capital investors including Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures), Paul Buchheit (Gmail Creator), Joe Kraus, Georges Harik, Sanjeev Singh, David Hirsch, Metamorphic Ventures, XG Ventures, Deepchand Nishar and Aydin Senkut.As a private company, public financial information on MyLikes is not available. But with their broad platform reach, top technical talent, and heavily funded advisors, MyLikes's royalty payments to Blue Calypso could become very valuable as the company continues to expand in this high growth market of word-of-mouth marketing.With this strong, credible validation of the Blue Calypso patents, Groupon and the other defendants must assess anew whether to push ahead into a lengthy and costly litigation season with Blue Calypso or to settle out of court with a payment or a licensing deal.August 21, 2013: Second Defendant SettlesThe second of the five defendants and Groupon's competitor, Living Social, reached a confidential settlement and licensing agreement with Blue Calypso further validating the strength of Blue Calypso's patents. The fact that this settlement and the licensing going forward is confidential is very significant. As Groupon's chief rival, Living Social, now appears to have use of Blue Calypso's mobile patents to help them grow. Groupon is now left in the dark as a surviving defendant to what might be a benchmark settlement price for use of Blue Calypso's patents. With Living Social's annual revenue run-rate of over $500 million and with its main investor and 29% owner, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Blue Calypso's hand has strengthened significantly going forward in their negotiating position against Groupon and the remaining three defendants.September 12, 2013: Conference with Plaintiff & GrouponGroupon, Blue Calypso, Yelp, Foursquare, and Izea ""held a telephone conference on September 12, 2013 and identified possible areas of compromise regarding their proposed claim constructions; however, no agreement was reached at that time. The Parties have scheduled a follow-up conference on September 18, 2013 and believe that further discussion may yield a compromise on the construction of some of the claim terms."" (Joint Motion to Modify Fourth Amended Scheduling and Discovery Order, Filed 9/14/13)September 14, 2013: Deadline Extension SoughtBlue Calypso, Groupon, Yelp, Foursquare, Izea file joint motion seeking extension of the deadline to file a Joint Claim Construction and Prehearing Statement to October 4, 2014 (from original deadline of September 20, 2013). In each instance of settlement in this case by defendants (MyLikes and Living Social) to date, both were preceded by motions seeking extensions.September 16, 2013: Extension Granted by JudgeJudge Michael Schneider grants the extension request to make the new deadline of October 4, 2013, for the Joint Claim Construction and Prehearing Statement.September 27, 2013: Groupon's Motion DeniedJudge Michael Schneider issues order denying Groupon's Motion to transfer venue. Groupon was attempting to move the case to their backyard in the Northern District of Illinois instead of the current, plaintiff-friendly venue of the Eastern District of Texas in the backyard of Blue Calypso. This order would keep the Groupon case consolidated (with defendants Yelp, Foursquare, & Izea).October 4, 2013: Joint Statement DeadlineJoint Claim Construction and Prehearing Statement DeadlineEstimated Groupon Settlement Based on MyLikes Licensing Deal MetricsBased on the fact that defendants (MyLikes & Living Social) in this consolidated case are settling with Blue Calypso at a pace of one per quarter, one could logically conclude that more settlements are likely based on these patent validating actions. Therefore, Groupon investors should conduct a risk analysis to understand what a possible settlement would cost the company. What you will find is the cost to Groupon is very significant over the long lifespan of Blue Calypso's patents (13 years - valid until December 14, 2026).By using the MyLikes 3.5% royalty rate as a basis, we can estimate a calculation of what a similar royalty settlement may cost Groupon over the course of 13 years. To be incredibly conservative, this calculation for Groupon's exposure will only be based upon North American (NA) mobile revenue (or 50% of NA revenue reported in Q2 2013 of $377 million). I will also conservatively factor no North American mobile revenue growth at all over the 13 year patent period.Estimating $754 million in revenue per year, a 3.5% royalty on that revenue would equal $26.4 million year or $343 million over the lifetime of the Blue Calypso patents. This royalty hit to Groupon's future revenue would surely be considered a weakness in spite of overall strength.ConclusionWhile Groupon's recent earnings report has caused investors to bid up shares to reach +133% year to date gain, many have no idea of the risk involved in a relatively unknown, high stakes litigation battle which could directly impact Groupon's robust, mobile growth.The risk to Groupon shareholders if a settlement or royalty deal happens is that current and future revenue will be diminished based on the settlement terms with Blue Calypso until the patents expire in 2026. Conversely, Groupon may ultimately be successful in a jury trial verdict in fending off this patent infringement complaint. But, the cost and distraction of litigation over the next 12-18 months will come at a price to Groupon's bottom line and performance.The key Markman Hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2014, with a jury trial expected in Q4 2014. But the way defendants have recently been lining up to settle with Blue Calypso, there may be no defendants left in 2014.We will have to wait and see what Groupon decides to do - mitigate the risk of a jury trial by negotiating a settlement with Blue Calypso following fellow defendants MyLikes & Living Social's calculated decisions recently or let the jury decide their fate. We do know that Groupon has a history of settling out of court for cash awards in previous suits against them as recently evidenced by a recent class action suit against Groupon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (Case name: In re Groupon Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation) which resulted in a settlement agreement of $8.5 million.Going forward, I would caution investors to not expect a play by play via press releases from Groupon's Investor Relations department. The best place to watch the legal action as it happens is by following the flow of court business via pacer.gov by referencing ""cause number 6:12-cv-486, Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc.""I am of strong conviction that MyLikes and Living Social are likely not the first and only defendants to settle out of court with Blue Calypso instead of pressing their luck with individual jury awards for damages that could reach much higher than the $364 million royalty (3.5%) based estimate outlined above in the case of Groupon.Disclosure: I am long OTCPK:BCYP.

1664482,45691,2013-08-29T12:08:25-04:00,,"The daily deals business is getting crowded with some of the global giants venturing in. The social networking giant, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) joined a couple of years ago, but has not been able to pose any significant threat to the more popular Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). However, following late entries by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), with its Google Offers, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Local, Groupon is about to face an uphill task in maintaining its domination of the daily deals business.Interestingly, the giants are coming into contention just after Groupon dismissed its CEO and founder Andrew Mason. However, even a more interesting statistic is the manner in which the company has rallied this year. Groupon is up more 100% year-to-date, despite having posted unconvincing results in Q1, after which, founder and CEO Mason was dismissed. However, now the challenge that remains is to maintain this rally, or at least avoid dropping materially.The second quarter did show some improvements in billings from North America, rising 30%. The company has also appointed Eric Lefkofsky as CEO and, Ted Leonsis as Chairman of the Board, which should help in curbing our uncertainty over leadership. This should offer some hope for investors as the company struggles to turn around its core market business, while leveraging with Groupon Goods.Whilst Amazon Local is just about getting known in the grassroots, the giant online retailer has the best platform to challenge Groupon going forward. Amazon teamed up with LivingSocial in 2011, another daily deals company, which offers discounted products in Europe, Australia and North America. There are some stories suggesting that Amazon could even end up buying Living Social, which would definitely strengthen the threat posed by Amazon Local to Groupon's daily deals business.There are also several other social selling start-ups that have received venture funding and are now competing in the deals business. The low barriers to entry have made it very easy for clones to enter the daily deals business. A good example is BuyWithMe, which is backed by Bain Capital Venture and Matrix Partners, while TownHog has received funding from D.E. Shaw.Additionally, Groupon's other business unit, Groupon Goods, is facing intense competition from eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Marketplace and Amazon. Groupon Goods has been Groupon's best performing unit over the recent past as the slowdown in the daily deals business continues. However, that progress faces a constant threat from ecommerce giants Amazon and eBay, which already enjoy a massive user base compared to Groupon.How does Groupon stack up against the competition?Groupon is still by far the company to beat in the daily deals business. However, the trend over the last few years has been anything but impressive. There are so many clones coming in, and even more shockingly, some of these clones have a better customer confidence than Groupon. Amazon, Google and eBay stand out as major threats, while Facebook's user base is a huge opportunity for the social networking giant.Groupon seems to be fully aware of the risks associated with its daily deals business, and this is justified by its venture into ecommerce. However, as evidenced by Amazon and eBay, in order to succeed in ecommerce, it is necessary to have a payments business. eBay has PayPal, while Amazon has Amazon Payments. Therefore, if Groupon is to mount any challenge to the two giants, it may need to come up with a payments business to support the Groupon Goods unit.The company already has a mobile payments services system, dubbed BreadCrumbs, and has also teamed up with Verifone and Ingenico to widen its mobile payments. Merchants can use these to process card payments instead of dongles attached to their iOS or Android-powered smartphones and tablets.Therefore, will this be enough to help it compete with the likes of Amazon and eBay in ecommerce? I don't think so. As a matter of fact, mobile payment is still a grey area, which is yet to draw global popularity, in the scale of PayPal or Amazon Payments.Additionally, both Amazon and eBay have amazing platforms that attract a bigger user base compared to Groupon's 41 million active customers as of Dec. 31, 2012. eBay on the other hand, has about 112 million and is tipped to reach 200 million by 2015. Amazon leads the ranks with more than 200 million active customers.ConclusionGroupon is up 102% YTD, and has achieved this at the back end of the dismissal of CEO, Andrew Mason, the founder of the company, and a deteriorating daily deals business. The growth in the Groupon goods business has played a major part in compensating for the slowdown in the daily deals business, while the appointment of Lefkofsky as CEO moves to stabilize the leadership of the company.However, all these come at the middle of increasing competition in Groupon's core market, while the Goods business, will be facing an uphill task to get to the level of eBay or Amazon, which dominate ecommerce.The bottom line is, Groupon has already rallied to levels that defy reason, when looking at its outlook and historical performance. The fact that Groupon has seen its daily deals business slow down due to competition from start-ups and the entry by some Internet giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, puts in question its ability to challenge in ecommerce, which has been its best-performing unit over the recent past.Therefore, it would be very optimistic to imagine the company continuing its rally at the current rate. I believe the current rally, which now prices the company's stock at a forward P/E ratio of 35.86, is unsustainable based on the current outlook.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1687582,54532,2013-09-11T12:33:47-04:00,,"Recently, the US retail sector has witnessed a shift in the consumer spending pattern where coupon and bargain purchases are now becoming the new trend. The uncertain economic environment coupled with declining disposable income has been the main cause of this shift towards making more bargain purchases. Companies offering discounted prices and coupons to their customers have been able to thrive even in these difficult times, while companies cutting back on these discounts and coupons were headed towards a dead end. Those in doubt can take a look at where J.C. Penney (JCP) stands right now. After ending its coupon policy, the company began to lose customers to other retailers that continued to offer such schemes to their customers, such as Macy's (NYSE:M).This trend applies equally to large companies and small local businesses. Due to the lack of resources and a proper platform, the smaller companies were unable to reach a wider audience that would have made offering these coupons and discounts financially feasible.Daily deals/local commerce websites emerged as a solution to this problem. It served as an active platform for smaller companies to promote their business and provide special offers. These companies aimed to attract higher traffic and build a loyal customer base, in return for a cut in profits on the coupons sold. This business idea quickly exploded in the US and many companies began to offer such discounts. According to the BIA/Kelsey, the industry reached $1.8 billion in 2011 from minimal existence a few years ago. Specifically in 2011, the total spending on such deals experienced a more than twofold increase as compared to the previous year.Source: Yipit DataDespite the increased competition from the new entrants, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) remains to be the dominant player in the US daily deals industry. Although Groupon offers daily deals to local businesses in 47 countries, the North American market continues to be the major sale point for the company. The company's shares began trading in November, 2011 but soon afterwards its stock price plummeted sharply, dropping below $3 per share in slightly more than a year from the initial value of $26 per share. Although the company's share price has somewhat recovered since then, it still trades at a discount of more than a 50 percent to its initial value.Source: YchartsHistoric PerformanceSource: GRPN Financial StatementsGross billings represent the total dollar amount received from customers' purchases of goods and services, excluding applicable taxes and net estimated refunds. Although Groupon only retains a certain portion of these revenues, this measure gives an insight into the customer traffic and the purchasing power of the visitors visiting the company's websites.After experiencing an initial phase of high growth, the growth in gross billing has significantly slowed down over the periods as the level of competition increased. Gross billings over the periods shown above have grown at a CAGR of 8.7 percent.Although the company has launched its own retail website in the second half of 2011, by the name of Groupon Goods, third party revenues still contribute approximately 69 percent of the company's total revenues. Thus, gross billings have a significant impact on the company's revenue base.The company's revenues have exhibited a similar trend as gross billings, registering a CAGR of 8.4 percent. Initially, third party revenues increased and then experienced a decline in the last 5 quarters. Third party revenues had increased at a CAGR of 16.3 percent and then declined at a CAGR of 5 percent. The decline in third party revenues seems even more surprising when considering the fact that these revenues had grown at a CAGR of more than 50 percent since Q1 2010. The reason being that the increased competition has led to a slowdown in the number of active customers and the proportion of gross billings retained by the company from third party revenues had also fallen by almost 10 percent.Source: GRPN Financial StatementsDirect revenues are generated from the sale of merchandise directly to the end customers. These revenues have increased sharply since the launch of this service in the second half of 2011. Direct revenues increased from around $7 million in Q3 2011 to approximately $190 million in Q2 2013, a CAGR of 60 percent since the introduction of this program. Despite this amazing growth, direct revenues have also fallen in the last two quarters from $225 million in Q4 2012.Source: GRPN Financial StatementsThe graph highlights the reasons for the decline in the performance of the company in the latter periods. The company's gross billings per active user have dropped significantly in the last 6 quarters and the growth rate in the number of active users over the same period has also slowed down sharply. The growth in active users fell from a high double digit quarter-on-quarter growth to lower single digit figures. Gross billing per active user has fallen at a CAGR of 2.2 percent over the last 9 quarters. Thus, a slowdown in the customer traffic combined with lower average spending by the users of Groupon's website resulted in a sharp decline in the company's financial performance.Margins and CostsSource: GRPN Financial StatementsOn the face of it, the company's profitability has improved significantly. The operating margin improved from -39.6 percent in Q1 2011 to 4.5 percent in Q2 2013. It seems that the company will continue to follow this trend in the future. However, I believe it is more important to analyze the driving factors for this improvement in the company's performance in order to decide whether the company will be able to sustain such performance.Despite achieving high growth in its revenues over the years, the company's selling, general and administrative expenses have generally remained under control. These expenses as a percentage of revenues have remained somewhat stationary over the period, increasing to 49.7 percent of revenues from 48.3 percent in Q1 2011. The company's management has been working on building its global sales force and investing in technology and infrastructure in anticipation of growth in the coming periods. Although the costs have slightly increased, these expenses are being incurred to prepare the company for future growth. If the revenue growth continues in similar fashion as in the previous quarters, this ratio will fall considerably in the coming years.Improvements in the returns of the company's equity investments also contributed positively to the reversing trend. Previously, the significant losses coming from these investments were putting additional downward pressure on the company's bottom line. In the last two years, these investments have started turning fruitful for the company as the losses continue to decline sharply.The decline in the company's marketing cost has helped the company in improving its profitability. However, the cost control measures exercised by the management in this area may prove to be detrimental for the company's future growth.Source: GRPN Financial StatementsThe marketing expense as a percentage of revenues has fallen sharply as the company shifts its focus towards spending more on subscriber activation rather than subscriber acquisition. This has led to a drop in the growth of active users of the company's website and platform. In my opinion, this has led to a drastic decline in the company's revenues. I believe that the company needs to equally focus on subscriber acquisition in order to spur growth in revenues in the future.The shift towards direct revenues may lead to a decline in the company's margins in the future. The company generates direct revenues at considerably discounted gross margins and the increasing proportion of these revenues will significantly reduce the company's profitability in the future. This clearly explains the fact that why Groupon should continue to invest in order to increase the user traffic on its website. Thus, the changing revenue mix coupled with the declining growth in user traffic will continue to harm the company's performance in the future unless the company redirects its focus on investing to increase its customer traffic.ConclusionSource: BIA/KelseyAccording to a revised estimate released by the BIA/Kelsey, it is expected that the consumer spending on daily deals is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.8 percent till 2016. As per the research, a large proportion of local business operators are likely to use such services in the future. The increased competition has led to a cut in the percentage of gross sales revenue retained by the daily deals companies. This has made such services more affordable for many local businesses.Despite the positive outlook for the overall industry in the US, the increased competition within the industry, especially the entry of big players, will make it difficult for Groupon to cash on this growth opportunity. Recent results have shown that Groupon, although still a market leader, has experienced declining market share in the industry. Even in the realm of online merchandise, the company will face huge competition from larger and well established businesses. Thus, I believe that the company will either perform at par or below the industry.The competition faced by the company in other regions has also increased over the periods and will hamper its performance in those markets as well. After deeply analyzing the company's performance, I have come to a conclusion that the company is at best fairly priced with a significant downside potential. Hence, I will give a sell recommendation for this company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1861591,22445,2013-11-25T12:18:08-05:00,,"The last time I mentioned Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) I told you the smart money was selling the stock (please consider: Groupon: The Smart Money Is Selling The Stock). While Groupon registered higher price action since that article, nevertheless it does not change my thesis about the company, and that is, the smart money is selling because Groupon is overvalued.Groupon, like many Internet stocks such as Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) have benefited from some sort of social stock craze that is going on in this market. However, eventually the market comes to its senses and marks down the excess price of stocks accordingly.And while many stocks or sectors can remain extremely expensive for a very long time -- giving the impression that this is the ""new norm"" -- eventually what comes around goes around and investors learn their lesson the hard way.Groupon is now getting into the coupon business. While it may be a small change to its business model, I consider the coupon business similar to the business that Groupon is already in, the deals business.However, entering a new business is not an easy thing to do and requires a lot of upfront costs. And if you already don't make any money, as Groupon is not making, then the question is how much of a loss will you report next quarter and if your stock is overpriced as is?(Click to enlarge)GRPN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsAs the data above shows, Groupon is still not making any money and has had zero revenue growth over the past several quarters. And since the coupon business is already a crowded business, with heavyweights such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the space, not to mention RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE), the question is if Groupon will make any money in this business or if it will only lose money.That is the reason why I think Groupon fell over 5% Friday and is also falling today. In fact RetailMeNot also fell over 3%, as a sign that more competition in the space will mean tighter margins.But Groupon has a lot of cash in the bank and can afford to experiment and lose some money to get in the game. It will not go out of business because it is entering the coupon business.So at the end of the day it all comes down to valuations as I have said many times. The question investors have to ask themselves is if Groupon is worth $6 billion when it cannot make any money and when growth seems harder and harder to find. Also, if the stock worth holding onto at these levels. My answer to both questions is no.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Falling in love with any stock will eventually get you in trouble, even if it has worked out for you till now. Eventually the market will take back all your gains and then some.As a reminder, I recommended buying Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) below the $3 level back in November 2012 (please consider: Groupon Finally Lands On Planet Earth). My logic at the time was that the coupon business was not going anywhere, and you were essentially buying Groupon for its cash. Even if everyone thought the company was a goner, I thought the risk reward probabilities -- based on the valuation of the company -- were in our favor.Since then there has been a management shakeout and the company is venturing in payment systems and seems to have gotten its act together. The stock since then has rallied by almost 300% since the November 2012 lows.The question is, is Groupon worth almost quadrupling since my recommendation back then? The answer is no. While the company is doing many interesting things at the moment, in reality not much has changed since November of 2012, except for market expectations. Back then the market was not expecting anything to happen; today the market is expecting the world of the company.Putting aside the fundamental argument for now (fellow SA contributors Bill Maurer and George Ronan did a good job of that recently, and I don't have much to add), there are two elements that investors should take into account recently that might mean that Groupon's rally has reached an end, primarily on valuation concerns.The first is that Tiger Global Management LLC, a major institutional holder of Groupon's stock, recently sold 72% of its position. Anytime a major holder sells that much of a position, most likely it means they don't see much more upside. And personally I share this opinion also.The second item is something that is probably not that apparent, unless you look at Groupon's chart. Please recall what I said a while ago concerning Nokia (NYSE:NOK) (please consider: Nokia: Buying The Dips).The opposite is true on the dips. People think the sky is falling and sell the kitchen sink -- like they are doing these days with BlackBerry (BBRY) -- while the smart money evaluates the opportunity (if it exists) and does the buying.Now let me show you Groupon's chart below.As you can see from the chart above, the first three big spikes in volume happened on dips. The smart money seeing through the daily noise at the time, decided (correctly so) that no matter what the news was that made investors dump Groupon, it was an opportunity to buy.However look at the chart recently, when the stock reached $11. What I see is the smart money dumping the stock. Remember, big volumes happen on the dips or at new highs. As far as I'm concerned, the chart is telling me that the smart money is selling this stock left and right.Bottom lineOn the one hand we have evidence of institutional selling and on the other, we have evidence of smart money selling on the charts. While I like the company, I think that the current valuation of Groupon does not offer much more upside from these levels. I would be a buyer if either the stock corrects, or if the fundamentals warrant higher prices, which they do not at the current time.Coupled with the fact that we have evidence of smart money selling, I think you should sell also.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1682282,38201,2013-09-09T16:09:31-04:00,,"The e-commerce industry is continuously evolving with companies focusing more on quick, easy online transactions. The biggest driver of this industry is the growth of smartphones and tablets. According to eMarketer, a research firm, smartphones and tablets contributed 11% of U.S. e-commerce sales in 2012, and the share will reach 25% by 2017. However, the e-commerce industry is already flooded with many companies, since the entry barriers are very low. In order to grow in this thriving competition, companies must have a unique proposition for consumers. Let's have a look at an e-commerce company, which is trying to make its mark.Last month Groupon (GRPN) announced its second-quarter results for 2013 with revenue increasing by 7% year over year to $608.7 million. It changed its international segment reporting and now reports results in three segments, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Rest of World. This will give a clear picture of the sales and earnings of different regions. Though North America's revenue grew by 45%, EMEA and Rest of World declined by 24%, and 26% respectively. The growth in North America was mainly due to the upsurge in mobile users, which contributed half of Groupon's total transactions in the second quarter of 2013. The international revenue was down due to low sales across these segments.Get going with smart-phone users Groupon is well positioned for the shift to mobile, with around 50% transactions in North America through mobile in second quarter of 2013 compared to 30% in second quarter last year. Smartphone users in the U.S. are expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.31% from 2012 to 2017, reaching 207.40 million. Additionally, online spending has significantly increased. In the U.S., it will reach $248.7 billion by 2014 from $155.2 billion in 2009. This could be the right opportunity for Groupon, to leverage this trend to connect to more users and businesses. Due to the growing smartphone market, online transactions are going to rise. People are becoming more comfortable purchasing online and are even making high value transactions.This will provide Groupon a chance to place high dollar value items on its daily deal space, a place where it displays offers and discounts on its websites. Mobile users spend 50% more on average than desktop users, and we believe that the company has the ability to monetize the same with people using mobile apps more than the website to access the deals. North America has recorded 320% growth in mobile transactions in the last two years, which is expected to continue in the coming years.Moving up with high-end restaurantsGroupon decided to enter the premium reservation business with the launch of 'Groupon Reserve' on both its website and app in July 2013. It allows diners to book high-end restaurants online instantly, and avail discounts up to 40% at these restaurants. Groupon Reserve will run on the technology of savored.com, which is a restaurant reservation portal that it acquired back in 2012. Groupon has over 600 of the country's top restaurants under this program. This launch is in-line with Groupon's strategy of becoming the leading marketplace for online deals.According to Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsk,Groupon Reserve's business model is similar to OpenTable, Inc. (OPEN) and will create competition in the high-end restaurant reservation service. OpenTable has been in the business of restaurant reservations since 1998, seating more than 12 million diners per month across 28,000 restaurants in the U.S. However, Groupon Reserve should be a concern for OpenTable since both compete in the same segment for restaurant reservations. Reserve offers diners heavy discounts on meals at high-end restaurants by using restaurants' unused and vacant seating capacity during off-peak hours, while OpenTable offers diners no-frill reservations that allow diners to book seats in restaurants for no extra charge. OpenTable diners will get dine-in points for each dinning and can later use these points for discounts.Both these online companies have overlapping categories of diners, and Groupon is expected to take some of OpenTable's market share with its heavy discount offers. Looking at OpenTable's 28,000 restaurant base, we can say that Groupon has potential to grow in the coming years.Cause of concernIn July 2013, Google (GOOG) rolled out changes in its Gmail format; it has categorized e-mails into three tabs, Primary, Social and Promotions. This partition will take users an extra click to access social or promotion e-mails. Through this update, Google will eliminate the flood of spam mail in the user's mailbox. This will make mailboxes much more organized and let users prioritize important mail.This will also significantly affect promotion, e-commerce, travel and social content sites that rely on e-mail to attract consumers. These changes are limited to desktop and Gmail app users; email apps on iPhone and iPad are currently unaffected.We believe that for e-commerce companies like Groupon this impact will be potentially more direct. They send their daily deals to all their users through direct mails. In June 2013, Groupon adopted a pull strategy to attract more and more consumers toward its websites and apps, rather than the push concept of sending daily e-mails offering discounts on products and services. Groupon's strategic change from a push model to a pull model has been going in the right direction and will help it to tackle this headwind from Google.ValuationGRPN data by YChartsGroupon has delivered 109.1% YTD growth in its share price, mainly due to improvement in its recent second-quarter earnings result. Let's have a look at the valuation metrics to get a full picture.In comparison to its peer, Groupon has a high EV/EBITDA and PEG ratio, signifying it is overvalued at its current price. Groupon's high PEG ratio indicates that it is trading at a higher price than its future earnings potential. On the other hand, a high EV/EBITDA indicates that Groupon has not been generating enough returns for the shareholders in comparison to its enterprise value.Conclusion The company's stock price has seen growth since the start of the year, but its valuation shows a completely different picture. However, looking at Groupon's strong fundamentals and the monetizing ability on the growing smartphone user base, upside potential still exists. Also, with the newly launched Groupon Reserve, there exists an opportunity to gain market share. We recommend a buy on this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1583292,52532,2013-07-30T10:11:40-04:00,,"Last year Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock crashed from an IPO of $20 a share to a low of $2.6. The company's share price has since tripled, and is currently trading at just above $9. This increase poses two questions; does Groupon's performance justify the rise, and will it continue?Financial PerformanceThe company generated approximately $2.3 billion in revenue during 2012, up from $1.4 billion in 2011. For the three months ended March 31st this year Groupon, Inc. reported $601 million in revenue, an 8% increase on the same period last year. Net losses for the three months ended March 31st 2013 fell to $3.9 million from $11.6 million for the same period in 2012.If considered at face value these figures could be seen to suggest that the company's performance justifies the share price increase, but closer analysis suggests otherwise.The quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue is due to an increase in Groupon's direct revenue, which increased from $19 million in the first three months of last year to $162 million in the same period this year. In contrast, indirect revenue from Groupon's core coupon business fell from $540 million for the three months ended March 31st 2011 to $439 million for the same period this year. Profit margin on the direct revenue is much lower than on the indirect revenue, meaning Groupon's gross profit fell quarter-over-quarter from $439 million to $379 million.These figures suggest that while the top line increase in Groupon's performance indicates a successful half year, the underlying figures that support this revenue increase do not.Upside PotentialEstimates indicate that Groupon's current operating profit margin is 15% in its indirect business, and negative 18% in its direct business.This year the company reported long-term operating profit margin targets for its indirect and direct business at 25% and 8% respectively. Analysis suggests that if sales grow at 12% a year, and Groupon hits these targets by 2016, the resulting free cash flow discounted back at 10% implies a value of $9.70 a share.This means that even if the company meets its targets and sustains revenue growth over the next 3 years, the share price that this performance justifies is only about $1 higher than at present.Expansionary difficultyAt an operational level, Groupon's growth prospects also seem limited. The company is competing with eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for its direct revenue, which makes gaining a sizeable market share difficult. This leaves its coupon derived, indirect revenue. The daily deals industry is still growing, and is forecast to continue to do so, but analysts expect this growth to slow. A research organisation suggests that while the industry is unlikely to collapse, it is due to undergo a correction. The increased uptake in daily deals that occurred over the past 4-5 years resulted from a global decline in real disposable income. As personal income levels stabilize, industry demand will diminish. This will reduce the size of the industry and limit Groupon's potential revenue growth in coming years.Legal DisputeAdding to Groupon's problems is the legal dispute it faces towards the end of this year. Blue Calypso, Inc. is a company that specializes in social media marketing. To date the company has filed three suits against Groupon suggesting it is infringing upon a number of patents.The patents in question protect the use of computer based technology to facilitate advertisers' targeting of consumers based on geographical location. In addition, they protect the provision of promotional content to consumers intended for referral to others via mobile communication devices.Targeting consumers based on personalized criteria such as geographical location, and the peer-to-peer promotion of content, is Groupon's core business. Earlier this year the company announced an updated search system, which enables users to find deals based on location, and is basing a large portion of its growth estimates on expansion of its mobile operations. This suggests that the ruling will affect a substantial amount of Groupon's current, and future, operations.The scheduled venue for the hearings is East Texas. The East Texas District is popular amongst patent dispute plaintiffs because of the historic reluctance of its judges to rule at summary hearings. An out-of-court settlement serves to mitigate the risk of harsh jury judgment, and as a result is often the outcome of such disputes. Settlement could include both compensatory payment to Blue Calypso, and licensing agreements to avoid further infringement. A number of similar cases brought against Groupon concluded in this manner in the past couple of years.If subject to expensive licensing agreements, Groupon will require increased operational efficiency to generate any retainable earnings in the future.Customer valueAnother problem Groupon faces is the value that its core business offers to its customers. Repeat business is crucial to long term growth, but many of Groupon's customers use the company on a one-off basis and then discontinue the associated promotion. In addition to this, many companies cannot afford to offer their products or services at a discounted rate for extended periods of time. This makes it difficult for Groupon to secure long term deals with its clients.Without repeat custom or long term deals Groupon's growth potential is reliant upon its ability to attract new business at scale. This again puts pressure on operational expense, and will make it difficult for the company to generate retainable earnings in the future.ConclusionA number of factors suggest the rise in Groupon's share price could be coming to an end. The company's core business may be sustainable at its current level, but legal costs, retention problems, and industry contraction all limit Groupon's growth potential. This, in turn, limits any further upside to its share price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1658302,24236,2013-08-27T09:35:00-04:00,,"Executive SummaryGroupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) has doubled this year. The stock is up 103% year-to-date, yet has waned in recent weeks after hitting a 52-week high in early August based on earnings. The stock is down around 15% since. I say starting a position in Groupon anywhere close to $10 a share is a great buy.In my article published in November of 2012, I suggested buying the stock. The stock was trading for $4.14 at the time. Since, the stock is up approximately 138%. In the article, I stated the stock was starting to look cheap as it was down 85% from its IPO price. Furthermore, the announcement of significant involvement by shareholder activists Tiger Global Investments, George Soros and Paul Tudor Jones seemed like a talent pool with pretty good odds of creating value. Well, this dream team of talent has proved me right. The team has provided the extra push to get the company firing on all cylinders, fueling the appreciation in the stock. See chart below provided by Finviz.com.The fact of the matter is I don't think the run is over, this is just the beginning. In the following sections I will lay out my bull case regarding Groupon's stock going forward.Recent Quarterly Earnings Quick RecapOn 8/7/2013, Groupon popped 25.9% after beating second quarter revenue estimates on the back of strong North American growth. Moreover, the company announced a $300 million share buyback and ended its CEO search. New full-time CEO Eric Lefkofsky didn't lack for confidence during his CNBC talk. ""Groupon should be one of the great e-commerce companies in the world.""Market ComparisonGroupon looks richly priced when compared to industry, sector and the S&P 500. Groupon is not currently profitable. Where Groupon shines is in the EPS growth category, which just so happens to be the most important as well. A one-year EPS growth rate of 89.95% is very good. The growth rate is much higher than Groupon's peers or the S&P 500 in general.Fundamental AnalysisPlease review the following analysis of key fundamentals regarding Groupon. The tables were provided by Scottrade.ProfitabilityGroupon is not currently profitable. This is one of the factors that make this a speculative stock. I'm bullish on the stock due to the trajectory of the growth rate and the improving profit margins. Groupon is fast approaching the breakeven point, has plenty of cash and no debt. The company is on the right track.Sales GrowthThe stand out statistic was North America revenue. North American revenue, 62% of total revenue, was up 45% year-over-year. North American billings were up 30% year-over-year as well. The take rate rose in North America, but fell overseas.Financial StrengthSomewhat out of the norm, Groupon is in good shape regarding the balance sheet. The company has no long term debt and the current and quick ratios look fine. This puts Groupon a good position strategically. The company does not have to make any desperate moves to stay solvent. This is what you want to see as a shareholder.Management EffectivenessManagement's effective use of company profits and assets is probably the most important data to analyze when deciding to invest in a company. Groupon's management is behind the curve regarding ROA, ROE and ROI. The good thing is these ratios are all improving. The company is in the midst of restructuring as well. As the company matures, synergies will be uncovered and exploited at the same time wasteful operations will be identified and eliminated.Insider ActivityAccording to Scottrade, there have been no insider stock purchases in Groupon. I like to check the insider activity to see if there is any unusual activity going on with insiders. Vast amounts of sells or buying. Groupon's insider report looks good to me.Positive CatalystsCEO SelectedGroupon has named interim chief executive, Eric Lefkofsky, as the company's leader. Lefkofsky has proven himself. He delivered higher revenue for his first full quarter in charge. Lefkofsky has pushed Groupon's mobile strategy. The company said 50% of its North American transactions came through smartphones and tablets, against 30% a year ago. It appears they have the right person for the job.Repeat CustomersAccording to a research note from Piper Jaffray, a July survey of buyers showed that 65% of respondents who had purchased a Groupon deal planned on making another such purchase in the next three or six months. The survey was of 200 Groupon purchasers, and the results are said to reflect the company's recent strength in North America. This is very promising data. This means customers are finding value in the service. Satisfied customers are the most important asset a company can have.Online Marketing StrategyGroupon Inc. is borrowing an online marketing strategy from Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) and others. Groupon plans on paying bloggers a commission for bringing consumers to its deals. The Groupon Partner Network announced Monday gives a restaurant blogger, for example, access to ads for Groupon offers that feature local eateries. This kind of Internet advertising puts Groupon into competition with Google AdWords and Yahoo Bing Network which have proven to be lucrative platforms.Downside RiskCompetitive PressuresGroupon is competing in a highly volatile industry with supposedly low barriers for entry. Who knows where people will go to get a good deal next. Will Groupon be able to keep up with the fickle nature of the buying public? At this point it seems they have the right stuff. Needless to say, this could change on a dime.Execution RiskThe fact that Groupon has done so well so far is a testament to management. Groupon has made in out of the intensive care unit, now it is in the rehabilitation center and will need to perform. The company will need to stay on track to be successful.ConclusionI remain bullish on Groupon going forward. Even though the stock has more than doubled over the past year, the stock still has much more room to run. Furthermore, the recent pullback is actually a great buying opportunity. With Lefkofsky now in full control, the company is definitely on the comeback trail. Groupon is focused on increasing growth and expanding profit margins. I believe it will continue to be successful. If you chose to start a position, I would definitely layer in to reduce risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1633852,24849,2013-08-14T06:13:42-04:00,,"Recently, shares of daily deal site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) soared after the company's second quarter results. The company reported in-line earnings and a slight beat on revenues, sending shares massively higher to their best levels since June 2012. Groupon's stock appears back from the dead, but a bunch of numbers still worry me at this point. Today, I'll look at the potential short case for Groupon.Revenue growth sluggish:As I pointed out in a recent social media article, Groupon was the laggard in terms of revenue growth. Of the seven names I looked at, Groupon's expected 2013 revenue growth was the only one below 10%. It was also the name expected to show less than 40% growth. 2014 revenue growth numbers weren't much better, and Groupon is definitely the name growing the slowest. Groupon's second quarter revenue growth was just 7%, well below many of the other names in this space.But it isn't a slow growth company. Groupon is also announcing the smallest revenue beats. Just look at the table below, showing names like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z). The table shows each name's most recent revenue number and the beat of estimates.So Groupon had the smallest revenue growth figure and also the smallest beat. Investors also seemed to shrug off very weak Q3 revenue guidance. The company guided to revenues of $585 million to $635 million. That's a midpoint of $610 million, and estimates were for almost $622 million. Estimates have come down by about $6 million already, currently standing at $616.77 million.As I'll show later, Groupon's 2014 revenue estimate has come up since my social media article, but its 2013 and 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share numbers have come down. That's in contrast to what we are seeing with the other social media names. Here's some of the changes we've seen to others since:So with analysts increasing all of their estimates on these names, why would I favor Groupon, whose earnings estimates have been cut? It just shows how there may be much better options out there.Gross margin declines:While gross margins did rise by 20 basis points sequentially, they were down by 1300 basis points year over year. The huge fall was due to a shift of more direct sales, and that is a problem. In the latest quarter, gross margins on direct sales were just 11.1%. Gross margins on 3rd party and other sales were 86.7%. Overall, gross margins stand at 63.2%, meaning there is a substantial amount of room to the downside if the company generates more direct sales. What happens if gross margins decline to 50% overall, or even lower, over the next couple of years? Groupon will need a lot of sales growth to offset the fall in gross margins, and are you confident that they can do that given what I've already shown above?Balance sheet update / buyback too late?Along with the earnings report, Groupon announced a $300 million stock buyback. The buyback news probably had a lot to do with the stock's giant rally. On paper, the buyback makes sense given the company's balance sheet and financial flexibility. The following table shows Groupon's balance sheet at the end of Q2, compared to the end of 2012, and last year's Q2. Dollar values in thousands.*Liabilities to Assets ratio.**Closing price of day after that quarter's earnings were announced.Now a couple of the financial ratios improved a little bit, but the cash balance is basically flat over the past year. What's my overall point here? Well, look at the share price. If Groupon starts buying back shares now, at more than $10 each, you are talking about less than 30 million shares bought back, less than 4.5% of the outstanding share count. Groupon obviously has had the financial flexibility to do this buyback for quite some time, so they appear a bit late to the party. Why didn't they make this announcement when shares were at $5.00, or better yet, around the 52-week low of $2.60? This buyback could have been a lot more powerful then, so I believe the company has failed investors in this respect.Does the valuation fit? Still losing money...One important item I pointed out in the social media article was that many of these names are not as profitable as they seem. A lot of these names use both GAAP and non-GAAP numbers for earnings per share, with analysts using non-GAAP for their estimates. Groupon's non-GAAP numbers take out things like stock-based compensation and acquisition related costs.So when you see that the company posted a three cent profit in Q1 and a two cent profit in Q2, you have to be careful. On a GAAP basis, Groupon actually lost $7.57 million in Q2, and $11.57 million for the first half of 2013. The company had a profit of $16.69 million in the first half of 2012, so net income is going the wrong way. So when you see that they are expected to show a 13 cent profit this year, you really need to know the details behind that.So that gets me to the valuation argument. In the social media article, I showed how Groupon's valuation on a price to sales and price to earnings basis was the lowest of all the names. But I argued that the low valuation was due to the lowest growth profile of all the names, which you can't argue against. However, given the Q2 results, Q3 guidance, and stock price rally, the valuation has stretched a bit, and to me that does not fit. The table below shows how estimates and valuations have changed since my social media article.So while analysts have increased their 2014 revenue estimates a little since, they've also taken down their profit forecast as well, and quite significantly for 2013. Look at what that has done to Groupon's valuation, especially for this year. The 2013 P/E has soared by a whopping 55.56%. Is the $300 million buyback worth that much more to you? Don't forget, these numbers are based on non-GAAP earnings per share figures. Groupon has lost money in the first half of 2013, so there may not be a GAAP P/E that actually exists, if analysts were to use GAAP numbers.Additionally, on a GAAP basis, the buyback makes the earnings per share loss even greater. Why is that? Well, if the company is profitable, reducing the share count is a good idea, because less shares means more individual profit per share. But the reverse is true when you are losing money. Less shares means that each share has a larger loss. At current levels, the buyback probably won't do enough to move the needle, especially for a company whose profits and losses are in the pennies. But if Groupon were to start losing huge sums of money on a GAAP basis, the buyback could make the earnings per share picture look a lot worse.What about short sellers?With many of these social media names, one potential risk to the short case (risk to the upside) is the possibility of a short squeeze. In recent years, we've seen a lot of growth names been pushed much higher by short squeezes, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR), just to name a few.But as I mentioned in the social media article above, Groupon did not have an extremely large short interest number. Less than 11% of the float was short, and that number came down at the latest update. A chart of recent short interest history for Groupon is below.With Groupon trading almost 18 million shares a day, the days to cover ratio is under two, meaning it would take less than two full trading days for all shorts to cover. That's not a lot. Don't forget, we haven't gotten an update on short interest since the earnings report, and that will come in a couple of weeks. Groupon traded more than 91 million shares the day after earnings, so it is possible that a lot of shorts have already covered. This could also mean that there is a lot of room for short interest to increase, especially if investors try to short this name after such a huge rally. That's another reason why shares could be pressured going forward.Final Thoughts:Groupon shares have rallied tremendously, but investors might want to think twice before jumping in. Q2 revenue growth was sluggish, and the name's small beat was only due to analysts taking down their forecast after weak guidance at the Q1 report. Q3 guidance was weak, and analysts are already taking down their numbers. The company did announce a $300 million buyback, but it seems a bit late. Groupon's valuation has stretched tremendously in recent weeks, and there may not be too many short positions left to cover. Groupon appears to be a decent short candidate here, but I wouldn't be against waiting for the next pop, maybe a re-test of the recent high. If you are looking for growth, there are many other social media names that offer a lot more of it. Groupon just does not stack up against the rest.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

1649662,39231,2013-08-21T14:43:10-04:00,,"A growing number of active customers, a healthy take rate and a great business model make me bullish on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Also, the company has delivered healthy financial results in recent quarters, and has been expanding its active deal offerings to tap available growth opportunities and to grow its active customer base. Furthermore, analysts have projected an attractive growth rate of 24% per annum for the next five years.Financial Performance The company's revenue has increased in recent quarters. Groupon reported total revenues of $609 million for 2Q2013, up 7% YoY, beating analysts' consensus by $7 million. North America and international markets contributed 62% and 38%, respectively, towards the company's total revenues. Revenues from the North American segment increased by 45% YoY to $377 million in 2Q2013. On the other hand, the company reported revenues from its international segment of $232 million for the recent second quarter, representing a decrease of 25% YoY. Total revenues for the quarter increased mainly due to higher gross billings and an increase in active customers. GRPN was also successful in expanding its gross billing by 10% YoY for the quarter. The chart below shows the total revenues and gross billing trend for GRPN.  Source: Investors PresentationGRPN is one of the few companies benefiting from the increased usage of smartphones in recent years. In 2Q2013, mobile device transactions in North America increased by 30% YoY. Also, approximately 7.5 million Groupon mobile apps were downloaded in the recent second quarter, which led to revenue growth.The company reported an adjusted EPS of $0.02, in line with analyst expectations. GRPN has been successful in increasing its gross margin over recent quarters; it currently has a healthy gross margin of almost 64%. Also, the company has been able to consistently increase its active customers. In the recent second quarter, the company added 0.9 million active customers; it now has a total active customers base of 42.6 million, up from 38 million in 2Q2013. The following two figures show the gross margin and total active customers for GRPN. Source: Quarterly ReportsGRPN has been doing well in terms of increasing its take rate over recent quarters. In 2Q2013, the company enjoyed a take rate of 43.1%, in comparison to 42.7% in 1Q2013. As the company continues to increase and/or maintain its take rate, it will be able to post healthy financial results and the move will positively affect GRPN's stock price.  Source: Quarterly ReportsOutlook The company's management provided a revenue guidance range of $585 million-$635 million for 3Q2013. Also, it expects its full year adjusted operating income will exceed $100 million. In contrast to the company's expectations, analysts have estimated an EPS of $(0.01) for 3Q2013 and have a high next five years earnings estimate of 24% per annum. Following are the analysts' EPS estimates for GRPN from 2014 through 2016.Source: Nasdaq.comRecent News Earlier this month, GRPN named Eric Lefkofsky as the company's new permanent CEO. Eric Lefkofsky was named the interim CEO in February 2013. The news of the appointment was absorbed positively by the market, as the stock rose 19% in after hours trading following the announcement.Last week GRPN launched the Groupon Partner Network (GPN) to help better monetize its online presence via promotion of Groupon deals. As part of its initial promotional efforts until September 30 2013, GRPN has also increased potential commission levels for its affiliate partners.Conclusion I believe GRPN has a great business model and the company has a large addressable market. The conversion rate, converting subscribers into actual buyers, remains a key stock price catalyst for GRPN. The company can increase its active customers and revenues by focusing on 'deal relevance'; targeting customers according to their demands and needs. Moreover, as the company increased its deals offerings, it will positively impact top and bottom lines results in the future. By the end of 2Q2013, the number of deals offered by GRPN in North America surged to more than 54,000, in comparison to almost 40,000 in 1Q2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1526912,23899,2013-06-28T13:39:15-04:00,,"By David GoodboyTake a moment to try to imagine the perfect business.It wouldn't have any of the worries or costs associated with inventory. The business would be able to profit from any product or service in the world without actually having to spend the time and money required to operate the particular business. This business would create incredible value for consumers by providing the lowest prices available for whatever happens to strike a consumer's fancy.In addition, it would create a win-win situation for other businesses by guiding a stream of customers to their front door. Its products and services would have close to zero cost, creating nearly pure profit from each sale. Finally, the company would use the Internet to reach a worldwide client base at minimal expense.There is no need to imagine this perfect business. It actually exists.This theoretically perfect company is the much maligned Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).Launching as one of the most hyped IPOs in history, this daily-deals site has done nothing but smash the dreams of investors from its first days as a public company. Despite exponential growth from 400 clients in 2008 to a present 150 million, the company is down nearly 80% from its highs. Groupon is trading at around 27 times next year's estimated earnings.My purpose is not to rehash what happened or provide ""woulda, shoulda, coulda"" hindsight analysis of Groupon's missteps. I'll leave that to the pundits and armchair quarterbacks. Rather, I want to build a case that Groupon is a potentially profitable long-term investment.Groupon has a market cap of over $5 billion, revenue of more than $2 billion with year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 7.5%. I am fond of following the big-money players, and Groupon does not disappoint with institutional interest. Thirty-six percent of the company is held by insiders, and nearly 64% remains institutionally held. Venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates maintains more than 87 million shares; Tiger Global Management holds another 65 million.In fact, over the past quarter, JANA Partners, Slate Path Capital, Miura Global Management and Capital Tactics Advisors have all increased their holdings in Groupon.Here are three additional reasons I am bullish on Groupon.1. Deutsche Bank UpgradeAn analyst at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) just upgraded shares of the company from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and increased the price target to $10. In addition, the analyst expects Groupon's billings to grow by 20% this quarter.2. Improved Marketing StrategiesTwo types of direct marketing include pull marketing and push marketing. Groupon was focused primarily on push marketing. This is when the company sends out emails with the goal of reaching consumers who might be interested in its partners' products or services.Pull marketing, on the other hand, is the goal of attracting customers to the Groupon site to search for a variety of local deals. In its most recent quarter, 45% of the company's North American business came from smartphone and tablet users, and its mobile apps were downloaded more than 7 million times. While sophisticated spam filters may block push email marketing attempts for many users, pull marketing through the website and mobile apps avoids this issue.In addition, consumers are more likely to purchase several Groupon deals when browsing the website or app rather than just the one featured in the email blast.3. Share MomentumGroupon's stock has been in an uptrend since November: The price is up more than 100% from its sub-$3 November lows. It has broken above both the 50- and 200-day simple moving average resistance levels. The uptrend, now 8 months old, shows no technical signs of ending.Risks to Consider: Groupon faces several factors acting as headwinds. The first is consumer ""deal fatigue,"" which means customers aren't loyal to Groupon and will switch to another deal provider at the drop of a hat. Secondly, deep-pocketed competition springing up from companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is certain to take customers away from Groupon. Last, many businesses have discovered that more than a few Groupon clients are purely deal-driven and will not return to purchase items at regular prices, resulting in non-repeat business for Groupon.I like Groupon on a breakout close above $8. If the uptrend continues, then shares could rise to $15 within the next 12 months.Original PostDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1533952,37451,2013-07-03T14:08:21-04:00,,"I started reading Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) 10-K this spring when it was trading around $5.50 a share. I put it down to focus on studying for my CFA and since then it's rallied an impressive 68%. Though I realized it was probably an exercise in futility, I decided to pick up where I left off and see if there was anything left on the table.The verdict; I'm passing on Groupon and here's why:FinancialsThe company is running at about break-even and if they wanted to, could run the business to make money (reduce marketing expense and expansion). For now however, they appear to be happy flirting with profitability and hoping that a maturing operating strategy leads to bottom line improvements.As for growth, revenue is still growing but its higher margin local business has slowed. And while gross deal margins or ""take"" in the parlance of the cognoscenti are stable at 30%-40% for now, there doesn't seem to be any guarantee they will stay that way. My guess would be that they head lower.On the plus side, the brand is definitely worth something and it is not expressed in the balance sheet. I think you could estimate the brand value at $1-3 billion dollars.The ModelI have to admit that at first, I thought their model would be easily replicable and that they would soon be out of business. But it seems like, despite serious attempts by both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to enter the market, their biggest competition is a private company called Living Social. To me this would seem to suggest that people think of a Groupon and/or its offering structure as a unique product type that they really only want from a specialty provider. Otherwise, why wouldn't they use the sites that already have authenticity and their credit cards (Amazon & Google)? This is the value of Groupon's fist mover advantage, its aggressive growth, and its franchise.Distinct from the question of whether the model can work for companies, is the more interesting question of whether it will work in the long run for their merchant customers. The simple answer is that it will work for some businesses and not for others. The better answer is I don't know, and neither does anyone else. What I do know is there was definitely a fad element, which led some businesses that weren't savvy, and some that weren't the right type, to do deals that had bad economics. There was also fault on Groupon's side, being a young company, it hadn't and probably still doesn't know the optimal deal structure for each merchant it deals with. It will probably take another few years to settle this question, but in the meantime, I think it's fair to assume that the firm is still benefiting from a newness factor and that growth will slow, if only marginally.In addition to the social deal structure that made the company famous, Groupon has been branching out into the direct goods business, and trying to sell itself to Wall St. as becoming ""the operating system for local commerce."" For my money, as long as Jeff Bezos is still at Amazon the company will only make a small dent in the low margin business of direct goods. As for the operating system of commerce, I feel very comfortable assuming Google has them beat.Management & OwnershipLooking over the management structure, I quickly ran into this quote in an article by the AP,This was the nail in the coffin. You don't have to work on Wall St. to know that this is not a good sign. 85% of the IPO proceeds going to early investors and insiders is not capital raising, it's a massive trade and the worst kind.The fact that the founders effectively cashed-out at the IPO would have made me nervous enough on its own but then when I read on about co-founder Eric Lefkofsky, and his exploits at other companies, my uneasiness morphed into plain distaste. This guy seems like a stock promoter of the first rate. I also can't help but be suspicious that they used the eccentric Andrew Mason as the fresh face for their promotional ventures and let him take the fall when things went south.Having said that, I should say that I am sure there are hard working people at Groupon focused on creating a lasting brand that will change the world. I just don't think Eric Lefkofsky is one of them. And though he owns 16% of the company, after the money he's already made it's more like a free option than an ownership stake.Funnily enough, the antics of the founders and weak ownership actually make me think that a takeover is more likely should the company continue to flounder. The logic being that when management gets sick of the hard work of actually running a business, they will be happy to sell it off to a big corporation and take whatever money is left. Unfortunately, that is not a sufficient basis for an investment, at least for me.In SumAll things being equal, I think Groupon was an attractive play under a $4.5 billion market cap, despite the issues with management and profitability, mostly because of its franchise. And though I wouldn't be surprised if it popped up into the $8-9 billion range, I don't feel that you are being sufficiently compensated for the downside risk at these levels.P.S. With the stock approaching the IPO valuation I will be very interested to see if insiders begin selling shares again.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1505472,24776,2013-06-17T11:12:02-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has seen its stock rise 54% YTD. The company, which lost nearly $4 million last quarter, still maintains a market cap of $5 billion. imageJust last Friday, Groupon saw its stock rise 11.5% due to an upgrade from Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB). DB's analyst Ross Sandler raised his price target from $6 to $10. Sandler says that a push by Groupon to provide more targeted searches to customers would allow the company to see up to 20% in billings.Here is why Sandler's price target really doesn't make any sense still. Let's assume that Groupon billings do rise 20% due to this target coupon campaign. Even this would not justify a $10 stock price. A $10 stock price would mean a $6.6 billion valuation.Groupon's business model is about getting a cut of the revenues from companies. While attracting more coupon sales does help revenue, it doesn't mean that those billings will stay. Groupon has to not only satisfy coupon enthusiasts by providing great deals, but also help make sure companies are getting their money's worth.Sandler says that this ""pull"" strategy could turn Groupon around. I have to disagree with this simply because not enough is even known to say that the company should be worth $6.6 billion. I do agree with Sandler that targeting emails to customers based on their preferences will increase the volume of coupons sold. This will increase revenue, but keep in mind, the company still lost $67 million last year.Will a 20% increase in billings lead to profitability? Maybe. Will it justify a $6.6 billion market cap? Most likely not.There is also new competition coming into the space as well. In UK, Barclaycard will has just launched a new service called ""Bespoke Services,"" which will offer similar deals to Groupon. While the service is only in UK, given Barclaycard's strong presence, they should be able to market the new coupon system fairly well.The market seems to have gotten excited about this upgrade. It's possible bulls were just looking for a reason to buy the stock. I still don't understand the current stock price, let alone a $10 valuation. Groupon needs to earn at least $200 million so it can justify the current valuation of $5 billion. This would give it a P/E of 20, which I still consider would be on the higher end given that the company's current business model won't allow for much growth going forward.I encourage investors to stay away from this. The stock at this price is not really even considered speculation. Even if a 20% billing increase were to happen, the stock seems to have priced it in already.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1465391,46531,2013-05-28T16:23:21-04:00,,"I have never been a fan of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) business model. First of all, I think that it is unsustainable to keep about half the money the customer pays for the coupon. But the main problem is that there is a huge trade off between the welfare of Groupon's users and its retailers. This was brilliantly proved in a working paper by Harvard Business School Professor Benjamin G. Edelman: ""To Groupon or Not to Groupon"".Basically, Groupon affects its retailers in 2 ways. First, it has the ability of sending users to merchants en masse, which is both a curse and a blessing. As Prof. Edelman mentioned in an interview last year: ""The day after a Groupon is released, hundreds of buyers tend to swamp a small business unprepared for the rush. That barrage of customers can disrupt service to full-price customers, who may end up waiting for service"". Second, nobody likes price asymmetry, specially loyal customers. Full-price loyal customers may become unhappy after they realize others are getting large discounts.This business model could have been improved, but the company's management team, lead by ex CEO Andrew Mason, only had eyes for aggressive growth. Instead of improving its business model, Groupon became obsessed with growing as fast as it possibly could. As a result, Groupon's stock performance has been very disappointing since its IPO in November 2011. What can you expect from an unprofitable company with a weak business model? As George Roberts from Open View Venture Partners puts it: ""New customer acquisition is critical to taking a business from the startup phase and growing it into a big, publicly traded corporation. But that big corporation you become will simply be a house of cards if you've failed to pair short-term growth initiatives with long-term strategic vision"".Groupon, therefore, may look like nothing else but a problem child. However, there is also plenty of room for hope. I cannot deny the fundamental problems the firm faces. But to my way of thinking, Groupon is problematic, yet promising.First of all, we cannot deny its ability to bring customers to almost any merchant that dares to try the service. Groupon has 41.7 million (18.2 million in North America and 23.5 million abroad) active customers. All of them have purchased a Groupon within the last 12 months. Furthermore, Groupon's user base is growing at a respectable 13% y/y growth rate. Alexa also shows that Groupon's user engagement (as measured by the estimated daily time on site (mm:ss) for groupon.com) could be increasing:Notice also that despite having a somewhat flawed business model, Groupon is still growing its revenue and generting positive operating income. According to the latest earnings call: gross margin dropped, but GAAP operating income is about $21.2 million, or $51.2 million excluding stock compensation.The latest earnings call improved Groupon's upward momentum, as investors were expecting worse results. Curiously, Jana Partners, which also owns a significant number of Zynga shares, disclosed 21.9 million Groupon shares this month. These bullish positions have helped to stabilize the stock price. Not too long ago, back in February when Mason was still the CEO, stock was trading at $4.5 a share. We are talking about a 24% return in the past 3 months!This amazing rally shows that Groupon can live up to investors' expectations. It needs to shift the focus: from pursuing aggressive revenue growth to improving the business model. Installing mechanisms that reduce the welfare gap between users and retailers could be a great way to start. This is not impossible. For example, Restaurant.com sends customers on an ongoing basis rather than ""all at once"", and by doing so they avoid sending hundreds of buyers to a small business unprepared for the rush.It is too early to offer a long term investment conclusion. For the time being, I believe that Groupon's upward momentum will continue. But in the long run, if they manage to shift their focus and attract not only users hungry to get value for money, but also those thousands of local merchants (from small restaurant owners to travel agents) who are not using the Internet to promote their services yet, it could be wonderful.Variant ViewThe following risks could cause Groupon to be a sell:-- Low barriers to entry. Deploying a discounts site is relatively easy, technologically speaking.-- Getting new users is not a problem. The problem is getting new merchants.-- Merchants believe that the main value lies in creating new, potentially loyal customers. Having ""too many customers for a couple of days"" is not a desirable outcome.-- ""Horror stories"", for example this one from a cafe owner in Portland who lost $8000 using Groupon, are spreading fast. This is terrible for Groupon's marketing strategy.-- Low transparency: Some businesses have reported getting better splits with Groupon.ReferencesThe latest earnings call official announcement can be found here.

1438051,22445,2013-05-15T16:36:03-04:00,,"Two of the stocks that I follow closely were in the news today. In both cases, Jana Partners, a leading activist hedge fund has taken about a 3% stake in both companies.The question is, should investors jump on board just because Jana took a large position?Let's start with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). As per my last take on the company, I said that the future value of Zynga lies in its ability to transform from a pure social gaming company to a real money gambling company.I have also said that the price of the stock will be a function of the company's gambling strategy, as it unfolds over time. And the strategy investors should follow is to buy Zynga's stock on weakening and sell into rallies, but always buy at higher lows and sell at higher highs. We stop trading the stock only when we get official word on the company's gambling endeavors.I was ready to call for a short-term sell on Zynga before the Jana news came out. However, when a big player jumps on board and takes out of circulation 3% of any stock, then it is only natural there will be upside pressure. So while there is currently no additional fundamental information about Zynga, the fact that Jana took a stake is positive by default.However if one looks at today's chart, he will notice that while the stock rallied, it was sold off very fast. Also please notice that while volume was higher than normal, it was nothing extraordinary. So the way to play Zynga going forward is to sell it at its current resistance -- around $3.63 -- and then try to buy it back again along the lower trend line as shown in the chart below.However, if the stock closes above the $3.63 level, then technically we have to follow and buy. Because when it does cross above that level, it will be the higher high I was talking about.As for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), things are a little more complicated. For the most part I have been neutral on Groupon for a while now and I was really surprised the stock traded above the $6 level.Groupon is a good business and like I have said in the past the company will continue to be a world class leader in the coupon space, but I don't see many catalysts to be a buyer of the stock at the moment (all my Groupon logic here).The company's latest Q1 2013 results were ok, but nothing to be excited about.The forward P/E of Groupon is about 24, with a P/B ratio of 6. In fact analysts have an average 12 months forward price target of $6.13, which is much higher than today's close. Not many reasons to be a buyer in my book.On a technical note, while the stock was up as much as 7% on the news, the market nevertheless sold the stock and by the end of the trade session, the stock had given back all gains and then some, closing negative for the day (ouch).Bottom LineI continue to like Zynga and I continue to believe that the gambling business will be the main catalyst for shareholders to make a lot of money in the next two years or so. Until then, I continue to recommend swing-trading the stock. So I would be a buyer of Zynga if it corrects, or if the stock were to break above the $3.63 level.As for Groupon, I can't find many reasons to justify why Jana took such a large stake. The business is just fine and the company is holding its own, but other than that, there are not too many things to be excited about. As such, I recommend taking profits for holders of the stock and waiting for a substantial correction to re-enter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1439201,25195,2013-05-16T03:06:33-04:00,,"In ""Zelig"" Woody Allen plays a human chameleon who takes on the appearance of those around him. Tech companies need to adapt to their surroundings as fast as Leonard Zelig. In just a few years Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has already exhibited a chameleon-like nature. It started as a daily deals company, then branched out and built a marketplace. More recently, Groupon is becoming a mobile/local company. The bears have argued that these transformations are a sign of weakness in the business model and there is some truth to that. However, following the huge post-IPO crash a lot of negativity is priced-in and maybe there is room for upside. Groupon's stock price has been resilient lately despite bad news and traded up to multi-month highs. In this article I will analyze the opportunities and risks involved in investing in Groupon. I am bullish on Groupon as it has attractive assets that can used to compete in mobile/local e-commerce space.Investment ThesisThe following is a summary of my investment thesis:Background & Stock PriceGroupon will long be remembered as a high profile IPO flop. However, the stock seems to have bottomed and is now trading at highs that date back to last August.(Source: FreeStockCharts.com)Groupon is even trading above its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages, which indicates a shift in sentiment.Groupon's rally since the November lows is impressive because it has come despite a string of bad news, including the firing of CEO Andrew Mason in February.Groupon released Q1 earnings on May 8. Investors drove down the stock going into earnings, but the results came in a bit better than expected and the stock price rebounded to new multi-month highs. The results were not great and underscored the challenges and opportunities for Groupon in the future.Short InterestGroupon has had high short interest and some of the stock price gains may be attributed to short covering.Currently, Groupon has 34.6 million shares short (source: Nasdaq.com) compared to 660 million shares outstanding and a float of 308 million (source: Yahoo Finance).The short interest as a percent of the float is approximately 11%, which is high, but not extreme.Groupon's average daily volume over the last 50 days is approximately 15.8 million shares. This liquidity means that the potential for a short squeeze is low.The following compares Groupon's short interest to its stock price. The data is bi-monthly through April 30, 2013.(Source: Nasdaq.com)FinancialsOne of the key bearish arguments against Groupon is that the original daily deals business is in decline. The income statement below shows the revenue breakdown between the original daily deals business, which comprises most of the ""third party"" revenue, and the newer Goods business (""direct""), which is the Amazon-like marketplace.Groupon's revenue growth only came from the fact that the Goods business made up for the decline in the daily deals business.(Source: Groupon's Q1 2013 10Q)The problem with this mix shift is that the Goods business has a lower gross margin. Almost all of the gross profit comes from the ""local"" business, which is the daily deals.(Source: Groupon's Q1 2013 Earnings Release Tables)Another source of weakness (and potential opportunity) for Groupon is the international business. The international business provided much of the growth that enabled the IPO, but has recently lagged. In fact, the international business was down year-over-year and generates lower margins.(Source: Groupon's Q1 2013 Earnings Slides)There is no doubt that Groupon's financials show some weaknesses. However, with the stock price down so much, the negatives are not news. The question is if there is value in the stock at this level.One last point about the financials. Groupon has had accounting issues. For a good critique of Groupon's accounting, please see this post from Grumpy Old Accountants.SWOT AnalysisBecause of Groupon's complex situation it is useful to use a SWOT analysis. Here is a summary and the following sections go into each point in more detail.StrengthsOpportunitiesWeaknessesThreatsLarge Base & Attractive AssetsThe next two charts show the potential for Groupon.(Source: Groupon's Q1 2013 Earnings Slides)Despite all the problems over the last year, including lack of management, Groupon increased its base of active customers to 41.7 million. There are obviously many people that find value in Groupon and the company has been able to add to these ranks quarter over quarter. I do not expect much growth in this metric going forward, but it would be impressive if Groupon just maintains this base and find ways to monetize it better.The second chart shows the increase in active deals. Not only do many users stick with Groupon, but the company has been able to get more merchants to offer deals. Impressively, Groupon is also getting merchants to offer long term deals on the site.In the Q1 2013 earnings call, management said the following:""...in March over 60% of all merchant contracts in North America opted to feature in our pool marketplace with a monthly recurring deal which fueled the growth in our active deal count."" (Source: Seeking Alpha)Despite all of Groupon's problems, merchants are also finding value in the company and are willing to sign up for longer term deals.A company that does not lose its customer (and merchant base) despite bad management and many problems has a lot of potential.BrandGroupon's brand was tarnished by the bad press surrounding the IPO. Furthermore, there were lots of reports about merchants not profiting from Groupon deals.Nonetheless, I would argue that there is value in Groupon's brand. There are tons of e-commerce sites and many do daily deals. However, only a few that have the brand recognition to rival Groupon. Groupon's brand awareness is not going away and the company may be able to take advantage of it in the future. Furthermore, Yahoo (YHOO) and AOL (NYSE:AOL) are examples of new management teams leveraging old internet brands.Power Users Represent An Attractive DemographicFortune recently reported, ""Groupon's 'power user,' in fact, is a 42-year-old, urban mom with two kids, household income of $100,000, and an iPhone.""I do not know what this is based on and would like to get more detail from the company about its ""power users."" Nonetheless, this seems like a very attractive demographic with a lot of purchasing power.Cash PositionGroupon's cash position provides downside protection for the stock and gives the company time to work through its problems.As of March 31, 2013, Groupon had $1.166 billion of cash (Groupon's market cap is approximately $4.5 billion).Its total current assets are $1.431 billion compared to total current liabilities of $1.101 billion (including $620 million of accrued merchant and supplier payables).Some would argue that the cash provides little downside protection because of the liabilities. Still, Groupon has cash on hand and should not need to dip into its cash position to fund operations. This gives it time to turn around the business.Mobile OpportunitiesGroupon has been making notable progress in mobile, especially in North America.(Source: Groupon's Q1 2013 Earnings Slides)It would be nice to get a breakdown of the mobile mix by product line to see how much is coming from the Local (deals) business and how much is the Goods business.Nonetheless, Groupon has already achieved a strong base in mobile, which, at least, could make it an attractive acquisition target.LocalThe local merchant space is an attractive frontier that many internet/technologies companies are going after. Groupon's transformation from a daily deals site to a broader e-commerce company gives it a stronger platform for local merchants.Many local merchants have unsophisticated technology systems and limited advertising capabilities. Groupon's various products are addressing this market.For example, Groupon just announced Breadcrumb POS - its point-of-sale solution that runs on iPads.International TurnaroundFrom a financial perspective, one of the greatest opportunities is a turnaround in the international segment. The challenges for the international segment include declining revenue and low margins.For various reasons, Groupon's international operations suffered from lax oversight and lagging technology systems. Management seems focused on turning around the international business and is working to upgrade the technology systems to be on par with the North America business.The following is one example of the opportunities in the international segment. Groupon's international salesforce is much bigger than the North America salesforce.(Source: Groupon's 2012 10-K)On prior earnings calls management discussed the big gap in efficiency between the two segments. It is fair to assume that with better technology systems the gap will close and Groupon's international business will improve. If there is no improvement over the next few quarters I will become more concerned that the problem is deeper.No CEO, Lack of StabilitySince February Groupon has not had a permanent CEO. It is somewhat reassuring that the major shareholder is filling in, but the company needs a more permanent solution.Although this is currently a weakness, it is also a potential opportunity. If Groupon can attract the right person, the next CEO may accelerate Groupon's turnaround and act as a catalyst for the stock.Decline In Daily Deals BusinessAs mentioned above, Groupon's core business has been in decline. Although it is making up for this with growth elsewhere, it is important for the company to, at least, stabilize the daily deal business.Deal Fatigue and Yelp EffectThe biggest weakness for Groupon has been the assaults on its business model.Many have said that users are tired of getting daily deal emails and the amount of quality deals is limited. The hype about daily deals quickly passed.Although this concern will always exist, Groupon's shift from a ""push model"" to a ""pull model"" means that it is becoming less relevant. An increasing portion of Groupon's business is coming from users actively looking for deals or goods on Groupon and not from emails.A bigger concern for Groupon is the theory that it attracts customers that merchants don't want. A few years ago some merchants complained that they lost money by offering Groupon deals. A Groupon deal does not work for everybody and it makes sense that it took time for the company and merchants to figure out how to best use deal promotions. The fact that Groupon is now signing up merchants for recurring deals shows that there is a critical mass of merchants that utilize Groupon successfully.Nonetheless, it seems that Groupon is always going to face the allegation that it is bad for merchants. A 2012 paper ""The Groupon Effect on Yelp Ratings: A Root Cause Analysis"" stated the following:CompetitionGroupon faces a lot of competition. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is its most direct competitor, especially Amazon's Living Social unit. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is another significant competitor. In addition to competing with Groupon's marketplace, eBay also has solutions that compete with Groupon's new products. The daily deal space has lots of participants that all compete with Groupon on some level.EPS Estimates & ValuationThe following are analyst EPS estimates for Groupon:(Source: Yahoo Finance)If Groupon succeeds there could be significant upside to these EPS estimates. Because the business is in transition and lacks a CEO it is hard to make projections for the future. Analysts probably prefer to err on the side of caution.At the current valuation it is hard to make an argument that Groupon is overvalued or undervalued. It is more important to see if there is positive or negative momentum in the business.CompsGroupon has a unique business model, so I use three sets of comps:The following is a comparison of Groupon and its comps:ConclusionsThere are many risks involved in investing in Groupon and it has experienced many problems since its IPO.However, I am interested in Groupon because it has grown its large base of customers and merchants during this turbulent period. Furthermore, the company is successfully transitioning its business to mobile and to a ""pull model"" instead of an email-based ""push model."" Groupon's cash position gives it time to turn around the business and figure out ways to better monetize its customer base.Finally, Groupon's assets could make it an attractive acquisition target for a number of companies. E-commerce companies like Amazon or eBay may be interested in buying it to put it out of business and capture its customer base. Adtech companies like Google or Yahoo may be interested in extending their e-commerce platform and capture the synergies on the salesforce side. Finally, traditional retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) may be interested in Groupon to accelerate their push into e-commerce.Groupon's stock price reflects a lot of negative sentiment. It has challenges ahead, but also opportunities. I am bullish that Groupon can capture some of the opportunities, which may drive the stock price higher.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed above should not be construed as investment advice.

1431961,44981,2013-05-13T23:57:25-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has created a virtual marketplace capitalizing on the concept of e-commerce. The company has two major businesses; North America and International. Groupon has focused extensively on the domestic market which has been the major driver of its growth both in terms of operations and financial health. The company currently has 41.7million customers globally. Groupon has recently introduced a number of new business segments which are expected to fare well for the company in the long-term. Gateways and travel business are some of these new segments. The company primarily operates through providing discounted deals.Groupon is relatively geocentric in nature and has churned disproportionately higher growth figures from North America. Although the CEO in the latest quarterly conference call highlighted the importance of international market penetration. He also pointed out plans to introduce a unified system to cater for both the North American and International market via a single playbook. Groupon went public in 2011 but since then its share price has plummeted 82%, only picking up recently.First Quarter ResultsThe first quarter results were above analysts' estimates. The company performed much better on a number of financial and non-financial metrics sequentially although a relatively mixed result was seen on a year-over-year basis. Gross billing improved 4% on a year-over-year basis, North America saw 23% growth, while the international business was down 9%. Operating profits were up 12% in North America while only slightly up (4%) in the international business segment.The bottom-line improved by 8% primarily due to the strong growth from North America (42%) although it was offset by declines in growth from the international business by 18%. It is important to note that despite the positive bottom-line, gross profit margin from a year-on-year perspective was down 14% but improved 15% on quarterly basis. Total units, a major non-financial metric gauging business performance was up 4%, mainly dragged down by a decrease in the company's international business (18% down), while the U.S. business witnessed an increase of 37%. The company has $1.2 billion on its balance sheet and is investing heavily in emerging markets.OutlookIt is important to realize that Groupon is a relatively new company, only four years in existence. In that time, it has grown massively in terms of clients and deal traffic. There are almost 60 million regional merchants worldwide and Groupon at this point in time captures only 1%, so the upside is tremendous. The company has ventured in to a business whose potential has not been tapped into, and it gives Groupon considerable room to grow. Considering the surge in mobile phones and technology-driven consumption in recent decades, a virtual marketplace (with the kind of offers that Groupon provides) is a relatively new concept.One important figure this quarter was the number of mobile apps downloaded. The mobile industry has grown very fast and very quickly over the last few years especially with the inception of the Smartphone. 5 million apps were downloaded in the fourth-quarter, which increased to 7 million downloads in the first-quarter of 2013. This constitutes about 45% of North America's total transactions and is expected to grow in the future.The interim CEO pointed out that the mobile customers are more active, healthier and they buy more, on average over 50% more. Management is very focused on the mobile sector and pointed out in the earnings call that they see mobile as an exciting avenue for growth. The company is trying to tap into the mobile segment, as more and more people are interacting with the world around them through their smartphones.ConclusionAnalysts are divided if the latest quarter's result were just a one off or if it is a sign of a company that has turned the corner. I think Groupon's economics are very sustainable and growth-oriented. The company has ventured into uncharted territory by introducing the concept of a virtual marketplace providing goods and services at a discounted price. The growth prospect is huge. The company is currently operational in 48 countries. There is a lot of potential in the emerging markets with mobile phone sales booming and with increased consumer awareness and higher economic growth rates. The company is in a business of expanding the customer reach of other businesses. Some 60% of the U.S. merchants have renewed their contract on a monthly basis, indicating stronger merchant retention for Groupon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

GRPN has a 33% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 1 of the 3 earnings reports for which we have data).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 1 qtrs- Met whisper: 0 qtrs- Missed whisper: 2 qtrsOur primary focus is on post earnings price movement. Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day time frame:The strongest price movement of -24.7% comes within ten trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and +47.3% within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. The overall average price movement is opposite through thirty trading days when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:Last quarter the company reported earnings twelve cents short of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 28.9% loss in after hours trading, but gained it all back by seeing a 35.4% gain in twenty trading days.

1436151,48641,2013-05-15T08:16:24-04:00,,"The termination of Groupon CEO Andrew Mason was not just your everyday firing. Let's be honest about it, it was an outright sacking. Mason will receive a severance of just $378.You heard it right. That's not $378 million, but $378. But before you shed a tear for fallen CEO Mason, there's much more to this story than meets the eye.It's also important to know that the quick descent of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) may only be the start of something much bigger to come, that the problem may not lie with just Groupon, but may be systemic to the industry as a whole.The bigger pictureWhile it's true Mason gets just $378, that's only because the severance package calls for six months pay, or half his annual salary. Mason walks with a 7-percent stake in the company worth almost a quarter billion dollars. While that's down considerably from when the company was trading in the mid-twenties, it's still a tidy sum. Groupon now trades below $6 per share.So why go on about Mason's good fortune? Because it ties in directly with the underlying problem of the Groupon business model itself. This is a problem that extends far beyond Groupon and into the industry as a whole. This may very well have an impact on similar companies like LivingSocial and their ability to raise capital through initial public offerings.The failure of the Groupon business modelThe lessons learned from the fast-growth business model of Groupon can be found in its stubborn adherence to new customer acquisition, while ignoring customer retention almost altogether. This is a lesson for all companies looking to go public. While growing as fast and as big as you can might increase share value in the short-term, it's a recipe for long-term disaster.What you wind up with quite frankly is a house of cards. The problem with the Groupon model on the ground was that while it initially brought in new customers to businesses, these new discount-oriented customers did not turn into long-term, full-price clientele. The traditional model for coupons is to bring in new customers at a deal just for the one time, then keep those customers for the long run paying full retail price. As it turned out, Groupon customers were demanding the discount every time.The facts on the ground, a true-life story of failureJessie Burke found out the hard way that while Groupon might pack customers in, there is little if no profit to be made. Coupons are meant to drive new clientele into a place of business, not only with the hopes of repeat business but that these same customers will spend over just the value of the deal. For Jessie at Posies Café, the deal turned into a nightmare.Not only did the deal seekers Groupon sent her not turn into regular customers, rarely did they even spend over the deal value. Instead of receiving maybe $5 over the deal value, Jesse found she was getting more like 10 cents. The Groupon business model was designed for maximizing profits for Groupon, not its clients.Groupon's failure on Wall StreetThe failure of the Groupon business model means a steep decline the company's share value. Shares now trade well below the Initial Public Offering high of $31.14. The stock closed at $6.36 on May 13, more than ¾ off its all-time high but still up from its low of $2.60 on November 12.So, is Groupon a good buy at these low levels? Some analysts believe there is still room for the stock to grow and have even upgraded its outlook.Shares in Groupon shot up 14 percent on May 9th after the company reported 1Q results better than Wall Street estimates. Groupon reported for 1Q that revenue was up 7.5 percent. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffary was so enthusiastic in fact that he raised his price target from $7 to $9. But for a stock that's already up 200 percent from its lows, it's this investor's opinion that as a momentum play, the boat has already sailed.As for a buy based on fundamentals, they just do not seem to be there. Yes revenue is up, but from the bottom there really is nowhere else to go. While Groupon did bring revenue in above analyst expectations, $601.5 million over $590 million, still the company lost $4 million. Investing in a company that is losing money is not sound investment advice.While the company may be bouncing back a little, it's important to remember that back in late February share value took a 29 percent hit on weak holiday sales. It was on February 28 that analysts downgraded the stock from an ""outperform"" to an ""under perform."" All it takes is another round of bad numbers and Groupon could be headed back down to the $2 range, or even farther.If it's long shots you like, you'd have a much better chance at the horse races, or maybe at the slots in Vegas. As either a buy on fundamentals or just buying on the bounce, Groupon seems to now fit neither criteria. Best advice on investing in a dying company in a dying industry, just let it rest in peace.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1413051,38211,2013-05-08T05:53:33-04:00,,"Today, after market close, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will release its latest quarterly results. After three straight quarters of earnings letdowns, options traders are counting on Groupon shares to surge after the next earnings announcement. Trading in $6 call options, far out of the money, accounted for about 40 percent of the total volume in the company's options on Monday, indicating that investors are looking for a movement of at least 15 percent following the earnings reveal, while also limiting their risk if the company takes a plunge.Groupon became famous for its popular daily deals, which allowed shoppers to take advantage of huge savings retailers. But a few months after the company's IPO, that niche lost its popularity, forcing the company to revamp and restructure as I discussed in my previous article, entitled 'Does Groupon's Stock Jump Have Cushioning?'. Regardless of worries about the company's future, Groupon's stock has gained 35% in the past 6 months and this earnings announcement will back up the validity of that growth. Further, the stock has been hit with strong volatility, falling 7% over this past weekend.For this quarter, analysts are expecting an EPS of $0.03, which is down almost 50% for last year's estimate, and a Revenue Estimate of $588.92 million, which is also down-- but only by about 6%. But most importantly, investors are looking for new ventures the company's management plans to take on to increase its infrastructure.What Investors Are Looking For?Analysts seem nervous about Groupon's earnings, having reduced their estimates in the past few months. With first-quarter estimates off $0.02 per share and the full-year 2013 consensus down twice that amount, what's surprising is that the stock has managed to post a 4% gain since late January.Competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), LivingSocial and countless other knockoff daily deal offerings like Dans Deals, forced Groupon to turn to reselling overstocked merchandise from manufacturers, a much lower-margin business. Moreover, the company has had difficulty trying to turn to the Chinese market for potential expansion, as Chinese e-commerce Alibaba has asserted its dominance over its home market.Groupon is also trying to make itself more mobile-friendly by adding search features to its mobile apps. If customers can make purchases more easily, then the improved apps could create some growth avenues for Groupon.In Groupon's quarterly report, investors will be watching to see whether its efforts to reach out to its network of business customers can bear fruit in bringing new business to the company. Moreover, if projections for the coming quarters falls short of the growth that investors want to see, then the stock could post sharp declines.Groupon Options Heating UpOption traders are stacking the deck with short-term bullish bets. In midday trading yesterday, overall call volume was running about four times heavier than usually, with roughly 25,000 options on the tape. Nearly half of this volume has traded at one strike, the weekly 6-strike call, where the 12,000 contracts traded easily trumps existing open interest. A number of mid- to large-sized blocks, 300 to 500 contracts each have gone off at the ask price, and all told, 60% of today's volume at this out-of-the-money strike crossed at the ask, for an overall volume-weighted average price of $0.28.Implied volatility has shot up more than 61 percentage points to 184.2%, well above Groupon's one-month historical volatility measure of 43.7%. Option traders are wagering on short-term upside for GRPN, and are likely hoping Wednesday's earnings report helps boost the shares.Break-even at expiration on Friday afternoon is $6.28 or 12.5% above the stock's current price of $5.58. The at-the-money (5.50 strike) straddle expiring this Friday is currently priced at $0.81, or 14.5% of the stock price, meaning, the options market expects a 14.5% move in either direction before Friday's closing bell. Lastly, the option's delta currently stands at 0.38, giving a slightly less than 2-in-5 chance at an in-the-money finish on Friday.Recent Hit To Its Share PriceShares of Groupon recently plunged, falling 7% from Friday's close of $5.85 to yesterday's close of $5.39. The fall came after analysts from Piper Jaffray announced that they were expecting the group discount site's revenue outlook for the June quarter to miss estimates. Further, Groupon announced that Faisal Masud, who played a large part in Groupon Goods e-commerce system, was leaving the company to possibly join office supply giant Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).Masud's departure was disappointing for investors, since Groupon Goods, its e-commerce arm for discount goods, had been considered one of the company's only remaining bright spots. Masud's departure comes only two months after the company fired its founder and CEO, Andrew Mason.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1334731,38451,2013-04-11T10:20:20-04:00,,"Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) is a stock that I have been accumulating recently. GRPN's stock price has plummeted from $30 in late 2011 to the current price of around $6. Recently, a change in trend has been seen and I like the potential of the company going forward. Most of my friends and co-workers use GRPN on a daily basis and the recent coupon with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) created a lot of hype on GRPN.The companyGRPN operates as a local commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount. It serves over 150 markets in the U.S. and over 100 markets in Europe. Unlike advertising, the merchant pays nothing to advertise the ad. GRPN takes 50% of the cost to buy the coupon, whilst the company keeps the rest. For example, if a coupon is selling for $50, Groupon will keep $25 of the cost.FundamentalsThe company has a valuation of $4 billion. What excites me is the fact that GRPN has $1.2 billion in cash and $0 debt. This negates the need of any secondary offering of shares. Also this huge cash position will create an ideal scenario of buying back shares, as the float is huge at 300 million shares. I expect that the new management will take this into consideration in the next earnings call in early May. The cash position can also be used to buy any small and upcoming companies.One should also note that GRPN has 41.7million shares short. This is approximately 21% of the float, which is huge, and one can expect a short squeeze to take GRPN higher eventually.The company also has 11000 employees. I believe this number is too big considering this is an online marketplace. It would be nice if management does something about this too.CEO's departureIn March, GRPN announced that management had fired the CEO. I believe the company is now turning around. I am hoping that the new management that is brought in can turn things around, and whilst this can take a few earnings reports, I like the chances here.Earnings analysisThe last earnings report by GRPN was impressive. Q4 provided the best evidence yet that customers love groupons. Firstly GRPN announced that it had its strongest sequential increase in absolute billing dollars in its history, growing more than $300 million, stronger than its previous record by over $40 million, and growth re-accelerated to 25% quarter over quarter. There was a reduction in local margins in the last quarter and more top merchants were attracted to do business with GRPN. Mobile accounted for 40% of the company's overall revenue, up from 33% in the previous quarterAs more and more people start using GRPN, I expect big numbers in 2013. The company is forecasting $56 billion in revenue for 2013, and with a market capital of $4 billion, I think this is a very cheap price at around $6.Technical analysisLet's have a look at the daily chart. Once can see that the price is now over the 4-, 8- and 50-day moving averages,  indicators I use that show that institutions are loading and supporting the price. Note that the break of the descending trend line is taking shape, something that will create higher prices. The next resistance is the gap fill at around $6.60. Also note that a golden cross just occurred recently, where the 50-day and 200-day moving average crossed over. Another bullish sign.The weekly chart is also an interesting one. One can observe how there is resistance at the 50-day moving average at $6.27. I expect this to clear it shortly. Also two nice hammers in the last two weeks.ConclusionThe bears will come out in full force to tell you that GRPN faces big competition with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) coming up with their ideas. Others will tell you that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is where buyers usually shop. I beg to differ.I remain a buyer in GRPN both in stock and May calls and leaps. I like this stock for 2013 and will be adding on any dips. The recent management changes, the return to profitability for 2013, the huge cash position and the big percentage of float being short are enough reasons to believe in the company and to stay long for the upcoming year.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

1324171,33311,2013-04-05T16:23:00-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has taken its fair share of lumps over the past year. After going public to much fanfare, the company has been mired in controversy. Prior to going public, the company was forced by the SEC to restate its financial statements because it was overestimating revenues. The company was recognizing the full amount of the revenue per coupon as revenues when it should have only reported the amount of money it was entitled to. For example, if they sold a $50 coupon for $25, Groupon would be entitled to $12.50 of that coupon while the merchant would get the remaining $12.50. Groupon argued that it was the responsible party for the transaction and as a result it was entitled to recognize the full amount of the transaction with the $12.50 going to the merchant being recognized as cost of goods sold. The SEC didn't buy their argument and forced them to restate their revenues in the S-1 filings when they went public. While this didn't have an impact on the bottom line, it did cause uncertainty right off the bat when they went public.The company expanded too fast, causing revenues to explode and losses to expand. After going public at a $13 billion market cap, the company's valuation plunged to under $2 billion. Executives had to be questioning founder Andrew Mason's controversial decision of turning down a buyout offer from Google for $6 billion just 18 months earlier.Speaking of Mason, the quirky affable leader that founded this business back in 2008, was recently ousted due to poor performance and a lack of direction. The company has had many different forays into trading retailing (putting it in competition with retailers like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the discount online retailing space), travel deals (competing with Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and other ventures that have left investors confused as to what the company's long-term objectives are. And the stigma of having turned down a buyout offer that would have enriched every investor and employee was a hard one to overcome.With all of this in mind, the brand is still a recognizable one and is the first one people associate with when they think of coupons. There is a lot of value in the business because of this brand recognition. And if you have followed any of my articles you will know that I love potential turnaround stories. Especially ones where sentiment is very negative and not that many analysts are following the turnaround (the latter not being the case here, though).So let's take a look at recent trends in a few key metrics to see if the stock warrants a second look.Gross Margins:Gross profit (revenues less cost of goods sold) as a percentage of sales. I always look at recent trends in this ratio as a starting point to see if the company has been able to stabilize its most basic operating metric. Take a look at the past 5 quarters' gross margins to see what the recent trend is:Clearly the trend is bad. From 80.5% down to 55.8% in 5 quarters. Yikes.Expenses:The next thing I look for in turnarounds is to see if they can keep expenses in check. If a company can show positive gross margin trends and operating expense trends then it means they have right-sized the business and only have to focus on growing revenues going forward. When a company gets expenses as a percent of revenues down and gross margins stabilized or are improving, it tells me that the management team has a process in place for maintaining profitability and can hone in on growing the top line to spit out impressing bottom line numbers. Look no further than the impressive turnarounds in Pier 1 (PIR) and Nautilus (NYSE:NLS) as proof of what happens when these two metrics are kept in check. As I said, it frees the company up to focus on growth.Anyway, let's take a look at the recent trends in expenses as it relates to revenues:These numbers are excellent. And improvement of 26% in the past 5 quarters is nothing to sneeze at.What about Growth?With Groupon, one metric I like to look at is the growth in active customers. Obviously this metric gives insight into how quickly it is growing but it also can show you how much money they are making per active customer. If that number is rising then the company is offering enough additional services / products of interest that are of interest to their customer base. Here are the most recent trends in this metric (#'s are in 000's):Growth has slowed considerably in this number.Conclusion:The trends in gross margins are pretty bad. However, there is a silver lining in that if Q4 2012 was an outlier, consider what the bottom line would have been if Q3 2012 margins were maintained. They would have generated over $64 million in operating profits. By keeping costs as a percentage of sales down and trending lower, the company is opening up the door to profitability in the future. It is still too early to tell if the company can get back to just its Q3 2012 margins. If it is able to do this and continue tapping into its huge customer base with additional offerings like Groupon Goods, while maintaining strict control over expenses, the recipe is certainly there for sustained profitability going forward. Clearly, the stock is suggesting that a bottom is in. After having bottomed in November at around $2.60 the stock is up 125%. And after a big drop on earnings on February 28th, the stock is back to where it was trading before earnings. Right now, though, I think we need to see how Q1 2013 numbers look, particularly how the gross margins look, before betting on this turnaround. It is interesting but not quite there for me.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1391191,48561,2013-05-01T16:44:48-04:00,,"In yet another rebuke of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) accounting methods, Anthony Catanach drew attention to the intangible assets sitting on Groupon's balance sheet. Whilst he noted the danger of Groupon's high intangible assets, it is so serious that it warrants a more in-depth analysis.Intangible assets encompass a wide variety of non-physical assets such as patents and goodwill; however, unlike physical assets, such as cash or equipment, they exist only on paper and so are difficult to value. The valuation of intangibles therefore relies heavily on the estimates and judgment of the company - and Groupon has a less than stellar record in its accounting and reporting.At first glance, the picture is not too awful - Groupon's intangible assets account for 15% of it total assets.As shown above, Groupon's proportion of intangible assets appears roughly inline with its peers. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) both have higher percentages of intangibles (at 20% and 26%, respectively) whilst Linked In (LNKD) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) are both lower at just over 10%.Things begin to get scary when reviewing what the intangible assets comprise. Google has a pile of valuable patents (many from its Motorola acquisition) and eBay has some prime acquisitions such as GSI Commerce. Groupon's intangible assets, by contrast, are far less compelling.The largest chunk of Groupon's intangibles is Goodwill, which accounts for $207 million of the $310 million total. Goodwill is created when another company is purchased (technically it is the excess of the amount paid for the company above its net asset value). However, Goodwill can only continue to be carried on the balance sheet so long as its value is not substantially impaired. If the current value is substantially lower, then it should be written off against profits. This is exactly what happened to HP (NYSE:HPQ) with the write-down of its Automony purchase. The companies Groupon purchased were primarily in the ""daily deals"" space, and we need only look at the share price of Groupon and the travails of Living Social to gauge how well daily deals businesses are faring. It is therefore a very reasonable conclusion that the goodwill on Groupon's balance sheet could be ripe for a write-down.Next up is deferred tax assets of 85 million. These are strange accounting curiosities, the validity of which is an ongoing debate. But one thing is for sure, a deferred tax asset is only useful if a company will generate substantial profits (in which circumstance the deferred tax asset can offset a future tax charge). Groupon, having failed to generate any profit to date, is a pretty poor candidate for having what amounts to a profits tax credit sitting on its balance sheet.Finally, ""other intangibles: of $43 million. For a tech company this would normally include patents and developed technologies; however, Groupon, with a zero research and development expense, is not a technology company. As such, there are some curious items in here - ""subscriber relationships"" of $21 million and ""developed technology"" of $11 million. Given the rapid decline of the daily deals business, the subscriber relationships are unlikely to have a significant value (let alone the value Groupon ascribes to them); the developed technology is equally dubious, given Groupon's zero R&D.We have seen what substantial write-downs can do to the profitability of a company like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or the share price of HP. What, then, a major write-down would do to a struggling company like Groupon, which has yet to turn a profit, its rather ominous.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1527482,42111,2013-06-28T22:51:41-04:00,,"Most investors have heard the ""Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) story."" It was a much-hyped Internet ""daily deal"" website that grew really large, really fast. But just as that sales growth put it on the map, and the road to an IPO, other analysts (at Forrester Research) said that the business model was untenable. Then after the large IPO in 2011, the stock slid steadily downward from $31 with investors possibly knowing that something was up. Then a few months after that IPO, with the price by then near $16, the company stated that it had identified ""material weakness"" in its financial controls and revised its 4Q 2011 revenue numbers. That's never something you want to hear. As you could expect, the stock kept heading down until it reached $2.60 per share this past November. Class action lawsuits ensued, and on March 1st of this year, CEO Andrew Mason was fired. At that point, the stock had actually bottomed and was near $5 a share, still a huge markdown from its IPO price. It is from that point onwards that the stock has really rallied. Now the question is how long will it take for the temporary CEO Eric Leftkofsky, and management, to implement better operational efficiencies. The company held its Q1 2013 earnings call last month, and that is a good place to start.Quarterly Report and Conference CallAs the CEO mentioned in his first few statements from the conference call, he has been a part of Groupon since the beginning, having even provided seed money to Andrew Mason. But CEO Leftkofsky is different than Mason because he has experience running other tech companies, and that has been part of the reason for the stock price increase since March.The other reason for the stock price increase is the implementation of the new and improved business model. This new business model moves away from their previous ""email model,"" and shifts to a version that requires less marketing because the customer can search for what they want. The new model also focuses more on mobile, with revenue from that now accounting for 45% of total business, versus only 20% in 2011. This can be seen in the downloads of the Groupon app -- 7 million downloads last quarter alone, and 40 million total.The company's new Deal Bank Inventory system allows it to offer ongoing deals instead of just one-time deals. This was a large change, but merchants have embraced it. It allows Groupon to offer many more deals on a day-to-day basis, and spend less money and virtual shelf space doing so. This also ties in nicely with its search engine, because now customers can more efficiently search for certain type of deals, like specials on Ethiopian restaurants -- the type of deals that previously may have only been available every so often, but that are now available consistently through the Deal Bank Inventory.The project to build a single operating platform -- project One Playbook -- is on track to finish by the end of the year, and that should also improve operational efficiencies. As part of this project, Groupon is developing: a customer personalization algorithm; a merchant return-on-investment calculator; and a lead management system to help manage efficient merchant contacts. These should help internal efficiencies and make Groupon more attractive for merchants. This should all help improve margins and add to the bottom line.The past quarter shows domestic growth that was partially offset by declines in international markets. This is partially due to Groupon's recent focus on shoring up its domestic infrastructures more than international infrastructures, and partially due to the weakness in international economies.All told, gross billings increased 4% to $1.4 billion. Revenue increased 8% to $601 million. Operating income was $51 million, a decline of $16 million YoY, but $37 million more than last quarter. EPS was .03 per share, and GAAP EPS was -.01 per share.Stock MetricsGroupon is still quite a ways from being healthy, but it appears to have turned the corner on its way to a stronger business model.The company currently has a forward P/E ratio of 29.23, but when a company is undergoing the business model changes that Groupon is, earnings can fluctuate significantly. Analysts are now expecting almost 25% yearly EPS growth over the next 5 years, so they expect the new business model to start paying off.Additionally, the company has zero debt, and over $1.1 billion dollars in cash, so it has room to either save the cash for a few more quarters of struggles or make a strategic acquisition.The stock price seems to have be overextended due to the recent run, but maybe its current price is fair value. Deutsche Bank recently raised its price target to $10 on the stock. And Morgan Stanley recently raised their fair value on the stock to $9, citing a solid domestic business and its new business model that gets away from email deals.RisksThe risks that Groupon faces are multiple. While it is excellent that it has a customer base of over 40 million people, it is easy to create a ""daily deal"" website. This is why it is important that it switch to the new business plan and focus on mobile.Also, competitors like Living Social (which is backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) all have huge war chests and will provide stiff competition going forward. The risk here is that Groupon can't distinguish itself from these behemoth competitors.ChartYou can see in the chart above that the stock price broke out above the top of the channel. This is a bullish move and could signal even stronger buying. This is the type of pattern that could portend a quick run higher before possibly taking a breather and selling off a little.The PlayIt seems that investors have awakened to the fact that the new business model may help provide the promise that this company exhibited prior to its IPO. Smart investors that get in for a good price should reap the benefits. However, it remains to be seen if the stock has come too far, too fast.Because of the recent chart action, I think that there may be a period of stock price increases and I think that for shorter-term traders, there may be a chance to ride the wave while keeping a tight stop.For longer-term investors, I would be less inclined to buy at this point. If I ""had"" to because I wasn't sure that we would get back to sub-$8, I would consider buying a fraction of my normal position size. So for example, instead of buying $5000 worth of stock, maybe look to buy $2500 now and the rest on a pullback. If there is no pullback, you would at least have a position on to catch the move upwards.Another method is to lower your cost basis by selling calls (and even puts) against the position. This can have the effect of tremendously lowering your initial cost in the long run. If you aren't familiar with this strategy, check this out.Another option would be to imply buy some July $9 calls for .20 ($20) each. There was a 34% chance of that option expiring in the money at the time of this writing, so that is a spec play and should warrant a much smaller position size. However, if the breakout above the channel does signal a period of rapid price increases, these calls could provide a significant return. The key is to realize this trade could end worthless or triple the investment, so its best to limit its size.Disclaimer: We do not know your personal financial situation, so the information contained in this article represents an opinion, and should not be construed as personalized investment advice.

1291251,45691,2013-03-21T04:44:01-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported Q4 and FY 2012 results on Wednesday, Feb. 27. This news did not delight investors, as the company's stock plunged about 28% following the announcement. Groupon's daily deals business posted improved results, but this still wasn't enough to trigger an upswing in the company's profits. A few weeks later, the departure of the company's CEO was announced thrusting the company into a state of dilemma. Questions are being asked whether the company could do better without Andrew Mason as CEO.Groupon's Q4 and FY12 results came short of expectations and consequently meant the end of an era for MasonGroupon operates as a local commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers, offering goods and services at a discount in North America and internationally.According to its earnings statement, Groupon reported billings of $1.52 billion, significantly above the Street estimate of $1.33 billion. But revenue of $638 million merely matched consensus estimates. This was attributed to the company's strategy to accept lower take rates in order to attract higher-quality merchants. Take rate was down 469 basis points from the previous quarter. However, according to a note to investors from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee, the company's take rates are expected to stabilize and improve in the coming quarters.Mobile accounted for 40% of the company's overall revenue, up from 33% in the previous quarter. Groupon's ""search"" marketplace has taken off with giant strides, with 50% of local transaction volume already attributable to it; this marketplace now boasts 37,000 active deals, up 300% year over year. Could this be the daily deals company's last throw of the dice? If so, then things look promising, ceteris paribus.However, one of the major reasons why despite the increase in revenues the company's profits performed dismally is the Operating expense, which grew as the company invested in merchant quality and new initiatives. However, marketing costs were well-managed, declining by 15% from the September quarter, and 61% year over year. Overall operating profits (non-GAAP) came in at $14 million, far from the Street estimate of $40 million.The thin line between life and deathGroupon sends daily emails to its subscribers regarding discounted offers for goods and services that are targeted by location and personal preferences. Consumers also access its deals directly through the company's Website and mobile applications. This line of business puts Groupon in direct competition with industry giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Sadly for Groupon, those two hold a huge advantage against it.Groupon offers links to discounted products and services, which is perceived to be one of its strengths. But Google has already come up with new methods to drive users to various products according to their search terms. It is no longer about Google AdWords, but Product Listing Ads (PLAs). Whenever a user enters a search query relevant to an item in a Google merchant center account, Google will automatically show the most relevant products along with the associated image, price and product name. This would without a doubt tramp Groupon's advances to a turnaround if its alternatives continue to diminish.Merchants are also expressing high level of adoption of PLAs. According to Google's Q4 earnings results, during the fourth quarter of 2012, PLA budget investments increased by a whopping 600 percent to 2.5 percent from 0.36 percent in October. Over the 12-month period, they increased by 210 percent, from a paltry 2.1 percent in January to 6.6 percent in December.Facebook will be challenging Groupon with its Ad exchange dubbed FBX. It will also provide another headwind for Groupon with its Sponsored stories, an investment that is beginning to pay-off generously. Facebook also boasts a massive user base, which means that Merchants have a larger pool to fish.The social networking giant's sponsored stories unit was already generating an estimated $1 million per day, by July 2012. The company also introduced promoted posts and a gift service to boost its ecommerce business. However, it is FBX, which stands to down Groupon to the floor if all goes well.Facebook is using its users' data to great advantage. The company has access to a lot of information related to its more than one billion monthly users. It is using this to target Ads to its members whenever they browse the internet, whether via mobile application, or web, and regardless of their login status.The Bottom LineSterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia is of the opinion that Groupon could be troughing in the next three to four quarters, signifying a successful turnaround. The analyst expects the company to improve on its take-rates, and operating expenses. That said, Groupon is showing no signs of sustainable growth in revenues. The analyst just cut his estimates for the next two years, which indicates that Groupon could actually see a decline in revenues going forward.The analyst now expects the company to report $2.9 billion in FY13 down from $3.3 billion, while the expectation for 2014 is $2.5 billion from the initial $2.9 billion. He noted that the company's stock would be a good buy for investors willing to play around with its turnaround, but on a long-term perspective.For me, this sounds more like ""buy it at your own risk"", as taking risks is what surmounts to returns. However, now that Mason is out, there is likely to be some good rapport between the management and the board. This would also be a good thing for the company's ordinary shareholders, as an end to boardroom wars could set a new beginning.There is a lot of opportunity in the company's business, the downside being high competition. Nonetheless, it's the competition that brings the best out of a company, and of course the worst, and Groupon would be categorized in one of the two in the next few years. If you must own this stock, then you also need to think long-term, as the road to recovery is long and rough.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1265151,43841,2013-03-12T06:17:02-04:00,,"Shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) traded down on Monday morning, coming off seven highly volatile trading days that saw the stock sink 24% following a poor earnings report and then gain back most of that loss in just a few days after the departure of CEO Andrew Mason. With Mason gone, is the stock ready to continue its run? Or, will it languish at these or lower levels for a while until the dust settles?There are lots of questions here - uncertainty might be the most prevalent fear at GRPN right now - and as an investor, questions about a company's future and its leadership worry me.Where's the Upside?Investors who are bullish on shares of GRPN are not buying into the stock because of its strong fundamentals, great balance sheet, or history of strong earnings. Quite to the contrary, they're building positions around the potential for a turnaround. GRPN has been beaten down pretty badly during its time as a public company. Since the company's IPO in November 2011, the company has shed nearly 73% of its value. Bullish investors are betting that shares have found a bottom and will rebound from here. The departure of Mason, whose tenure was marked with turmoil and disillusionment, sparked the recovery from the stock's post-earnings drop with hopes that a new leadership team will be able to rebuild the company from its current humble position.Who Will Lead?The search is underway for Mason's replacement, but it won't be an easy road to find the next CEO of GRPN. The Board, led by Eric Lefkofsky and Ted Leonsis, has already decided that they'll focus their efforts on recruiting an external candidate to lead the company. After Mason's departure, many insiders speculated that next in line to run the company was Chief Operating Officer Kal Raman, who had previously worked for competitor and industry-leader Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Analysts believed that Raman was the best internal candidate, but the outside search implies that he won't get the top spot. GRPN is looking for change - somebody with an outside perspective to lead the company towards profitability.The Trouble with the SearchLefkofsky is GRPN's executive chairman and co-founder, and he'll be the biggest hand in the pot once a new CEO comes on board. There are worries on the street that Lefkofsky's presence at the company will make for an uncomfortable transition for any incoming CEO, and that after a short period at the helm, the new recruit might want to call it quits. When Mason and Lefkofsky ran the company the dynamics were long-standing - as CEO, Mason was more operational while Lefkofsky focused more on oversight. Clearly, that leadership tandem didn't pan out, as noted with continued loss and Mason's firing. There will have to be a cultural shift at the top of this company in order for any change to actually take place.How About the Stock?As noted, shares of GRPN surged following the announcement that Mason would no longer be serving as CEO. They stretched nearly back to the highs the stock was making pre-earnings, when the street was becoming increasingly bullish on a quarterly earnings beat. Unfortunately, the earnings were a huge miss. The company reported a Q4 loss of $.12 and a FY 2012 loss of $.10 on lower than anticipated revenues. Additionally, their forward guidance for Q1 2013 was a much larger range than analysts had predicted. The overall picture was dim and it got even dimmer with earnings. The turnaround that was seemingly in place got put on hold. The tenure of Mason does not fully account for the negative direction of the stock. His departure, while good news for the company and for the underlying stock, does not signal the complete turnaround that the price of the shares have indicated. The divergence here, and the fact that the CEO search will take longer than anticipated given Lefkofsky's hand in the matter, is the reason why shares of GRPN will languish here. Until the near-term dust clears (new CEO appointed, Q1 results come in at the high end of the wide guided range), GRPN is a $5 stock.Disclosure: I am short GRPN.

1244341,44911,2013-03-04T12:41:00-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) was founded less than five years ago, in November, 2008, and has managed to gain the attention of many on Wall Street. Due to being the first company in the ""daily deals"" space and its once steadily growing sales, Google (GOOG) offered Groupon $6 billion for the company in 2010. Of course the board of Groupon turned the offer down, and as of Friday February 28th, 2013 the market cap of GRPN sits at $3.36 billion.Not long after Google's offer was rejected, they started their own daily deals division, Google Offers. This highlights the first problem with the Internet coupon industry: very low barriers to entry. All you really need are salesmen and businesses willing to participate. That is why so many of these online coupon companies have popped up over the last few years including Yelp Deals (NYSE:YELP) and Living Social.This influx of companies operating in the space is another problem. The laws of supply and demand would dictate the more companies offering this kind of service to business owners the lower the price of the service (since the number of potential customers hasn't increased at the same pace as entrants into the industry). That is one reason the margins have dropped, and why Groupon can't turn a profit.So why are some people touting Groupon as a potential turnaround candidate? Many believe the recent firing of co-founder and ex-CEO Andrew Mason will be a good catalyst for change at the company. Others saw the rise in revenue last quarter as positive, even though profits slipped further into the red. A 5-year old company that had a huge IPO (the second biggest tech IPO after Google) being called a turnaround candidate should raise some alarms that maybe the excitement over Groupon was misplaced.Let's assume that the new leadership at Groupon manages to turn a profit, or at least lose less money, and they can outlive some of the smaller players like Living Social. They will still have to compete with Yelp and Google's coupon offerings, whom I believe will end up eating Groupon's lunch.Yelp and Google both have other business lines that complement a daily coupon offer. When people use Yelp to find reviews on that new sushi place down the street, it makes a lot of sense to offer a coupon for either that restaurant or a nearby sushi place. Since the coupon is relevant to something they are actively searching for, I would think that increases the chances of the consumer buying a coupon.And more or less the same goes for Google Offers. People use Google to actively search for something. The information that Google can collect through your searches, theoretically, should help them be able to find deals that are more pertinent to the consumer. My experience with Google Offers doesn't necessarily jive with this theory, but obviously Google has much more information on us than Groupon, so if they can't figure out what you want to buy, how would Groupon?The bottom line is that both Yelp and Google have much more information than Groupon, that they can use to their advantage when presenting coupons to customers. This allows them to target consumers that are actively searching for something, rather than passively sending out coupons that match an area of interest, or as is common that just matches where you live.On top of the information gap, there's the challenge that most businesses which would participate in an Internet coupon already have relationships with Yelp and Google on some level or another. This familiarity should lead to more success in convincing businesses to participate in a coupon offer.Groupon made the Internet coupon industry, so give them credit for that. But can they ever make money in the space they created? It's possible Groupon could turn around, but with low barriers to entry and larger, more relevant rivals, it's more likely that Groupon won't exist in 10 years (and that's being generous). I only wish I could have shorted shares in the first month of trading, when GRPN was closer to $30 a share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1245681,28131,2013-03-04T18:00:43-05:00,,"I owned and liked Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) based on its growth rates and cash flow. The growth and cash flow are now both gone and I have sold my position based on the latest earnings report. The euphoria of CEO Andrew Mason's departure is a good time to fold my cards. The future is uncertain and there are better places to put my money.Groupon is fundamentally a different company than one year ago. From a daily deals company focusing on services and local merchants it is transitioning to a goods liquidator. With all the hype in its press release about Q4 2012 results - 24% increase in gross billings and 30% increase in gross revenues year/year, it is hard to tell what is really going on with Groupon. Let's look at this excerpt from the Statement of Operations:Note that third party revenue has declined somewhat and direct revenue is galloping. I am willing to give a growth business some slack on net income since it may be investing for growth. But higher revenues should still lead to a higher gross profit if the business was fundamentally sound. However, even without looking at its expenses we see that despite the revenue growth in both 3rd party and direct revenue yr/yr total Gross Profit actually declined from Q4 2011. Once we take all the noise out about problems in Europe and the focus on gross billings and persistent deals - Groupon is a declining business barely one year after its IPO.In Q4 2011, the quarter the company went public it had $492 million in revenue at a Gross Profit of $395 million. Now it has shifted revenue to direct revenue and increased its revenue by Q4 2012. A year later, its Gross Profit is now only $355 million. This means it is losing profitability in its non-goods daily deals business faster than it is adding profit in its direct revenue business. The Groupon model, based on merchant funded cash flows and high gross margins, is not working.It is quite possible that the stock may rally from here and Groupon may find a business model that works but at this point I would rather sit out and wait. As I pointed out here, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is showing the exact opposite trends where its business model is accelerating. It's a better opportunity for my money.Disclosure: I am long FB.

1248511,24674,2013-03-05T14:53:48-05:00,,"Last week, Andrew Mason was fired. This did not come as a surprise even to his most ardent supporters. Accounting scandals and plummeting share price notwithstanding, there were plenty of reasons to lose faith in Mr. Mason. His tenure as CEO of Groupon (GRPN) can be summarized by the statement, he never acted like a CEO. He went out of his way to be quirky, goofy and eccentric. He wanted to sell an image of himself as the outlier genius who built global enterprise while bucking conventional wisdom. If you paid attention to Mr. Mason and Groupon, you know what I'm talking about. But what is impressive is that he nearly succeeded with his ambition. He built a multi-billion dollar global company by revolutionizing the world's second oldest profession - retail.The story of Groupon very closely mirrors the early history of Amazon (AMZN). Amazon also revolutionized retail by bringing it online. And like Groupon, Amazon had a tremendous amount of growing pains. Early on, Amazon had almost refused to make a profit instead opting for growth. Jeff Bezos saw that the web was the future. Even as Bill Gates had declared the Internet as a ""fad"", Jeff Bezos poured everything he and Amazon had into building one of the most formidable retail operations ever. As a result, Amazon reported losses quarter after quarter and year after year. In fact, many wondered if Amazon was capable of being profitable. Common arguments against Amazon included that its margins were too small; it had too big of an operation; Mr. Bezos had no experience in managing a large organization, and so on. These are the same arguments that were made against Mr. Mason and Groupon.Worse yet for Amazon, many new competitors entered its territory. Everyone from BN.com (NYSE:BKS) to Wal-Mart (WMT) wanted a piece of Amazon's market. Amazon's future seemed bleak. The stock price dipped below $6. Investors, pundits, and analysts lost faith. It was widely believed that Amazon would never be profitable; therefore, it was a short. However, Mr. Bezos understood that capturing the market and building sticky relationships with both his customers and producers would ultimately be the difference between success and obsolescence. Growth mattered above everything else. And he was right. Nearly 20 years later, Amazon is now one of the most successful and powerful companies in the world. In fact, the only two things that Wal-Mart's CEO loses sleep over are unions and Amazon.com. And Barnes and Noble seems on track for the same fate as Borders book stores. What is also extraordinary is that Jeff Bezos achieved this vision without much fanfare. Jeff Bezos may be the smartest guy in business whose voice you've never heard.Now onto Groupon. Other than differences in their respective CEO's egos, what I just said about Amazon's early history can also be said about Groupon. Unfortunately, that is where the similarities may end. Although I believe Groupon was also on its way to global success, it may no longer have the chance to because the Goupon Board fired the guy with the vision.Despite the challenges, Groupon was capturing its market. It expanded its operation to sell goods and services all over the world. It created a payment system that would improve loyalty among its small business customers. It is aggressive in the way that it finds and builds relationships. Ironically, business wasn't that bad either and outlook was fairly bright. Although Groupon did report losses and a declining growth rate, its growth rate remains at nearly 30%. This was despite continued slowing in Europe as a result of an endless recession. Moreover, daily deals or group buying as a category still has room to grow. Less than half of consumers are aware of this kind of shopping experience. It saves consumer money and clears the shelves for retailers. It is a win-win for everyone involved and Groupon was on its way to perfecting this model. More importantly, it was doing all of this better than its competitors, including LivingSocial which as you may know is a subsidiary of Amazon. In other words, Andrew Mason was beating Jeff Bezos. Unfortunately unlike Amazon, Groupon started in the wrong era.Amazon was founded in the mid 1990s. It started and went through it growing pains during an era when profitability was no longer a tool for valuing companies. Instead, we had things like eyeball traffic, time spent on website, and page views as the new measures of value. Even though it was not profitable, Amazon did well in all of these measures. So, people threw money at it. Its share price went through the roof even as it was hemorrhaging money. More importantly, investors during this era wanted companies to capture the market, keep competitors at bay, and grow at any cost. It was not until 1999 and the tech bubble burst that investors began demanding profitability. Until then, investors were patient and willing to accept losses as long as the company was growing. Had Groupon started during this period, Mr. Mason may still be the CEO. Groupon would have been given enough time to grow, develop, and generate consistent profits. Unfortunately, the 90s are dead, and Groupon started a decade and half too late. Groupon investors chose profitability over growth.Worse yet, Groupon may not have anyone who can step in and lead the company to some kind of resurrection. Groupon was Mr. Mason's vision. It isn't a mature company that needs a caretaker CEO. It is a growing company that needs a visionary, and how often do you find those? I believe they fired Mr. Mason too soon. I believe it was shortsighted. I believe the Groupon Board could have imposed some discipline on Mr. Mason like forcing him to close his Twitter account, staying away from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and demanded that he keep his mouth shut and office door closed. But they did not do any of that. They responded to pressure and had a very short view. Groupon needed patience to grow into something special. Unfortunately, we may not have that patience. That is why I went from being a Groupon believer to being highly doubtful of its future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1242821,24776,2013-03-04T04:21:48-05:00,,"Investors are clearly happy after Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock jumped nearly 13% after the board fired CEO Andrew Mason. Mason has been under pressure due to poor earnings and a falling stock price. Since its IPO, Groupon's stock is down more than 82%. Not quite the return shareholders were expecting.So with Mason out, the market seems to believe Groupon has a fighting chance given the sharp rise up after the announcement. However, I honestly don't believe his firing changes anything. Groupon's business model is the problem, not Mason.Groupon fails because the small businesses offering the discounts end up losing money. Not only will a business have to offer a steep discount for a product or service, but will also have to pay a high commission structure to Groupon, just for listing the deal.The theory behind small businesses doing this is even though they would lose money on the coupons, they believe they can attract long-term customers. Unfortunately, this theory is wrong. The businesses find customer volume falls off after the deals are done and they are not much better off than before they offered the coupon.Business owners have no incentive to list deals through Groupon. In fact, it would end up hurting the business by doing so. So why would a business owner renew a deal on Groupon?The company's problem is not related to who is CEO, but is about the business model. In fact, the next CEO will run into the same issues that Mason had. Unless the new CEO can change the entire business model, it's very unlikely much can be done to turn the company around.Even with Mason gone, investors should just stay away. This is a company which should have never gone public to begin with. Eventually the volume of coupons will drastically fall and no matter how big Groupon's sales force is, it won't be able to stop the bleeding when the coupon issuers do not benefit. Groupon's best option is to adapt to a stronger business model and not just focus on management change.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1241911,41751,2013-03-02T20:22:45-05:00,,"After this past Wednesday's poor Q4 earnings report and underwhelming guidance for FY2013, Groupon Inc (NASDAQ: GRPN) Thursday announced the firing of CEO Andrew Mason, who will be replaced by Executive Chairman Eric Lefkofsky and Vice Chairman Ted Leonsis. The two will share CEO duties on an interim basis while the board searches for a replacement.While most investors would agree that it was time for Andrew Mason to leave, the absence of a clear successor is just another uncertainty for the company. Indeed, the board had considered replacing Mason as early as this past November, and by all accounts had placed him on their version of ""double secret probation"". Which begs the question: Why does the board seem unprepared at this juncture with no clear replacement in mind?Not that it really matters. Any new CEO will face the same challenges of a company struggling to remain relevant in the face of stronger competition from both innovative startups with local merchant relationships, as well as internet behemoths like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Still, management's Q1 2013 guidance for revenue of $560 - $610 million and operating income of $(10) - $10 million, which was well below consensus estimates, is perhaps a bit overdone. In fact, in the company's short history it has developed a record of guiding low and then beating those estimates.To be sure, there were some encouraging numbers in the quarterly release. Gross Billings of $1.5 billion (+25% quarter over quarter, and +24% Year over Year) were the highest increase since the company went public in November of 2011. At the same time, there were declines in marketing costs of -14% Q/Q and -61% Y/Y. The North American customer base grew 8% Q/Q and 22% Y/Y. So, it would seem that the strategy of transitioning to higher quality merchants is beginning to see some traction.Where does Groupon Go From Here?The first thing that any new CEO should do is perform a simple SWOT Analysis. To help that newly minted CEO hit the ground running I have completed one here:Strengths:· Groupon has a large customer base with primarily local merchants· The company has excellent data analytics which gives it an advantage in targeting deals· The company employs a very flat hierarchy with most employees dedicated to the sourcing and implementing of daily deals at the customer levelWeaknesses:· Subscribers are fickle and will move on if new and high quality deals are not constantly offered.· Payment terms to merchants are not as favorable as other sites.· History of poor customer serviceOpportunities:· Leverage merchant loyalty through better payment terms and programs· Expand deals beyond just merchandise and travel· Expand and develop a customer loyalty programThreats:· Low barrier to entry for other daily deal startups· Google/Amazon· Everyday lower pricingWhat Do Investors Do Now?After a strong bounce on Friday, the stock is currently trading at just over $5/share. Share price may remain weak for some time as financial metrics are not likely to improve near term. Indeed the company has said that it is focused on growth over near term profitability.Based on the company's guidance, I would estimate EBITDA of $390 million. Using a 5x multiple provides a reasonable $4.50 price to the stock. Of course if the company issues missed quarterly numbers or lowers its guidance the stock could trade as low as $2 - slightly above its current cash balance. On the upside, if the board can quickly find a competent CEO who can execute on company initiatives and re-accelerate revenue growth, the shares could rebound to as much as $7-$8/share.The bottom line is that this is not a company I'd be willing to invest in until it can prove that it can successfully manage through this transition.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Aren't margins suppose to be in tandem with revenue? Yes if the business model was the same, but it is changing.Please look at the chart below:Third party revenue that makes up the original business of the company is actually doing lousy. Not only was third party revenue down in Q4 on a y-o-y basis ($413 million in Q4 2012 vs. $475 million in Q4 2011), but it was also down sequentially q-o-q. For Q3 of 2012 the company recorded third party revenue of $423 million and direct revenue of 144 million.On the other hand, we see direct revenue becoming an ever increasing part of the company's sales mix. In fact, while for all of 2011 direct sales were miniscule - about $20 million with total sales of $1.58 billion - in 2012 direct revenue was $454 million with total sales of $1.88 billion. In other words, on a yearly basis, direct sales were about 29% of total sales. But look what is happening in Q4, direct sales comprise 35% of total sales.So what's the problem with direct sales? Well there is no profit to be made. In the chart above, direct revenue for the current quarter was $225 million, but the cost of direct revenue was $218.5 million. In other words, the company made a mere $6.5 million in profit.The decline in the company's core business is probably a product of fierce competition in the coupon space. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers and Yelp Deals (NYSE:YELP) - as well as the many other national platforms - are taking business from the company and it can't do anything about it.As I see it, in the face of brutal competition the company is trying to make up for the lost high margin coupon revenue by doing more direct deals. But this to me looks a lot more like wholesale activity than anything else.And I would not really have a problem with this, if the company only managed to make money. Also, if I wanted to buy a wholesale stock, I wouldn't be buying a coupon stock.In my last take on the company I said the following:Bottom line:I am not sure anymore about the long term prospects of this company as I was several months ago. To be honest, I underestimated how fast direct sales would rise and how negatively they would impact gross profits.I think the possibility that Google might buy Groupon is now totally out of the picture, and we can not count on this as a wild card anymore.I still think this stock is a sell at current levels, until we get a better sense of future earnings. Furthermore, we need to get a better understanding on how the company's model is evolving and its future impact, because it is obvious that many things in the company's model are changing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Not surprisingly, Groupon stock is already up 10% in after hours trading, signaling that the market thinks this is going to be a great move for the company long-term. Groupon is coming off of a significant earnings miss and is trading at roughly 25% of its IPO price; needless to say, things have been in a tailspin for Groupon longs.(Click to enlarge)Groupon's PR commented:CNBC broke the story yesterday afternoon and provided the world with a copy of Mason's letter to his employees. Hands down, Mason's e-mail is one of the most petty and unprofessional addresses I've read from a corporate professional.People often point out that Mason only took an $800/year salary, but let's not forget the $10 million in stock he cashed out in 2011 before the company's stock took a nosedive. I don't think there's a more out-of-touch thing you could say to a Groupon shareholder who's put their life savings into the company at $30/share than ""Don't worry about Andrew Mason, he's going to be just fine. He doesn't want you to worry about him"".Now, to his credit he does take accountability for the trouble the company has had. He nails it head on when he says:Taking accountability is not to be overlooked, but it's shadowed over by the rest of the content of his e-mail.I'm Now Bullish On GrouponHere's three reasons aside from the momentum behind Mason's ousting to go long Groupon right now.1. Analysts Still Digging ItFrom the CNBC article:2. Chart Indicates A Potential Run ComingLet's examine a shorter term chart:(Click to enlarge)From a technical standpoint, sans the drop from earnings (and the ensuing mini-rally from Mason's departure), the stock has been in an uptrend since mid-November. The RSI is heading into oversold territory today and, on the heels of the pounding Groupon took from earnings, savvy investors might be able to buy in at a discount tomorrow morning on open. Shorts that were hoping for an earnings disaster got their wish, but may also be forced into covering tomorrow as the stock starts to gravitate upwards on the ""good"" news.3. Expected GrowthEquity Watch did a fantastic article on Groupon yesterday after earnings. They point out the expected EPS growth for the company going forward and note a couple of other metrics that fell on deaf ears as they ran alongside the bad news:ConclusionCEOs like Mason can be a jackpot or a cancer for companies. The harsh reality is that the creative genius behind an innovative product or company is sometimes hardly the person to run the company. Visionaries are visionaries for a reason -- they see things and do things in completely different ways than the rest of us. This is can be extremely beneficial when trying to come up with product innovation or creative solutions, but can also be extremely harmful when these people are put into a situation where they have real accountability and shareholders to be accountable to. Mason's e-mail only goes to show how seriously he took his responsibility to shareholders.This is Groupon's mulligan -- its second chance. It's going to be up to the new executive committee to get this company up, running and humming, and they're not going to have a long time to show results. Since they've both been chairpersons to begin with, they're familiar with the company and likely already know what has to be done (my guess is they've been making suggestions that have been disregarded by Mason for a while now).With the IPO price being insanely overvalued, this is now your chance to truly get in on the ground floor with Groupon stock, and for that reason, I'm bullish going forward here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

1240821,24276,2013-03-01T15:05:12-05:00,,"The real lesson of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is something that has been true since the Web was spun. People don't scale. Not like computers they don't.The way to success in business is always through automation, doing more with fewer hands. We automated agriculture, we automated manufacturing, and when those gains became insufficient we automated the work of men's minds.That's what the whole computer revolution is all about. That's what the Web was about. The Yahoo (YHOO) directory didn't scale as well as a search engine could. No collection of web pages could scale the way Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its programming could. John Henry keeps fighting the automated nail driver, and he keeps losing.Andrew Mason defied this. Since his idea was new -- deliver offers that would only become real after a certain number of people accepted them -- he had early success. But you still need people to sell merchants on the idea, and people to write up the offers.By automating this process, by making it all self-service, it was obvious from the beginning that Groupon could be beaten. What's amazing is that it took so long, and that Mason never reacted to what would be a natural change in the market. Mason's firing was overdue.The question is whether there is any value left in the shares, at all. Even at its current reduced price, shareholders are still paying $6 for each $1 GRPN generates. That's still close to the level of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and on par with what Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) shareholders are paying, and I'd say that both Google's and Facebook's prospects are much better.By contrast, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is selling at closer to three times its sales, and the ratio at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is even lower. Even if you believe in the model that says making the whole thing self-service can generate additional revenue, I can't see paying more for Groupon's sales than those of Microsoft or Apple. Are their growth prospects really better?So this remains a short. It will, at some point, become a bargain for someone. I don't know who, I don't know when, but at some point the name and the volume and the turnaround prospects will become irresistible to someone.Disclosure: I am long GOOG, YHOO.

1238711,44731,2013-03-01T08:35:21-05:00,,"Sticking to my mold of contrarian trading I couldn't help but notice the sea of red surrounding Groupon shares (NASDAQ:GRPN) following yet another disappointing quarter. As it was trading down almost 24% for the day, I started digging for opportunity.Dissecting what was said in the report was easy. Substantial revenue growth, almost 30% year-over-year, followed by substantial earnings disappointment $-0.12 per share versus $-0.02 per share a year ago. The street was not happy with this and did what the street has done so often with Groupon: Handed it a nice kick in the mouth.Now it can be easy to demand fast and substantial results from a publicly-traded company. However what people fail to remember is that Groupon is essentially a start-up and to grow a start-up it takes money to make money, i.e. capital expenses should go up as you are initially growing and capturing more market share. Eventually existing customers become the biggest segment of your business growth and the portion of revenue used to grow your business non-organically goes down.With a company like Groupon, which is trading with a market cap just barely above one year's current revenue, and a multi-billion dollar footprint, it's easy to understand why almost 15.5% of the total shares outstanding traded hands yesterday and there was still strong support for that 103 million shares between $4.50 and $4.80. It was only a little over a year ago when the good people of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered $5.75-$6 billion dollars to buy the company. A time when Groupon had less users and less revenue than it has today. That offer was pre-IPO but it placed an equivalent value on Groupon of around $9.15 per share. It was also reported that potentially the company would have sold for a number between $7.5 billion and $8 billion dollars. Let's go with the lower and assume that means a number of potentially $11.44 per share. I can't say for sure that selling the company is still a consideration for the board of Groupon but let's assume it was to entertain an offer. I would surmise it would be one closer to the number or exceeding that of the one it might have taken back in 2011.In addition, after the market closed yesterday, current CEO Andrew Mason was fired by the Board of Directors. A move Wall Street seemed to like as Groupon recovered around 7% in after-hours trading.The technical side of things looked very good for Groupon on the massive volume that traded hands yesterday. There was good support for the stock between $4.50 and $4.80. Institutional ownership is at 58% currently and Groupon, as it sits today, is a big traders' stock. So I would expect a lot of action in the security going forward over the next week.All-in-all, I think Groupon has a sustainable business. I think revenue continues to grow for as long as it provides value to the consumer. I think the right person at the top can get costs in line with expectations and or exceed them and I would not be at all surprised to see another offer to buy out the brand. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is attempting to grow in the space, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) could make a good fit and I'm sure the people at Google have not forgotten the value they placed on Groupon's highly valuable consumer database. I think any of the three could make a great marriage to Groupon and quickly turn their talent, expertise and resources into a profit with Groupon's model and consumers. Now that egos may have been checked, it seems like the possibility for a mutually beneficial deal still exists.However, even if that day never comes, Groupon clearly knows how to generate revenue, if it gets costs in line and keeps the consumer coming back for more, it will thrive in the coming years.Therefore it's my belief that Groupon is the deal we are getting half off on and should take full advantage while it's still on the table.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

1233031,33311,2013-02-28T10:00:40-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported Q4 earnings after the bell yesterday and the market dumped the stock after hours. The stock closed the after-hours session 25% lower than the regular session, largely because of a weaker-than-expected Q1 forecast for revenues. I'm going to review the quarterly report and assess whether or not the stock is a buy.Gross billings increased from $1.23 billion to $1.52 billion. Revenue increased from $492 million to $638 million. International revenue actually dropped from $312 million to $263 million, while North American revenue more than doubled from $179 million to $375 million. Segment operating income decreased from $17.9 million to $13.7 million.Net operating loss was reduced from $14.9 million to $12.8 million. Excluding stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, operating profit came in at $14 million in Q4. On the surface, these numbers are pretty much in line with what analysts had expected: $638 million and adjusted EPS of $0.02 (EPS was -$0.12 but included one time expenses, which, if excluded, would bring EPS in line with estimates).So why are investors hating the stock? Easy -- guidance was weak. With expected revenue between $560 million and $610 million in Q1, revenues are well short of expectations of $650 million. This is in part blamed by the fact that Groupon Goods is more of a seasonal business and, as such, Q4 is expected to be the best quarter of the year.The other disappointment was the drop in local deals revenue from $479 million to $413 million. It appears that this was most likely due to the company's decision to reduce its take on local deals to help ""drive growth by attracting more top merchants to Groupon. While we believe marketing will always be an effective growth lever for us, our results show that it is not the only way to accelerate top line. By lowering deal margins, we created more value for our merchants, which enabled us to improve our merchant and deal quality. These actions not only drove demand and improved the customer experience, but also helped us make some of our largest ever sequential gains in the  North America segment market share in Q4,"" as per CEO Andrew Mason.Additionally, international revenues were a disappointment. The company's COO Kal Raman signaled that there would be big layoffs in the international division to help get that division operating as efficiently as the North American division. This could potentially be a big driver of profitability growth as the company automates and rightsizes this division.In looking at the growth of Groupon Goods and other initiatives including Groupon Payments and Groupon Breadcrumb, which offers inventory management among other things, it's pretty clear that Groupon is moving more and more away from its initial growth driver of local deals into a platform much like the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) marketplace, tailored specifically for local businesses to do business with their customers. Now less than 50% of the transactions come from emails to its mailing list, which is 12% lower than Q3 2012. It seems as if the company is making the transition into a shopping marketplace, leveraging the power of its 40+ million email subscribers. This is what some people envisioned a couple of years ago as the local deals business was being called into question, and judging from the rapid growth in Groupon Goods, it seems like it is doing a good job of this.So the question now becomes whether or not the company can fully transition into what it views itself as: the operating system for local business. Again, as per Andrew Mason:The Breadcrumb iPad-based point of sale (POS) service for retail establishments has me intrigued. As an inventory management tool, it allows for easy uploading of menu items and inventory count to local businesses' iPad terminals, which should help businesses manage inventory better. It is being grouped together with Groupon Payments, which is an online payment service that offers very low fees to merchants accepting credit cards -- 1.8% for MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and Discover (NYSE:DFS), and 3% for American Express (NYSE:AXP). Ultimately the goal of the company is to create a platform where it is tied in with local businesses' operations, allowing them to lower transaction fees, manage inventory, and get rid of excess inventory faster than they otherwise would by tapping into Groupon's massive customer database.On Tuesday, e-commerce whisperer Mark Mahaney gave a presentation that focused on mobile and local trends. According to this article:I have to say that despite his many apparent faults, I have to give Mason the benefit of the doubt. He has managed to grow a business from $15 million in revenues in 2009 to a $2.5 billion run rate as of Q4 2012. And he has grown Groupon Goods from nothing to a near $1 billion run rate in two years. That is absolutely astonishing growth. While there are some definite flaws with this latest report, I can see a scenario in which Groupon can perfect its local business platform, pare down costs, and generate a good deal of free cash flow. At a 25% discount to yesterday's stock price and with about 40% of its market cap in cash, I think there are worse things to do than buy the latest deal on Groupon's stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in FB, ZNGA over the next 72 hours.

1238181,22675,2013-03-01T06:09:47-05:00,,"You won't be surprised to see that things are not going well for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). On Wednesday, the company announced its most recent earnings that featured-Losses of $81.1M (vs. $65.4 a year ago)-Gross Margin declining from 80.4% to 55.7%What part of the business is suffering? Basically all of it. The company once dominated its main market but is now trying to offer several different products in nearly 50 countries. Is it over its head? You bet. I've been one of many who believed that founder and CEO Andrew Mason wasn't the man to turn this around. From the moment Groupon turned public, things looked fishy with top execs selling loads of shares, many accounting irregularities, etc.Following the earnings, Groupon's stock tanked 24%.As a result, what many had been expecting happened as CEO Andrew Mason was fired the following day.Groupon Did Have Value OnceIt's easy to forget that Groupon was launched less than 5 years ago. After incredible growth in its first few years (Groupon had 35 million registered users after less than 2 years), it started to face major headwinds. Some were caused by its own fault (wasting money on a poor Super Bowl ad, some local missteps in Japan and elsewhere, etc) and others by huge competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (through its investment in Living Social), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and hundreds of smaller, more targeted players.Still, in November 2010, Google reportedly made an offer to buy the company for $6 billion, about twice Groupon's current value. That was $3B more than Yahoo had offered just a month prior. That seemed like a good decision a year later when Groupon turned public.What's Going Wrong?No doubt, a lot has gone wrong. Groupon has tried (and failed) to become this global ecommerce powerhouse offering dozens of different types of products on different platforms, falling short in many of those initiatives. As was said in this week's earnings call by Kal Raman, Groupon's COO:""We did grow way too fast with way too many people.""CEO Andrew Mason has not been impressive and not been convincing that he'll be able to turn things around. So I personally think that firing him was the right move.As is often the case in struggling tech companies, the costs are increasing much faster than revenues and earnings:In fact, almost any slide that you can look at in Groupon's recent presentation is worrying, just look at their full presentation.Groupon Does Have ValueYes, Groupon has lost most of its momentum, its mojo and clearly has made a lot of mistakes. That being said, it does have several elements going for it:- it is the leader in the space of daily deals.- it has the infrastructure and personal in dozens of countries to deal locally.- it has business relationships with thousands of companies (many would argue that a lot of those merchants ended up being unhappy about the results which is a fair point but many others did end up doing more business with Groupon).- it has 41 million active customers.Is It Worth A Flyer?In my opinion, the main thing missing for Groupon was a clear strategy. Knowing what it's good and not good at and focusing on those products/markets. Ousting Andrew Mason was the right move and while it could have been done earlier, I think there's still plenty of time for Groupon to recover. Groupon still has assets that are worth a lot to many of its larger competitors giving two possible positive outcomes for investors: either a turnaround or an acquisition.Personally, I will remain on the sidelines until we get a clear vision of who is stepping in and what the plan is. Yes, that might mean losing an opportunity but I just think that it will continue to be very volatile and they could very well go wrong. Just look at how many CEOs Yahoo hired until they got to Marissa Mayer which at least gives them a chance at a turnaround.Disclosure: I am long FB.

1242141,37511,2013-03-03T04:08:15-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) will miss the vision and quirkiness of Andrew Mason. He created the daily online deals industry by finding a simple solution to a complex problem of monetizing trial. In his departure letter addressed to Groupon Inc.'s employees whom he called Groupon People he said ""You deserve the outside world to give you a second chance. I'm getting in the way of that. A fresh CEO earns you that chance."" His personality did not fit the dictionary definition of a CEO and he had become a convenient distraction for his detractors. I hope he does not turn out to be the distraction that was needed but unfortunately misunderstood.If he is to be blamed for anything it would be that he never took the time to study the nuances of his business model before scaling it. Ultimately, the novelty factor dissipated and the cost of doing business with Groupon could not be justified for its business partners. It was always the business model, not the CEO, and I think they got rid of an excuse that never stopped giving. I argue that Groupon has performed very well within the constraints of its business model and the best the company can hope to get from a new CEO is better management of its operations.The Groupon Model:A Groupon is a coupon on steroids. They are both loss programs for merchants used to drive incremental sales, acquire and/or retain customers. With a coupon a merchant offers a discount off the sales price of a product or a service. The redemption rates and potential impact of coupons can only be accurately determined when a sales program is completed. With coupons, merchants bear the responsibility to set up a coupon program including administrative, marketing and pricing agreements. Customers who use coupons are responsible for everything in-between until they present the coupons at checkout.Groupon Inc. took the coupon concept and made it foolproof for merchants and customers. It guaranteed merchants a minimum amount of sales (group purchases), took care of marketing, took care of monetizing the coupons (Groupons) and provided some customer data to merchants in exchange for very steeply discounted prices for their services. For example, a service that would typically cost $100 would be negotiated down to a $50 price that is offered to customers. Groupon kept half of the $50, meaning that the merchants are effectively offering their products/services at a 75% discount.Instead of customers serendipitously finding coupons, Groupon Inc. structured the relationship and took happenstance out of it by sending deals to customers by email or through offers on their website. Customers could buy in advance and use at their convenience (digital or print) within a negotiated period. If Groupon Inc. was not able to sell a minimum amount, the deals were cancelled.The Limitations:The Groupon idea was always going to unravel in phases with the threat being that once the idea became mainstream, the fee structure would have to change.Phase 1:Phase II:Phase III:Performance:Groupons performance has mirrored the phases outlined above. It started out with excitement and peaked at a market value of about $13B. Through many teething issues including accounting issues and a workforce that grew from 30 to 10,000 in about two years, its current market value is $3.35B.The chart below shows a steady revenue growth which mirrored growth in its customer base and merchant partners. It also shows a steady growth in SG&A which turned out to be one of the sore points of Andrew Mason's tenure. Net income was always going to be a challenge as the company grew but continuous erosion of margins and an announcement of a change in the structure of deals with merchants at the last earnings call was the death stroke for Andrew Mason.The stock has behaved similarly, except that it declined continuously through the year. It is currently trading below its 200 day moving average with a return of -73.44% in the last year alone. Per the chart below there has been a lack of consistent momentum on the buy or sell side leading to fluctuations in the price. I sometimes consider purchasing a stock by looking at the gap between a stock price and 52 week high. If the gap is huge and the event that caused the gap is not justifiable in my estimation, I do further research to validate my intuition. In Groupon Inc.'s case, the high was $19.88 but there is clearly no inertia right now to suggest that the stock can gain enough momentum to rally out of the constraint zones - upward and downward. Plus, I don't see Groupon Inc. becoming better with its current business model going forward. There are few options to become more profitable including SG&A reductions and finding other ways to monetize the traffic to its website.Source: Yahoo FinanceConclusion:I initially titled this article - From Coupon to Groupon to Croupon - because I believe the business model was too simple for coupons not to catch up to it. Coupons eventually did and customers got bored with the daily emails of similar items 5 times a week. It was always going to be hard to maintain excitement with offerings dictated by what vendors were willing to offer. Andrew Mason could have done better but you could say that about a lot of entrepreneurs and business leaders.Groupon Inc. can only become a real company if it has some level of control of its destiny which today is in the hands of the merchants it partners with. When or if it decides to have more control of its fate, it will more than likely go the route of goods or getaways. This will put it in direct competition with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) amongst many other established companies.Andrew Mason may have made a lot of mistakes, but the most grievous of them is that Groupon Inc. grew too fast and destroyed a model that works better as a boutique rather than a mass retail model. Groupon got rid of an excuse, now it has nowhere else to hide.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1232391,43691,2013-02-28T04:39:34-05:00,,"In 2008, when the markets tumbled, many investors panicked and sold their assets hoping to redeem the remaining value of their assets, but the smart investors remained calm until the markets hit rock bottom and then bought in on the cheap goods. Likewise, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported Q4 FY2012 earnings on February 27 2013 and the dismal numbers caused investors to bail, but I have reasons for jumping into, not out, of Groupon.Groupon operates by negotiating with local and global businesses to offer low price deals for consumers on the premise that the large number of Groupon users who purchase these deals will offset the discount that the business allows. Also, Groupon owns Breadcrumb, a business that provides an electronic payment interface through Apple iOS iPad devices that allow for streamlined and easy payments for restaurants and drink businesses. Lastly, a less known tidbit about Groupon is that the company also operates a dating interface called Grouspawn that is completely free and allows couples who used a Groupon for their first date to apply for funding for their ""Grou-spawn,"" if they decide to produce one together. Currently, Groupon has over 10,000 employees and operates in 48 U.S. states and has offices in Chicago, Palo Alto, Latin America, Europe and Asia.Financials:Groupon reported $638.3 million in Q4 revenue and a loss of 12 cents per share, as compared to expectations of $640 million and a loss of only 2 cents per share. Analysts and investors were disappointed and reacted hysterically, causing shares to plunge over 26%. In the same quarter a year ago, the company reported $492 million and a loss of 6 cents per share. However, this was also the quarter with the highest gross billing of 1.52 billion. Gross billings refers to the dollar amount of the total groupons purchased by users. Furthermore, this quarter concluded the first fiscal year in which Groupon has generated a positive operating income of $99 million, as compared to ($67 million) in 2011. Q4 concluded a strong year, and the company is set to outperform in coming quarters.Some concerns that Investors have:Investors are concerned about Groupon's business internationally as 50.1% of the company's revenue is derived outside of North America. Q4 witnessed international revenue of $263 million, down $49.5 million from last year's Q4 international revenue. However, international revenues for 2012 totaled $1.1 billion, which is up from last year's $954 million, a 15% increase year-over-year.Furthermore, Groupon has made it a priority for 2013 to invest in facilities and technology to expand globally, and the expansion has already begun with the acquisition of 10 businesses for a total of $54.9 million. $46.9 million of that was paid in cash, and Groupon expects ""to continue to use cash to make strategic acquisitions."" With a current ratio of 1.3 and a 0 debt/equity ratio, you can expect Groupon to maintain a healthy balance sheet in the future even in the midst of aggressive capital expenditure.Also, analysts are concerned with the success of the Groupon Goods service that was initiated in 2011, and whether this could prove to be a source of growth for the company. Q4 saw $225.2 million in Goods revenue, up from $145 million in Q3 and $13.7 million in Q4 2011. However, the cost of Groupon Goods revenue was $218.6 million, so Groupon only received $6 million in profit. One of the reasons for this high cost of revenue was that in Q4 Groupon began to offer free shipping on Groupon Good orders greater than $15 dollars. To picture the benefit of Groupon Goods, let's take a look at year-over-year revenue growth. Total revenue for 2012 increased by $700 million year-over-year. Groupon Goods revenues alone increased by $433.9 million which equates to 62% of the revenue growth. As the infrastructure for Groupon Goods has been established in 2012 and Groupon has advertised Groupon Goods with the promotional deals, investors can expect Groupon Goods to further propel the company to new levels.Additionally, investors wonder if Groupon can keep up with the shift in momentum towards mobile devices. In January 2013, 40% of total transactions were done through mobile applications, up 44% from January 2012. This increase reflects the user friendliness of the Groupon mobile application and the high sense of security that customers feel when they initiate transactions through their handheld devices. In an era where mobile technology and integration will make or break a business's prosperity in the future, this successful integration of the mobile platform into its core business is a huge milestone for the company. Now, users can purchase Groupon deals at anytime and anywhere. If co-workers get together and decide they all want to go skydiving, the Groupon mobile application provides an easy venue for those consumers.Some further numbers to consider are that in 2012, Groupon had 41 million active customers, up 22% from 2011, and active deals in North America increased 300% to 37,000.Forward looking:Groupon expects $560 to $610 million in revenue for Q1 2013 and operating gains to be between (10 million) and 10 million. Although these estimates are lower than the previous quarter and have been lowered after the report, I would not be surprised if there is a positive surprise for the next quarter. Groupon has invested significantly in global operations and Groupon Goods is still catching on in certain niches - even here in the United States. Furthermore, the percentage of shorted shares as part of the float has decreased 13.10% since January, indicating momentum in investor sentiment for this stock.In Conclusion:With the current status of Groupon in terms of finances, business strategy, and global positioning, the company is poised to succeed in the future. Revenues and profit margins will continue to increase, and the company will grow not only nationally, but also globally, as it seeks to make up for the lack of international expansion this past quarter. I believe the market over-reacted to the earnings report this afternoon, and soon the market will correct for that hysteria.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The whisper number is $0.00, three cents behind the analysts' estimate. GRPN has a 50% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 1 of the 2 earnings reports for which we have data).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 1 qtrs- Met whisper: 0 qtrs- Missed whisper: 1 qtrsOur primary focus is on post earnings price movement. Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.Because GRPN only recently went public, historical information is (obviously) limited. We'll look at the two reports for which we have data.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:On August 13th, 2012, the company reported earnings two cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 22.9% loss in after hours trading, and added an additional 21.7% loss in just five trading days. Averages indicate strength for most companies that report earnings ahead of the whisper number expectation. GRPN certainly moved against the average outcome.Last quarter the company reported earnings three cents short of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 23.5% loss in after hours trading, and added an additional 12.3% loss in just three trading days. Overall GRPN appears to have a short term negative post earnings price reaction.On a more positive note, the stock (opening at $3.00 following the last earnings report on Nov. 8th) is now trading at a recent high of $5.55 ($5.63 in pre-market today) for an 85% gain in just three months.Enter your expectation and view more earnings information here, or let us know your expectation in the comments section below.**********************************Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings.

1233781,24408,2013-02-28T12:14:41-05:00,,"As the father of modern fundamental analysis, Columbia Professor Benjamin Graham outlined in the Securities Analysis (with David Dodd) and The Intelligent Investor, the valuation of a corporation begins with its intrinsic value: the value of the company as it is determined by the value of its asset, management, and prospects, most notably, the stream of earnings it is expected to generate-the source of cash flow, retained earnings, and dividends that enhance shareholder valueGraham emphasized that a company's intrinsic value may or may not be equal to its market value: the value Mr. Market -- to use their metaphor -- assigns to the company on a trading day, especially at times when Mr. Market decides with emotions rather than reason. A euphoric Mr. Market, for instance, may be valuing a company well above its intrinsic value, while a fearful Mr. Market may be valuing the same company way below its intrinsic value.

New business initiatives such as Groupon Goods and the Breadcrumb point-of-sale (POS) system has led the recovery, and we expect Q4 earnings to show the results of its changing business model. The company has introduced enhancements to the POS system with features such as inventory management and even acquired a real time location sharing maker, Glassmap, to enhance its location based deal business, Groupon Now!.Check out our complete analysis of GrouponGroupon Goods Will Stabilize RevenuesGroupon Goods is a move away from its traditional deals business as the company is trying to achieve more stable revenue growth, something that the volatile daily deals business has not been able to deliver. While the e-tailing business may provide stable revenues, it is likely to hit the margins as this is a lower margin business than the deals business.Groupon released an outlook for Q4 2012 and expects revenue to be between $625 – $675 million, an increase of 27-37% y-o-y. Income from operations for Q4 2012 is expected to be between $0 to $20 million, compared with a loss of $15 million in Q4 2011. As it streamlines its international business along the lines of its North American business, we expect revenues to grow.New Business Growth Key For Q4This earnings release for Groupon may be a sign of things to come  in 2013. While predominantly a daily deals site, Groupon has rolled out a number of promising tools and services targeted at local businesses. See: Groupon Aspires To Become ‘OS For Local Business’ With Breadcrumb Enhancements. The company is offering services and platforms with the hopes of becoming the ecosystem for local businesses. The payments services will help its customers process Groupons easily and receive payments quickly while the iPad-based POS will enable merchants to set up payment and sales systems for much cheaper than traditional POS services.While the traditional metrics for its core businesses are a primary concern, we will keep a close eye on Groupon’s long-term strategy and its new initiatives, which should drive growth for its daily deals offering, going forward.We currently have a $4 Trefis price estimate for Groupon, which stands nearly 30% below its market price. Daily deals account for a major portion of its overall value. It competes primarily with LivingSocial backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Offers, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and many clones.Disclosure: No positions"
1212721,43841,2013-02-21T16:17:58-05:00,,"Now is the time to invest in Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). The company has finally found its footing and its place in the industry, and now that it is more fairly-valued than a year ago, the stock is poised for continued growth. Here's why:General Positive Industry TrendThe U.S. e-commerce market continues to grow at an accelerating rate, and GRPN is poised to control a decisive piece of this market. Forrester Research projects the industry to see a compound annual growth rate of over 10% for the next four years, from $202 billion in 2011 to $327 billion in 2016. With GRPN's rapid growth rate, which is discussed below, the company is continuing to seize market share from the competition.Competitive LandscapeAs noted above, the overall industry trend is positive for online retailers. It is a bullish industry - consumer actions are shifting from traditional in-store purchases to e-commerce. As we often see, this is a case of all boats rising with the rising tide. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are both terrific businesses that are seeing earnings growth based on positive industry trends. GRPN fits well into the category, and even provides for certain points of differentiation. Although the world of e-commerce has seen a burst of new deal websites on the scene during the past two years, GRPN is still the most well-capitalized of them all. It sees the highest traffic and the highest revenues. It shows terrific promise for growth versus value, because whether our economy is growing or shrinking, the new consumer is deal-focused. In fact, AMZN and EBAY have both launched new businesses focusing on attracting deal-seeking consumers. AMZN's Gold Box and EBAY's Daily Deals are proof that the deal seekers are dominating the current e-commerce landscape, and GRPN's firm hold as the number one player has them poised for tremendous growth and continued success.Continued Innovation and Ease of UseOne of the most appealing things about GRPN is its ease of use. Deals are targeted to the consumer based on his own criteria selections and his location. Additionally, GRPN continues to innovate in the deal space and they consistently offer valuable, relevant deals. As compared with their competitors who tend to focus more on impulse purchases of products, GRPN offers deals that the majority of the population can use on an everyday basis.The landscape is shifting and deal-offering e-commerce sites are becoming the norm. GRPN has led the deal revolution, and with companies like Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) committing to 100% price match of online retailers, the low-price competition is about to heat up even further. GRPN offers deals far below MSRP (typically more than 50%) for products that consumers continually use/need (oil changes, restaurants, family leisure). Deals have become the new norm, and GRPN is the industry leader.Fundamental AnalysisGRPN's initial valuation was far too high at $12.8 billion. The stock has suffered considerably since the IPO 15 months ago, losing nearly 78% of its market cap since reaching highs of over $26 shortly after the offering. The offering was the richest for an internet company since Google's IPO in 2004. Simply, the valuation was over-inflated and investors knew it.The year-long continued negative trend from the IPO in November 2012 has turned in a big way. After reaching lows of $2.63 in mid-November, the stock has rallied some 125% and is currently trading intraday at $5.90.The fundamentals are quite strong for a new company. In the overall marketplace, GRPN is still finding its place and learning its niche. That might sound strange for a $4 billion company, but it is still a relatively young brand. It is competing with some heavy hitters with lots of cash. It's done a tremendous job of maintaining simplicity within the company - consumers confidently know that GRPN is the place to go to find daily deals.GRPN has exceeded or matched the street's earnings expectations the last three quarters. This is a tremendous sign of strength for a new company. While it didn't earn much in its first fiscal year, it exceeded expectations, and that shows management's ability to return on investment, even when it is not expected.GrowthAs noted in the fundamental analysis, and as is evident with the industry trends, GRPN is a tremendous growth story. Now that the stock has come significantly down from its over-inflated IPO price, it is finally ready to grow. Earnings estimates forecast the company growing 47% year over year, with EPS growing from $.17 to $.25, which is a far greater advance than the company's industry competition. It has made a quick move to profitability from an ugly first fiscal quarter in 2011, and the growth story is certainly in tact. Forward P/E for 2013 is 24.79, which is significantly cheaper than AMZN at 180.95x and in line with EBAY at 19.96.The company continues to add to the portfolio of deal businesses. While it has  succeeded mostly in the past with experience-oriented deals (car wash, oil change, vacations), GRPN is now making a push into the consumer goods category, and in doing so is directly stepping on the toes of giants AMZN and EBAY, among other smaller names like Woot! and 1SaleADay. Look for consumer goods sales to grow in 2013 with a broader range of goods offered and a ramped-up effort to move increased amounts of product.Chart AnalysisTechnical analysis looks excellent on GRPN. The short-term 50-day chart shows a bold, consistent uptrend that has accelerated in recent days because of analyst action on the stock. The price is making higher highs and higher lows There is a positive trend in the Relative Strength Index as well, with a support level at approximately 50 and a resistance level at approximately 70. Similarly, momentum has remained consistent during the short term. Finally, the stock has traded positively within the moving average envelope and continues to do that with a positive bias. The technical analysis seems to be trending positively.GRPN 100-Day ChartThe CallI'm a buyer of GRPN at current price levels. I have a price target of $7 and to maximize upside while hedging risk, I'm a buyer of July 4.50 calls. With a premium right around $1.80, there is only $.30 of time value built in and the option will be at the money with just a 6% gain in underlying stock price. The July call gives a long enough time horizon to absorb any potential bad news noted in earnings (though I'm expecting a beat and mild to positive forecast). Investors can also build an equity position here at $5.95, averaging down on any dips and adding to the position on any continued positive trend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1107491,22762,2013-01-11T13:06:33-05:00,,"By Ingrid LundenGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) CEO Andrew Mason last year set his company a goal  of adding more value and diversity to its bread and butter business in  daily deals, and today it took one more step in that direction: Groupon Payments — its dongle-based Square/PayPal Here competitor — has now been added to its Merchants app for Android handsets.Groupon Payments first launched in September, but was available only  for iOS devices. This new version, which was first soft-launched at the  end of December, will give Groupon a much better crack at critical mass  for the payments service. For now, the launch is U.S.-only, where Android  devices now account for over 50% of all smartphones in use.As with the iOS app (and in keeping with what competitors are doing),  the primary purpose of Groupon Payments is to give merchants, especially  smaller merchants, a cost-effective way to take card payments.  But by rolling it into Groupon Merchants, the company is hoping for  more sticky usage and traction by rolling it in with other features.  This is not unlike what companies like Square are doing, with the  concept of a merchant dashboard now almost table stakes in the mobile  commerce game.The Groupon version of that concept includes the ability to redeem  Groupon deals, scan barcodes, view transaction history, add tips and  taxes, make refunds, email receipts, and look at other purchasing and  daily deals analytics to track things such as how well a particular deal  performed. It also says it provides support seven days a week to those  with any issues, and guarantees security on transactions.What it has yet to do is extend Android to support Breadcrumb, the point of sale app that Groupon bought and offers on iPad devices  to manage different aspects of running restaurants and cafes —  including menus, ordering and labor management, and Groupon Payments.The fees that Groupon charges Groupon Merchants for payments are 1.8%  on Visa, MasterCard and Discover when swiped, 2.3% when keyed in, plus  $0.15 for each transaction. American Express pricing is more complicated,  as it is “determined by American Express based on your industry  category.” The rates range from 2.3%-3.5% (swiped) and $0.00 to $0.15  per transaction, says Groupon. For non-Groupon Merchants, the fees are  higher: 2.2% when MasterCard, Visa and Discover are swiped, plus $0.15  per transaction.Like a lot of companies, Groupon has focused the majority of its  first-try efforts on iOS users, extending them to Android in a second  wave of growth. Groupon told me in December,  when it was releasing a major update for its iPad app, that this is  partly because Groupon develops first on the platforms that are used  most by its audience. (Which is also why we’ve seen little, so far, from  Groupon for Windows Phone and Windows 8.)Tablets is one game where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still the dominant player, but  when it comes to smartphones, Android is the biggest platform in the  world. Gartner’s most recent figures  for worldwide smartphone shipments from Q3 noted that Android  accounted for 72% of all shipments worldwide. In the U.S. specifically,  the figures are not as high, but still strong: ComScore’s most recent numbers, out in January, noted that Android was on 53.7% of all smartphones in use in the U.S., versus 35% for the iPhone.Groupon has so far not released any figures on how Groupon Payments  has fared on the iPhone, saying only that it has seen “great reception.” But it may be that the smaller, price-sensitive, independent  local merchants that Groupon targets may be more likely to use Android  handsets, which come at a range of prices and are often significantly  less expensive than iPhones.There are at least some that have been waiting for Groupon to add  Android to its list of supported platforms. ”Heaven forbid if you have  an Android phone though,” one person wrote sarcastically on Groupon’s blog post announcing the launch of Groupon Payments on iOS in September. “Nevermind that there are far more of them than iPhones….”Groupon’s share price has been growing  in the last couple of months with promises of improved revenues going  forward, so it needs all the new services it can add to reach that goal.  In the company’s last quarterly results, it reported results below expectations, with earnings per share of $0.00. Other strategies at the company have included adding restaurant reservations with its purchase of Savored, and a B2B service powering daily deals for other brands like Major League Baseball. Yesterday, it said that it would be releasing Q4 and full-year results on February 27.Original Post"
1076801,24674,2012-12-21T02:43:42-05:00,,"Recently, CNBC declared Andrew Mason of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) as the worst CEO of the 2012. He headlined an undistinguished list of underachievers, poor managers, and short-sighted men. This list also includes Steve Ballmer of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Ron Johnson of J.C. Penney (JCP), Mark Pincus of Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), and Antonio Perez of Eastman Kodak (EKDKQ) in that order. Honorable mentions also include Stephen Elop of Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Daniel Hesse of Sprint Nextel (NYSE:S). All of these CEOs and their respective companies have had a very bad year. Steve Ballmer heard a giant thud when Windows 8 and the Surface hit the market. Stephen Elop can't seem to abate Nokia's slide in market share; more importantly, his and Nokia's fate are very closely tied to Steve Ballmer and Microsoft. I'm not sure why Daniel Hesse is still a CEO; Sprint Nextel has seen a precipitated decline in revenue, market share, and his Board recently overruled his attempted takeover of MetroPCS. Zynga seems to be imploding with layoffs, crashing revenue, exodus of talent, and a dramatic shift in strategy. Zynga leaders, including Mr. Pincus, completely misjudged the future of their market. At J.C. Penney, Ron Johnson tried to turn a 110-year-old discount retailer into a high-end department store; clearly, it didn't work. With Antonio Perez, the story is a little trickier as film is a dead medium, and he is stuck with a company that is unable to compete with Sony, Apple, and other device manufacturers that had a big head start. Now we come to Andrew Mason.Generally, I think CNBC is crap. It's the Fox News of financial news. Generally, I also think that rankings and lists of the worst this and best whatever are catalysts for pointless discussions. However in this case, Herb Greenberg (the guy who came up with the list) makes some good points. I think Steve Ballmer is and has always been way over his head in leading Microsoft. Daniel Hesse really has not demonstrated a capacity to add value; in fact, since 2007 when he was hired as the CEO, Sprint's stock price has lost 80 percent of its value. Stephen Elop has been the CEO of Nokia for only two years but he seems to be manning the Titanic. But when it comes to Andrew Mason, I think Mr. Greenberg is being a bit unfair.The main argument that Groupon haters make for why the company sucks is that the stock price has plunged 80 percent since its IPO last year. This is true. After a huge fanfare and hype, the stock traded at more than $31. Since then, we all know what's happened. The stock took a dive; the company had to restate earnings; it came under additional accounting scrutiny; revenue growth slowed, and Andrew Mason was nearly fired. That's a lot of bad stuff. However, I am going to try and defend Mr. Mason.In regards to the accounting scandal, Groupon had admitted to having weak internal controls for conducting refunds. Apparently, their system just didn't do a good job of keeping track and issuing refunds. However, while accounting issues and concerns at publicly traded companies are never acceptable and those who demonstrate incompetence or negligence in this area should be fired immediately, Groupon was a very young company that grew far faster than anyone, including Andrew Mason, could have ever imagined. So while it is fair to argue that company leaders, including Mason, are not fit to lead, they were also in uncharted territory. You can also easily argue that they grew faster than their capacity - i.e. growing pains. So, while their accounting problems are not forgettable, they are forgivable.In regards to revenue, what goes up must come down. No company can grow at an exponential rate forever. Yes, Groupon's growth has slowed dramatically, but so has the global economy. Don't forget that we're still in a global recession. More importantly, year-over-year revenue is still up more than 32 percent. As of December 19, 2012, the stock was trading at less than 1.2x sales. That isn't bad. For perspective sake, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading just above 2.0x sales.Despite the tremendous rhetoric around Groupon, it still has a lot of good things going for it. First, it will likely be the last daily deal website standing. LivingSocial, Groupon's primary competitor, seems to be dying away, and Amazon no longer seems all that into daily deals anymore. More importantly, Groupon has about 79 percent of the daily deal traffic while LivingSocial only has about 8 percent. Second, less than half of all shoppers are aware of the group buying category. This means that as word spread and as competitor's die away, Groupon stands to grow. Third, Groupon's user base continues to grow at fairly good rate. From Q3 2011 to Q3 2012, Groupon's user base grew from about 29 million to nearly 40 million. The fourth and most important asset that Groupon has is its relationship with small businesses around the globe. This is not an easy asset to acquire and Groupon made that relationship stickier by launching Groupon Payments.Not everything with Groupon has been rosy in terms of business strategy. Although I can be wrong in the long run, I believe that Groupon Goods is a mistake. Why would Groupon want to be involved in warehouse management, product sourcing, fulfillment, and other massive headaches that come along with being Amazon? I get there is fierce competition between Amazon and Groupon given Amazon's purchase of LivingSocial, but Groupon is winning the daily deal battle. It has done a good job capturing the market. So why add a low margin business to your high margin business and divide your attention that way? I can't answer that question.I wasn't totally opposed to the idea of Andrew Mason being fired. He has gone out of his way to be quirky and goofy. These are not qualities I seek in a guy who is running a company that I am a shareholder in. There was also a prevailing sense that Andrew and his cohorts thought of themselves as being smarter than everyone else. I want a CEO who is clear, honest, and forthright. Andrew Mason did not always appear to have those qualities - at least to those of us looking in. With that said, I still don't think he was as bad as Steve Ballmer, Mark Pincus, Daniel Hess, or Stephen Elop. These guys had historic losses and brought confusion to their company's strategic path. I don't think Mr. Mason even belongs in the same conversation.Daily deals or group buying as a category still has room in the retail landscape. It's an opportunity for small and large businesses to move massive volume in short order and for the consumer to benefit by business's desire to clear its shelves. This is a win-win. That's why this category isn't going anywhere soon. Remember that Amazon also had some serious growing pain in its early years; Amazon stock price had traded below $6. Groupon has a bright future. If Europe can get its act together and we can get out of this recession, why wouldn't Groupon resume its rapid growth rate? If you have a short-term investment horizon, Groupon isn't for you. However, if you can sit on your hands for the next two to three years, there is a good chance that Groupon will be back to its IPO levels.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

Moreover, analysts are anticipating a high next five years growth rate of 25% per annum.Financial HighlightsGRPN reported its 4Q'12 financial results yesterday, 27th February. The results for the quarter came below the analysts' consensus. The company reported the recent fourth quarter revenues of $638 million, up 30% on a year-over-year basis, missing the analysts' consensus of $650 million. In the recent fourth quarter 41% of the total revenues were earned by the international markets segment and remaining 59% was contributed by the North American segment. International market revenues for the quarter were down 16% on a year-over-year, whereas North American revenues were up 110% year over year. The following chart shows revenues of GRPN for the last six quarters.Source: Company Reports.Gross billing for the recent quarter increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.5 billion, whereas gross profit of $356 million for the fourth quarter was down approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis. GRPN has been struggling to maintain its gross margin in the recent quarters. I believe the decline in the gross margin is a result of the company's decision to prioritize growth. The following chart shows gross margin of GRPN for the last five quarters.Source: Company Reports and CalculationsGRPN also failed to register healthy consolidated segment operating income (CSOI), which was down to $13.7 million in 4Q'12 as compared to $18 million in 4Q'11. Furthermore, GRPN posted a loss of $0.01 per share in 4Q'12, missing the analysts' EPS consensus of $0.01.GRPN's take rate for 4Q'12 was 42%, up 2% on a year-over-year basis. However, take rate for the quarter was down 4% on a quarter on quarter basis. The following chart displays GRPN's take rate for the last six quarters.Source: Company ReportsMarketing expenditures and active customer growth for the quarter were positive takeaways from the recent earnings release. Marketing expenses for the quarter were down from 32% of total revenue in 4Q'11 to 10% of the total revenue in 4Q'12. Moreover, the company was able to expand its active customers base to 41 million in 4Q'12, an increase of 1.5 million quarter on quarter.(Click to enlarge)Source: Presentation SlidesOutlookGRPN provided a 1Q'13 revenue guidance range of $560 - $610 million, representing an expected increase of 0% to 9% on a year-over-year basis. Operating (loss) income guidance range for 1Q'13 was ($10) to $10 million. Also, GRPN is expecting stock based compensation of $30 million for the first quarter of 2013.Moreover, analysts are anticipating a high earnings growth rate of almost 25% per annum for the next five years. Following are the analysts' EPS forecast for GRPN.Source: Nasdaq.comConclusionI remain bullish on GRPN despite disappointing results for the last quarter. GRPN has a large potential market to address, which will help the company to expand its top and bottom lines. Also, it needs to expand deals offered by the company and improve upon its ""deal relevance"" -- targeting the right customers according to their demands and needs characteristics.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1112221,39791,2013-01-15T07:52:59-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is one of the most hyped Internet stocks to IPO in the last couple of years. The company raised over $800 million from investors caught in the Internet 2.0 mania. The company, whose business model consists of selling discount deals, has dealt massive losses to its investors. Groupon's stock has declined by over 70% in the last year due to a number of management blunders and a weak business model. After hitting a low of $2.6, the stock has more than doubled to $5.35 in the last couple of months. We think that investors should sell into the rally as the company does not have a coherent business strategy and suffers low competitive barriers with slowing growth prospects.Why we would sell GrouponUpside RisksAcquisition by bigger technology company - Google had tried to buy Groupon for $6 billion, but the GRPN management rejected the offer. GRPN now trades at a 30% discount to the original offer made by Google. There have been many expensive acquisitions made in the technology industry and it is not unlikely that Groupon could be bought by one of the technology giants like Amazon.Stock Price PerformanceThe company's stock price performance has been quite abysmal, showing continuous losses since its inception as a publicly-traded stock. The stock has given a 100% bounce, after declining 90% from its peak value of ~$26. Despite the massive fall, the company still does not look attractive enough to buy and we would sell the rally to look for better options.SummaryWe don't think that Groupon offers a decent risk reward profile at the current stock price and valuation. The company is trying to enter highly competitive internet businesses, such as online retail and payments, at the same time. The company has realized its core discount deal business model is at a dead end and it is desperately trying to enter new ones. The company's CEO is not sure how long he will retain his position and the company's acquisitions don't make a whole lot of sense. We don't think management knows what it wants to do and where it wants to go. The only upside risk is if Groupon gets bought by a bigger technology company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1054241,25106,2012-12-10T05:49:00-05:00,,"Shares of Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) have surged nearly 70% since I turned bullish on the stock just a month ago.GRPN data by YChartsGoogle Takeover SpeculationGRPN shares have benefited from rumors that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is considering making a bid for GRPN. This news does not come as a surprise to me. In my previous article, I listed a potential takeover as a reason why I was turning bullish on GRPN. Now, however, with takeover rumors becoming more mainstream, it must be noted that the market is beginning to price in a greater likelihood of a deal. If no deal materializes soon, GRPN shares will likely experience some selling pressure. If a deal does materialize, I expect GRPN to receive a significant premium to the current price.Tiger Global Takes 9.9% StakeTiger Global Management, a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, recently disclosed a 9.9% stake in GRPN. The stake has been described as passive, not activist. In addition to Tiger Global Management, investor George Soros also recently disclosed a new stake in GRPN. I view these stakes as a vote of confidence in GRPN. However, it must be noted that both Tiger and Soros likely paid significantly less for GRPN shares than the current price.Andrew Mason To Remain CEOFollowing rumors that CEO Andrew Mason may be forced out of his position, GRPN in late November confirmed that Mason will remain CEO. In my previous article, I argued that having Mason as CEO was a positive. While many unhappy GRPN investors may have liked to see Mason replaced, I believe that he is the right guy to lead the company through a transformational time.ConclusionWith GRPN shares up nearly 70% in a month, I think it makes sense for investors to take at least some profits. I tend to believe in the saying ""bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered."" Perhaps investors who bought GRPN close to its all time low of $2.60 should sell enough to recover their initial investment and let the rest run. While I think more upside is more likely than not, GRPN is a riskier trade at these levels than it was at $2.60, especially considering GRPN's $1.82 in cash per share. For investors who are not yet involved in the stock, I would look to buy shares on a pullback below $4.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1055761,22445,2012-12-10T16:47:35-05:00,,"On November the 11th I wrote to you about Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) (Groupon Finally Lands On Planet Earth), saying:Indeed the stock had only two more days of limited negative price action and it was all uphill from there. In fact, the stock has almost doubled since then.The reason for the jump in Groupon's stock on Friday was primarily an article in Bloomberg that said Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was considering making a bid for the company.While Google has not confirmed its interest in the company and Groupon itself is not saying anything, chances are that the Bloomberg story has some truth to it.So far as of the writing of this article, Google and Groupon have declined to comment on these speculation rumors and that in my book is evidence that something is going on. If Google was not interested and if nothing was going on, then Google would simply say that it was not interested and speculation would end right there. So in my book, Google is probably interested.Why would Google then be interested Groupon? Well because that's what Google does. It buys other companies and tweaks their business model and makes them work. My hunch is that Google wants to buy Groupon because they have come up with some good ideas on how to leverage the coupon business with Google's current product mix. I don't know what's on their minds, but if anyone can make the coupon business work, that would be Google.Imagine this: Every time you use Google's search engine, in addition to ads, deals would also pop up based on your geographic location. In order for Groupon to be able to get this kind of advertising exposure today. they would literally have to pay through the nose and might make the coupon business unprofitable. But this will not cost Google anything. They own the search space and they command what types of banners or ads they display.So why would Google want to buy Groupon instead of doing it on their own? Well for one thing the whole coupon business was Groupon's idea and since they were there first, they are the leader in the space.Also, Groupon is a well established international name brand. Even though Groupon doesn't make money today, it's probably cheaper (and a safer bet) for Google to fork out several billion dollars today than spend several billion to penetrate the space and establish the Google brand in the coupon spaceAnd the more I think about it, I think Google can make a lot of money in the coupon business if they leverage Groupon with its product mix, especially search. And by a lot of money, I don't mean several hundred million dollars, but a whole lot more.Figuring out what Google might be willing to pay for Groupon is not easy. But remember, Google doesn't look at Groupon like an individual stock the way you and me would look at it. The value Google will put on Groupon will be a function of the synergies between Groupon and Google's mix, especially search.Personally I have a wild imagination and I actually think Google might make tons of money in the long term with a Groupon acquisition, and as such, I think they might pay more than we can imagine.Obviously everything is subject to speculation, for we don't know what's on Google's mind. So it all comes down to what Google is willing to pay for Groupon and what their business models say.In either case, I think that a Groupon acquisition makes good sense for Google and will in no way impact Google's stock in the short term, and long term I think the synergies will be more than worth what they might be willing to pay for it, assuming they are indeed interested.If you have the stock, I advise you hold it, if you don't, buy it only if you think a Google deal is imminent and if you think Google would be willing pay a premium to enter the coupon space.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1055121,39231,2012-12-10T13:02:21-05:00,,"I continue to take a positive stance on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and with this article I will comment on the rumored takeover of GRPN by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The representatives of both companies, however, have declined to comment on this.Last week I did a complete investment thesis on Groupon, which can be viewed here.On Friday, last week, a rumor of Google buying Groupon had surfaced, which led to a 23% surge in Groupon's share price, closing at $4.69. Since the IPO last year, Groupon's stock price has fallen by more than 80%. Given the strong and innovative business model, along with a growing customer base and cheap valuations, I held the view that Groupon offers an attractive investment opportunity.Couple of years back, before Groupon's IPO, Google was rumored to want to pay $6 billion to acquire the company. As of now, Groupon has grown in size and is valued more attractively with a market cap of almost $3 billion. If Google does indeed move ahead with its rumored offer, this is what awaits the giant in the transaction: Groupon currently has significant cash amounting to $1.2 billion on its balance sheet coupled with almost $820 million merchant payables and accrued expenses. This leaves net cash of ~$400 million for Google if it acquires Groupon. Also, we need to factor in the benefit of $600 million in form of accumulated tax losses for Google once the transaction in complete.There is also a perception in the market that Google would not acquire Groupon as it will have a negative impact on Google's stock. This might be true for the shorter-term but not for the longer-term period as Groupon grows and delivers better performance. Currently the industry in which Groupon operates is going through a rough patch. The players in the industry are reducing their overheads and are eyeing to tap growth opportunities. The second biggest online daily deal provider, Living Social, is cutting almost 400 jobs and plans to increase marketing and mobile spending.If the rumor of Google buying Groupon fades out, Groupon share price will drop and shares will trade in a price range similar to the range prior to the rumor. However, in the medium to long term share price will increase as I believe Groupon has a strong business model, is the leading daily deal provider with ~40 million active customers and has a large addressable market around the world. Groupon also has a competitive advantage in shape of a large sales force, huge customer base and strong merchant relationships.Groupon entered in a multi year partnership with Major League Baseball (MLB) Advanced Media for upcoming 2013 season, and will be MLB's official daily deals site. The deals would be available on Groupon's platform ""GrouponLive."" This will help the company grow its revenues.There are some investor concerns in relation to Groupon's CEO, who is seen by many as a misfit. However, there are no immediate plans to replace him. The board did meet last month to decide the fate of the CEO, but there was no decision made to replace him.Risks Groupon has been facing competition in the industry from Living Social, Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) which has contracted the margins and growth for the company. One of the major reasons for Groupon's share price drop since the IPO has been competition, which has caused margins to decline.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1052961,21950,2012-12-08T12:29:09-05:00,,"On November 8, 2012, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported earnings that disappointed the market. The following day the stock fell a stomach-churning 30% to fresh all-time lows. A week later, on November 15th, shares short GRPN settled 21% higher than levels on October 31st, producing short interest 21% of GRPN's float. In just two more weeks, GRPN's stock price surged 57%.Groupon shares short are off the highs but November earnings encouraged a fresh surge in short interestSource: NASDAQ.com short interestThis is the crowded theater into which someone (or some traders) yelled ""fire"" on Friday, December 7th with breathless rumors of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) potentially acquiring GRPN, sending GRPN to a 23% one-day gain. This rumor had enough meat on it to motivate Bloomberg TV to spend two and a half minutes discussing the prospects. Reporter Cory Johnson failed to find any good reason for such an acquisition. Instead, he spent time explaining how GRPN's massive cash balance is greatly reduced by liabilities (merchant payables) and accrued expenses and warning how GRPN's coupon business has ground to a halt.While rumors of an acquisition are questionable at best, there are other reasons to get bullish on GRPN for at least the next month or so. The stock's recent ability to print such large gains on strong buying volume is indicative of the potential for even more gains. For example, traders may already be positioning for the ""January effect"" where the most beaten up stocks tend to rally after tax-related selling subsides. This year is particularly interesting given common fears over increases in taxes starting in 2013 which could boost traditional tax-related trading. This window of upside opportunity reverses my bearish opinions from March and April where I recommended that investors stay away from GRPN.A short squeeze is not likely the complete explanation for GRPN's recent success since the total 43.5M shares short are less than the 50.9M shares traded Friday alone (a 175% increase over the 3-month rolling average). Granted, the run-up from the bottom has put every new short from the first two weeks of November underwater and should intensify the pressure on shorts in the final weeks of this year to exit the trade. But we cannot verify a short squeeze until the next update on short interest comes in another week or so. As the chart above suggests shorts may actually be in the process of increasing their bearish bets.Here are the stock charts for context.Groupon's impressive surge off all-time lows...the surge off the bottom does little to repair a dismal year where GRPN is still down 77% from its IPO priceSource: FreeStockCharts.comGRPN is probably a stock that should never have gone public. This year has been a complete disaster. However, note the record volume surge in GRPN after its November earnings report. The subsequent strength in the stock seems to confirm GRPN has finally printed a bottom. The crescendo of selling may have washed out the last motivated sellers. This potential bottom forms the foundation for a year-end rally.After GRPN reported earnings in early November, it solidified its status as one of the most hated stocks of a dismal lot of stocks related to the internet and social networking. Even analysts are sour on GRPN: of 23 analysts covering the stock, 19 rate GRPN as a hold and 3 rate GRPN a strong sell; one lone analyst stubbornly gives GRPN a strong buy rating.GRPN's collapse has produced one of the lowest valuations amongst internet-related stocks. Even with the current run-up, GRPN has a price-to-sales ratio of just 1.1.Price-to-Sales Ratios of Various Internet-Related Companies From March 6, 2012 to December 7, 2012Source: Data collected at select times from Yahoo!FinanceThe above chart tracks how the price-to-sales ratio has changed over the course of the year for a select group of internet-related stocks. I sorted the chart in ascending order from left to right based on the latest price-to-sales ratios. GRPN in particular has gone from one of the most highly valued to one of the least valued of these stocks in just nine months. (Note that I did not track all stocks in March).This precipitous decline in relative standing is understandable. In GRPN's last earnings report, the company confirmed that revenue growth has come to a standstill. The first three quarters of the year each delivered $559 to $569M in revenue and guidance for the fourth quarter of ~14% growth simply matches the seasonal uptick the company saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Stock-based compensation expense matched operating income in the third quarter and drove net income to zero. As GRPN has slashed marketing expense every quarter to maintain EPS numbers, the growth in active customers has slowed to a trickle. GRPN grew active customers just 3.9% in the third quarter.A contrarian might look at this entire situation and rationalize that the business has finally hit rock bottom or at least that sentiment against the stock cannot get much worse (until the next negative catalyst of course - like earnings in February).The options trading in GRPN adds a final element of intrigue. The open interest for December expiration is heavily concentrated on puts. In particular, there are 21,252 put contracts open at the December $3.50 strike. This open interest is 3 to 4 times the size of all other open interest. According to Etrade.com, this huge open interest arrived on October 26th and has held relatively constant since…even after the puts nearly tripled in value after GRPN's disastrous November earnings. Yet, from that point to today, the overall put/call open interest has steadily dropped from an all-time high of around 1.9 to 1.0. In other words, traders are potentially getting more bullish based on the steady accumulation of call options and/or shorts have been increasingly hedging their bearish bets (note I have learned to interpret options trading with a heavy dose of caution). Since the current put/call ratio is still at the 76th percentile for the past 52-weeks there is still plenty of room for more bullishness. Friday's rumor-stoked trading sent call volume soaring. From weeklies expiring December 14th to options expiring in January, call volume greatly overwhelmed put volume.So while the occasional vicious rumor should continue to goose GRPN higher, there is plenty of additional/potential tinder laying around to send sparks flying: ""bargain-hunting"" for playing the January effect, a wash-out of motivated sellers, a likely extreme in negative sentiment, call option buying, and maybe even a short squeeze. At a bare minimum, I would not want to be short GRPN under the current circumstances. Instead, I will be looking for an opening (and an excuse) to get long GRPN.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

1043321,39231,2012-12-04T08:39:55-05:00,,"Continued take rate improvement, a great business model and a growing number of active customers makes me bullish on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). The business model is an innovative one and with its progression, we see new products and services being introduced that will allow an expanding customer base. Yes the stock is down since its inception but I believe the worst is priced in. Several positive indications, which I will cite below in the sections, point towards the changing face of the business, but the industry as a whole remains difficult to be accurately analyzed and risks relating to projections and competition remain. The company is guiding improvement in both billing and revenue growth for 4Q as it sees itself propelling into the international business based on its experience in the U.S. Though investors remain shaky, I believe the business model is solid and as the company matures, offers exciting new deals and provides merchants with access to customers, the stock is headed nowhere but up. I hold the view that at current valuation, GRPN is a great investment opportunity.Company overview Groupon is an e-commerce platform that connects consumers and merchants. The company is headquartered in Chicago, was founded in late 2008 and went public in November 2011. It has a long lasting business model, whereby it offers discounted goods and services to customers. Deals offered by the company are customized according to customers' personal preference and location and are available through the company's website and mobile apps.The company manifests significant growth potential with a $500 billion global advertising addressable market. Growth opportunities are further enhanced as the company intends to expand into travel and events market.Financial Performance  Since going public in Nov 2011 the stock has plunged 80%.Source: Bloomberg.comDespite Groupon's great business model, the company has been struggling to deliver financial results and unable to live up to the expectations of the street. The unsatisfactory financial performance by Groupon took a toll on the stock since its IPO; evident by the graph above.Groupon has increased its revenue sharply over the years. Reported revenues for 3Q were $569 million, up 32% year over year. As almost half of the revenue is generated through its international segment, a strengthening dollar reduced the total revenue by 6%. Although year over year revenue growth for 3Q was solid, the company did not achieve impressive quarter over quarter growth. North American segment revenues grew at an accelerating rate and were up 80% year over year.Earning per share (adjusted) for the 3Q12 was $0.03, in line analyst's expectation. The EPS was better when compared with the 3Q11's loss of $0.04 per share. Graphs below show gross and EBIT margin for Groupon in the last four quarters.Growing number of active numbers is an encouraging development. Should Groupon continue to grow its active customers at a decent pace, the company will be on track to achieve a solid financial performance in the coming quarters. According to 3Q earnings release Groupon has 39.5 mm active customers. Source: Earnings Presentation.Take rate for the company has been showing consistent improvement over the recent quarters. Currently the take rate stands at 47%. The trend is a positive catalyst for the stock since it would uplift the company's margins and eventually the share price.4Q outlook remained mixed with revenue guidance of $625mm - 675mm, against consensus of $635mm. CSOI guidance for fourth quarter is $30mm - $50mm.Recent News Last month, Groupon launched its first concept store in Hong Kong. This will help the company expand its operations/revenue along with increasing customer awareness about Groupon. For the very first time it has allowed customers to experience Groupon in a tangible interactive way. Groupon started its 3rd annual ancient celebration 'Grouponicus'.Key Catalysts  Groupon's largest asset remains its large addressable market. Conversion rate - turning subscribers into actual shoppers also holds key for the company success. To bring about the success, it has to focus on targeting the right customers respective to their needs and demands (deal relevance). Moreover, as Groupon has a large market, it must continually come up with deals in order to fully utilize the potential market.Risks In the presence of some really attractive growth opportunities, there are also some risks. Since the industry is relatively new, accurate projection of trends and key drivers remains a cumbersome task. Groupon also must face competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Living Social. This potentially limits expansion of its margins and take rate. Overall, the consumer sentiment prevailing in the economy can influence the business. To conclude On a simple comparative analysis, GRPN seems to be trading at cheaper multiples. It trades at 1.2x its sales compared to 1.9x of Amazon and 4.6x of Google. I have a bullish view on the stock given the recent encouraging developments, specially relating to its expanding active user base. Take rate expansion and a potentially huge market also augur well for its future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1034511,34211,2012-11-29T04:30:34-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) closed at an all-time low of $2.76 on Friday November 9th trading after disappointing 3Q 2012 results. In opening trade on Monday November 12th the share price hovered around that price, even sliding a little bit more. Market expectations of 3Q revenue of $591 million were disappointing as Groupon's revenues came in lower at $568 million, below Groupon's own forecasted range of $580 to $620 million range. This translated into losses of $3 million for the quarter and breaking even on a per-share basis, with a 29% decrease in Groupon's share value on Friday from an opening price of over $3 the same day. The net loss, reversing positive operating income, was due to stock compensation and expenses related to acquisitions of more than $25 million. Groupon's revenue forecast for 4Q 2012 was not very encouraging either, with a range of $625 million to $675 million, while analysts were forecasting revenues of $635 million.Among second tier technology start-ups Groupon was once, perhaps, the most promising. It, along with companies such as China's Baidex and Russia's Yandu, as well as Zynga, were some of the most promising. Now, we're seeing Groupon's faults more clearly - an easily copied business plan and poor future planning.When Groupon went public in November of 2011 its share price was $20 and it reached an all-time high of $26. Since then, it has fallen by more than 86%, a precipitous fall by any measure. What happened to Groupon for it to fall so far so fast? Especially for internet start-ups the expectations for growth are very high; it is certainly a matter of grow very fast or die. In this case, even though Groupon is just about breaking even and arguably on the cusp of being profitable, its growth has slowed down dramatically.In 3Q 2011 Groupon had operating income. Growth in the next two quarters was significant, going from $492m in the 4Q of 2011 to $559m in 1Q of 2012, making for percentage increases of, respectively, a little over 14% and less than 14%. Since then it has flat-lined. In 2Q 2012 it grew to $568m for an increase of less than 2%, and stayed virtually the same in 3Q 2012 at $569m.In the same period, its operating income has gone from being essentially zero in the 3Q of 2011, to a $15 million loss in the next quarter, to positive in the next three quarters. Operating income grew to $40 million in 1Q of 2012 and to $46 million in the next quarter, but then plunged to $25 million in 3Q 2012.A big part of Groupon's strategy has been expansion overseas. This expansion so far, though, has been confined pretty much to operating income. After a promising start, revenue from overseas operations has fallen in absolute terms. Revenue in Europe went from $269 million in 3Q 2011 to $313 million in the next quarter and to a high of $321 million in 1Q 2012. From then on, revenue in Europe has decreased to $308 million in 2Q 2012 and to $277 million in 3Q 2012, almost falling to the level of a year ago. Groupon's performance in Europe has been largely to blame for its dramatic slowdown in overall revenue since the North American market exhibited reasonable growth throughout this period.operating income exhibited a similar pattern. It went from a loss of $21 million in 3Q 2011 to essentially breaking even in the next quarter to a positive operating margin of $28 million in 1Q 2012. In the next quarter though it remained virtually the same, and in 3Q 2012, it fell to $11 million. Operating income in North America improved significantly at the start of 2012 over 2011, but then stalled and even registered a small decrease by the third quarter of 2012.This slowdown in revenue growth, and decrease in absolute terms in Europe, is paralleled and probably caused by a slowdown in operating income. From 28.9 million customers in 3Q 2011 Groupon went to 33.7 million in 4Q 2012 and to 36.9 million in the first quarter of 2012. In percentage terms this meant an increase of more than 16% from the fourth to the third quarters of 2011, and an increase of more than 9% from the first quarter of 2012 over the last quarter of 2011. From then on though, active customers have not increased by much, going to 38 million in 2Q 2012 and 39.5 million in the next quarter, for a percentage increase of only 8% over the last two quarters.Groupon has tried to diversify into direct sales online. In effect, it has increased its Groupon Goods line of business from 3% a year ago to more than a quarter of sales, but has not matched the profits generated by its online discount business. Groupon has also tried to diversify into mobile-payment applications to small businesses and through acquisitions of start-ups like Savored.Going forward Groupon will have to contend with difficult challenges. Europe is still mired in its sovereign debt crisis with virtually no growth expected in the near future, and a considerable down side risk that things will get a lot worse. There are new entrants to the same market Groupon is in, such as Living Social part-owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Groupon also has accounting issues with the SEC having to do with its refund policies. Even more worrying for its business model is the question of discount fatigue. Unless, and until, it can be seen to address some of these threats, Groupon is full of holes and not worth the worry for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was prepared for Freedonia Freelance by one of our analysts."
1108661,22445,2013-01-13T07:00:00-05:00,,"On November 11, right at the very bottom, I initiated coverage of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) saying it's a good long term investment (please consider:Groupon Finally Lands On Planet Earth). Although I cautioned buying until the dust settled, I also said if you see indication of technical strength on the charts, I would be a buyer.Since then, and if you considered my recommendation, you are probably about 100% ahead in that relatively short period. So now that some of you are sitting on all those profits, the question is how does one proceed from now on.The company has been busy the past couple of months. Among other news:Generally speaking I think the company is going in the right direction, but the question is, is that enough? Well we won't know until we get Q4 results and hear what the company has to say at their conference call on February 27. However, economic forensic evidence gives us some clues that things might not be that good.Bloomberg reported that CEO Andrew Mason is barely hanging on and that the board recently was thinking of firing him and finding a replacement. I don't think the board would contemplate something like this if things were fine. In fact it probably means that next quarter results will not be what many of us hoped for.On the positive side of things, firing Andrew Mason would probably be a positive catalyst for the stock, because when someone who has not done a good job gets replaced, it means the board is looking ahead and has learned its lesson.Another positive catalyst for the stock (at these levels) might be that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is still interested in the company. And as I pointed out a while ago, this would be positive for Google in many ways. It would also be positive for Groupon shareholders if the price was right.So before I give my verdict on what to do with the stock, lets look at the technical picture.The stock is approaching resistance at $5.35. Also, there is a technical gap back from August with heavy volume. So in order for the stock to break out and trend above these levels, I think we will have to see major buying action. If we don't, the stock will probably correct towards the $4 level.In order for the stock to see heavy buying action, we have to see substantial evidence (in the form of an official announcement) that growth is resuming and profits are accompanying that growth. But we won't know that until February 27. Also, the Bloomberg report was not exactly encouraging that things are going great.Also, while I was initially bullish on the stock from a pure valuation prospective, today the stock is not that cheap anymore. It could become a good buy, but only if growth resumes and we see some profits.Also, the stock has doubled from my first recommendation. Profits like these are not easy to come by and I am sure many investors will want to cash out.So this is my verdictFor those who bought the stock close to my recommendation levels, I say sell and lock in those profits. The stock needs solid positive news in order for enough buyers to come in and push prices higher.A Google take-over offer might push prices higher, but that is a wild-card and we can't really base our investment decision on a wild card.For those who have bought the stock at higher levels and are out of the money, I still think you'll get you money back, just that you will have to wait longer term.However, because timing is almost everything, if you are sitting on profits, take the money and run until we get a better picture of what is going on inside the company and what year end results will look like.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1033551,22762,2012-11-28T14:25:41-05:00,,"By Romain DilletDuring Business Insider's Ignition conference, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) CEO Andrew  Mason commented on yesterday's stories about his role at the company.  AllThingsD reported  that the board was discussing whether the company needed a new CEO.  Mason replied by stating that ""it would be weird if the board wasn't  discussing whether I'm the right guy for the job."" Groupon has gained  traction in an entirely new space and a lot of questions remain.""There is so much exciting stuff happening at the company,"" Mason  said. He emphasized the big opportunities in front of the company. ""We  will look back at those stories and will be proud that we got over  them,"" he continued.According to Mason, with 40 million active customers, Groupon is  trying to do what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has done for products, but with local  businesses. On the other hand, goods deals are a way to take what the  company has learned from local deals and apply it to goods.This year, Groupon's stock has been drastically down. It was trading  at over $24 and is now trading at exactly $4.00 a share. Mason said that  Groupon is optimizing the stock for three or four years.Most of the interview was about how the press reports on Groupon's  activities. He said that many articles ""countered each other"" and don't  depict the reality. International growth and goods deals have surprised  the company.Finally, Mason reiterated that he is the right guy for the job. ""If I  thought I wasn't the guy, I would be the first person to stand up,"" he  said. ""I think we have the strategy, I think we have the team and the  board sees that,"" he continued.Original Post"
1015631,28831,2012-11-17T11:31:19-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) announced its quarterly earnings on November 8. As of the time of this writing the stock is down roughly 30% from its pre-earnings release levels. The magnitude of the decline may come as a surprise to those who do not look into the numbers in detail. After all, the company met expectations on non-GAAP earnings, and only missed revenue forecasts by less than 4%.I have been following coverage of the post-earnings drop in the press and online. To my surprise, in almost all of the articles I have read, including a few here on Seeking Alpha, the price drop of the stock has been attributed to either slowing revenue growth or to the company's struggling international business. While these are contributing factors, I believe the massive drop in share price is due to something else entirely. The real reason is that Groupon's third party revenue declined substantially quarter over quarter.Total third party revenues declined by $79.4M, or 16% from prior quarter. The company does not break out its third party revenues geographically. However, given that total international revenues only fell by $31.2M quarter-on-quarter, it is hard to picture a scenario where at least some of the declines in third party revenues did not come from North America.""Third Party"" Revenue And Its ImportanceGroupon divides its revenues in two categories: ""third party"" and ""direct.""Third party revenue is derived from activities in which Groupon acts as an agent for a merchant, and sells their services or products on its platform. When acting as an agent, Groupon does not take title to any products, and has no inventory risk and little working capital requirements. Third party revenues are principally associated with the daily deals business.Direct revenues on the other hand are associated with selling products that Groupon is ultimately responsible for. In other words, Groupon sells goods that it owns, and will be responsible for defects, damages and returns. Most of the revenues generated from Groupon Goods are in the form of direct revenues.The gross margin profiles of the two lines of business are vastly different. As an example, Groupon enjoyed an 87% gross margin on its third party business, but earned a mere 12% gross margin on the direct business. This means, holding all else equal, Groupon needs to replace every $1 of lost sales in its third party business (read daily deals) with more than $7 of sales in direct sales to generate the same gross profits.The Bear Case StrengthensPerhaps more damaging to the share price than the shrinking gross margins explained above is the ammo that this last quarterly report gives for the bears. For many months now the bears have argued that Groupon's daily deals business model is not sustainable. The main points of their argument are deal fatigue, competition, merchant dissatisfaction, and lack of repeat business for merchants. I am sure they will not hesitate to use last quarter's shrinking daily deals business as proof for their argument. To be honest, Groupon hasn't made it an easy task to counter the bears.A Note on Cash BalanceMany people suggest that Groupon's $1.2B in cash and with no long-term debt provides a major support for the stock. This is not the case. Most of the cash on Groupon's books is offset by its obligations towards merchant partners and other current liabilities. Groupon's current assets (including cash) only exceed its current liabilities by approximately $300M. Therefore, if you decide to invest in Groupon it should not be because of the safety cushion the cash position provides.Going ForwardI take the decline in third party revenues seriously. For now, I will be holding on to my small speculative long position on the basis of reasons I outlined in my previous article on Groupon. However, going forward I have to see progress in growing or stabilizing the daily deals business, or meaningful uptake in Groupon's other businesses in order to stay a shareholder.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

1009951,24480,2012-11-15T05:32:43-05:00,,"Here's an anniversary story for you: Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) went public one year ago, with great fanfare and a last-minute price hike to $20 per share. It was the biggest Internet IPO since Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) in 2004. On Monday, Groupon closed at $2.66 a share. With luck, it might survive into the new year.In an effort to increase its chances of survival, Groupon just announced a free shipping offer through the holidays on most of its Groupon Goods. It even rolled out its first-ever holiday catalog.Groupon Goods is the newer division that sells deeply discounted products. Investors don't like it any more than they like Groupon's core business, selling coupons online for local businesses. It's lower margin, since they manage the inventory in-house. And it's got better-established competition with vastly larger inventory, like Overstock (NASDAQ: OSTK) and Half.com, owned by eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).What went wrong at the world's ""fastest-growing company"" (at least according to Forbes) ever? Nothing that wasn't obvious a year ago. Sure, it was growing fast, with a ""marketing reach"" of 150 million people. It also was losing money, its revenue growth was flat, and neither of those facts was adequately disguised by some truly squirrely accounting practices.In fact, some of its accounting is still a tad squirrelly. The Wall Street Journal points out that Groupon has a respectable $1.2 billion in cash, but half of that is money owed to merchants but not yet paid out.Worst of all, the local merchants who were the drivers of its business were running like bunnies. They were telling horror stories about mobs of bargain-hunters who bought the loss leaders and never came back. These weren't big operators, they were mom-and-pop shops, like the British cupcake baker who wound up selling 102,000 cupcakes at a loss.Still, Groupon was trying to make ""local"" work, and ""local"" is the Holy Grail of the Internet. Local information, local services, local news and coupons and advertising. Such an alluring idea, and nearly impossible to implement.Nearly impossible because of its high people costs. It takes a lot of people to go door to door, from pizza parlor to dentist to dog groomer, peddling coupon offers. Groupon was trying to do that on a worldwide basis.The latest sign that this was not a good idea came only last week, when Groupon announced its quarterly results. Superficially, a lot of the numbers looked good. Revenues were up more than 80%, to $292 million, for the US and Canada. Europe was a disaster area; no surprise there.But the company still lost about $3 million in the quarter, and its net profit for the first nine months of 2012 was just $13.7 million. For the year as a whole, it expects to break even.So, can this company be saved? Surprisingly, the answer is maybe.Groupon is working on automating the process of implementing its coupon business. It's also clearly working on its tools for merchants, including a new payment app as well as marketing and bookkeeping services. These don't have much to do with coupons, but they could keep plenty of small merchants in the Groupon loop.Another interesting twist is its acquisition of Savored, a New York-based startup that helps restaurants fill tables by offering discounts for reservations at non-peak hours.Put it all together, and it starts adding up to a strategy. It might have been a good idea to get all that stuff in place before it expanded. But it looks like it's now or never for Groupon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1026761,38211,2012-11-25T08:42:55-05:00,,"The past 6 market days have accumulated to a 45% increase in Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock price. This is a large move that cannot just be explained by fluctuations in the market. The events that are supposedly responsible for this include: large stock purchases by ""smart money"", a stock rebound after hitting a 52 week low after 3Q 2012 earnings call on November 9th, Groupon's opening of a 4K square foot ""concept store"" in Hong Kong, and the notorious short squeeze.Reason 1# Smart MoneyOn the, so to speak, smart money note, Tiger Global has recently taken a 9.9% stake in Groupon. The hedge fund purchased 65 million shares in Groupon. At Friday's close of $3.95, that stake was valued at $320 million. The news comes a week after George Soros and Paul Tudor Jones disclosed their recent purchases of Groupon's stock in Q3. A lot of ""smart money"" has been poured into a company that's dealing with some serious challenges. Tiger Global is not backed by a good history of large purchases in the Internet Sector, in the past it has taken large stakes in Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which have decreased significantly since their purchase price.Reason #2 Bounce on 52 Week LowSince Groupon's IPO, the stock has fallen 85%. Recently, the downward trend has picked up pace falling from roughly $8 in August to a low of $2.60 on November 12th. Traders have been looking for this trend to hit resistance in order to catch the upside on the famous bounce on the 52 week low. The three days after the response to the 3Q 2012 earnings call the stock price barely moved up or down, hitting a significant amount of resistance. Right after this three day period of the stock resisting to fall lower, the stock shot up drastically over the next few days, resulting in a bounce on the 52 week low.Reason #3 Concept StoreEarlier last week Groupon opened a 4K square foot ""concept store"" in Hong Kong it says will allow visitors to ""experience the Groupon lifestyle"" and pick up products purchased on Groupon's site. This can be seen as a desperate measure by the company as changes to its online infrastructure to a land based one which has proven futile by the retailers like BestBuy (NYSE:BBY) in the past year. Another desperate example is Groupon's ""always-on"" deals that have no end date. The deals, initially available in New York City and Chicago and totaling 27K can be browsed and searched for on Groupon's site.Reason #4 Short SqueezeThis past May, there was a short squeeze when there where over 25 million shares shorted that prompted more than a 50% gain in just two trading days as the stock traded as high as $14.93 per share up from $9.70. Currently, Groupon's short interest has surged to the highest level in the company's history - with over 36 million shares sold short. This number was based on the short interest as of the close of trading on October 31st. Since the earnings call on November 9th the stock has jumped nearly 45%, which could be due to the short sellers covering themselves and rallying a short squeeze. If this is the case this inflation would be a false presentation of the company's value and thus would make the Groupon a good short in the options market as another short squeeze could potentially hurt the small investor as he/she will be forced to cover.Groupon Poised on Downhill SlopeIn the past earnings report, Groupon missed revenue forecasts by less than 4%. But, total third party revenues declined by $79.4M, or 16% from prior quarter. Additionally, some people suggest that Groupon's $1.2B in cash and no long-term debt provides a major support for the stock. Rather, the majority of the cash on Groupon's books is offset by its obligations towards merchant partners. Groupon's current assets only exceed its current liabilities by roughly $280 million. Further, Groupon's core business has been challenged by a host of competitors pushing their way into the new industry of providing daily online coupons for goods and services, such as rival LivingSocial. Lately, the company has tried a list of other money-making operations, but unfortunately none seem able to give Groupon its turnaround story it so desperately is looking for.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

1037901,36991,2012-11-30T09:44:04-05:00,,"Reasonable people will disagree on what prices make a sound investment, which is why there's a stock market. Take busted IPO Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), which at the time of this writing (late afternoon, November 29, 2012) still has its 32-year old founder Andrew Mason in the CEO role. The company's website shows that the Groupon Investor Kit, which usually provides a briefing for potential investors, is unavailable, perhaps raising questions about potential changes in top leadership.Groupon's fall from investor grace shows that, regardless of new business models, valuation still matters and highlights the danger of investors being swept away in enthusiasm over the next big thing. It also illustrates that it is important to examine market expectations and how reasonable they appear.Below is the chart history of the stock price of Groupon (blue-grey mountain chart) and the Thomson Reuters StarMine Intrinsic Valuation (dividend discount) Model value (blue line) for Groupon since its inception.The recent $4.54 price is now closer to Thomson Reuters StarMine's Intrinsic Valuation Model calculation of $3.95. That's after adjusting for three identifiable analyst biases (high growth stocks have their growth rates overestimated, overestimating longer term growth rates as compared to shorter term growth rates, and failure to fully account for reversion to the mean in growth rates and return on equity).What would get the stock price much higher? If the company were able to grow earnings by 40% a year over the next four years, then the intrinsic value would move to $23.15.On a less enthusiastic basis, a 20% growth rate over the next four years results in an intrinsic value of Groupon stock at $6.02, which is only 32% above the current price. By way of comparison, the current StarMine SmartGrowth rate for Groupon is 26% for next year and 13% for the following three years. That's not the type of risk/reward many investors may want to take on, based on current valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1014701,24491,2012-11-16T15:38:56-05:00,,"Once again, online deals retailer Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) missed the mark when it reported third-quarter results earlier this month. Revenue fell slightly short of expectations, growing 32% year over year to $568.6 million. The firm's loss shrank to $2.9 million, or breakeven on a per share basis, which was short of consensus estimates calling for a profit of $0.03.Roughly 80% revenue expansion in North America was overshadowed by weak 3% international growth. Furthermore, third-party and other revenue was flat year over year at $423.5 million. All of Groupon's growth came from Groupon Goods, as Direct Revenue increased significantly year over year to $144.9 million and doubled quarter over quarter. However, we're not too bullish on this dramatic shift. Gross margins in the Groupon Goods business totaled 12%, compared to 87% for the deals business.Although this may require less SG&A spending, the space is incredibly competitive and is cluttered with other clearance sites such as Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) and even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). While the online deal space is certainly cooling off, we don't like the firm's decision to battle head to head with other established giants in a low-margin business. In fact, the weakness from LivingSocial and the death of other startup coupon companies could allow Groupon to become the sole leader in the space.International revenue grew just 3% to $276.9 million, and gross billing (total amount of goods sold) fell off a cliff, down 12% year over year. The firm's international business is European, and with seemingly all of the European Union flirting with recession, we expect this segment to experience prolonged weakness.Still, the company remains relatively well-capitalized for the time being, and continues to generate some cash. Free cash flow during the third quarter was $26 million -- down substantially from a year ago, but still positive. Headcount was up year over year, but fell by over 800 employees sequentially, which is a positive for cost containment, in our view. Active customers also ticked up 4% sequentially to 39.5 million, likely benefiting from the expansion of Groupon Goods.Liquidity remains fine, in our view. Recent market performance suggests bankruptcy may not be too far off, but we don't think that's the case. Revenue, albeit at a lower margin, continues to grow and the company has ample liquidity to survive (at least for now). Plus, we think headcount could absorb further reductions without materially impacting the top line. The company has $1.2 billion in cash vs. $879 million in accrued expenses and payables. Of course, this could change quickly, especially if revenue from third parties continues to stagnate.Groupon continues to hold an interesting position as the largest online coupon marketplace, but the brand has lost some of its luster and its current transformation is questionable, in our view. We're not at all interested in shares at this level, and we think liquidity could become a problem in mid-2013 if cash flow doesn't improve.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1000561,25120,2012-11-12T13:50:56-05:00,,"Shares of Groupon (GRPN) lost another 30% of their value on Friday. On Thursday after the market close, the e-commerce market place reported its third quarter results.Third Quarter ResultsGroupon reported third quarter revenues of $568.6 million, up 32.2% on the year. Revenues fell short of the company's own guidance of $580 to $620 million. Analysts expected Groupon to report revenues of $590.1 million.Worrisome is that revenue growth has stabilized on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Gross billings came in at $1.22 billion over the quarter, up 5% on the year. In constant currencies, revenues were up by 11%. Revenues stopped growing as Groupon aggressively cut marketing expenses to ""just"" 12% of revenues.The company reported an operating income of $25.4 million compared to a loss of $0.2 million last year. Operating income came in at the midpoint of the company's own guidance of $15-$35 million. Operating income fell from $46 million in the second quarter.Net losses narrowed from $54.2 million to $3.0 million, or $0.00 per diluted share after rounding. Analysts expected the company to earn $0.03 for the quarter.Detailed InformationGroupon had a solid performance in North America. Revenues were up 80.5% to $291.6 million for the quarter, as growth is accelerating compared to the 73.6% growth rate for the first nine months of the year.International performance was very bad. Revenues rose a mere 3.1% during the quarter to $277.0 million, or 12.7% in constant currencies. To put the growth rate into perspective, revenue growth for the first nine months came in at 51.7%. Furthermore, revenues fell 10% compared to the second quarter.OutlookFor the fourth quarter, Groupon guided for revenues of $625 to $675 million. The company expects operating income to come in between zero and $20 million, with stock based compensation expenses estimated at $30 million.The midpoint of Groupon's revenue guidance beat analysts estimates of $634 million. Non-GAAP operating income which is guided at $30-$50 million fell short of analyst expectations of $62 million.ValuationGroupon ended its third quarter with $1.20 billion in cash and equivalents. The company does not operate with debt for a comfortable net cash position.For the first nine months of 2012, Groupon reported revenues of $1.70 billion. The company reported a modest net profit of $13.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.After Friday's 30% decline, the market values Groupon at merely $1.8 billion. This values the firm's operating assets at just $600 million. As such, operating assets are valued at merely 0.25 times annual revenues. The company is expected to roughly break even for the year.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Groupon have lost almost 90%. Shares started the year at $20 and peaked at $24 in February. From that point in time shares kept sliding to a mere $2.76 at the moment.Groupon aggressively grew its revenues from $313 million in 2010 to an estimated $2.35 billion in 2012. The company reported a net loss of $390 million in 2010 and could break even this year.Investors who invested at time of the public offering are not too happy, with shares down some 86%. The company has been plagued with accounting worries, angry customers and merchants, a poor performance in Europe, and competition from LivingSocial backed by Amazon.com (AMZN).To combat the decline in revenue growth Groupon has decided to sell goods as well, expected to generate sales of $500 million per annum. The poor performance in Europe is attributed to poor management and general economic worries. Groupon hopes that by investing in technology, innovation, customer relations and personalized deals, it will be able to revamp the European business.With shares valued at merely $1.8 billion, operating assets are valued at little over $1 per share if management does not squander its cash balances. Before the public offering, Google (GOOG) offered $6 billion for the operating assets of the firm, implying a valuation of roughly $10 per share.Just like some of its featured deals. Perhaps the IPO price was too expensive, yet a 86% discount should attract some buyers.I am a speculative buyer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours.

997921,22445,2012-11-11T02:31:22-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is one of those stocks, which for some odd reason, had an IPO priced for pie in the sky. I can never understand what investors expect from a stock that trades at a Price/Sales ratio of over 10.The stock plunged on Friday, when it announced Q3 results and missed estimates. The question is, is the market over reacting? Was this miss all that important in determining the value of this stock? And if so, is this a good opportunity?To start with, lets look at some key statistics and valuation metrics after this drop. Current market cap, $1.8 billion, Price/Sales 1.25, Price/Book 3.28, Total cash $1,2 billion and total cash per share $1.85.So on valuation metrics alone, this stock has nothing to do with the bubble valuation after its IPO. These are actually valuation metrics I can deal with and buy under certain circumstances.Revenues as well as active subscribers for Q3 were sub par, and this is probably the reason investors were worried. Active subscribers for Q3 2012 were 39.5 million and were up only by 1.5 million from Q2 2012. And while total subscribers hover around 200 million, the money is made by the active subscribers. So either these subscribers use some other coupon service or they simply don't use anything at all.Total revenue for the group has not changed much for the first 9 months of 2012. Q1 revenue was $559 million, Q2 $568 million and Q3 $569 million. And the reason for this sub par growth, probably has to do with the competition in the space.While Groupon is probably the most known company in the space, it is not the only one. There are dozens if not hundreds of companies operating in the U.S. alone. Among them Gilt City, Saveology, Greater Good, Plum District and most notable LivingSocial, Google Offers and niche players like TravelZoo and Bloomspot.Something else notable is the fact that the company is gaining in North America and actually losing revenue from its international operations. Q1 2012 international sales were $321 million, Q2 $308 million and Q3 $277 million. Again, I think competition has a lot to do with this, besides the problems that the company has with their international operations as mentioned on their conference call.For example in Greece alone, there are dozens of small companies that offer coupons on everything you can imagine. The spam coupons I get in my email on a daily basis has become really annoying. I assume Groupon still has a good portion of the market in Greece, but I also assume that it's not what it use to be. More than likely, business is down from a year ago, due to this competition.That of course also means that the company can no longer command the once high-flying multiple it had. The market has already done this for us and multiple firms on Friday downgraded the company. William Blair downgraded Groupon from Outperform to Market Perform. Evercore Partners analyst Ken Sena slashed his price target on Groupon from $3 to $2 after Friday's close.The firm reduced 2013 EBITDA estimate for Groupon from $260 million to $176 million on the expectation for higher COGS from 1P Goods and slower growth from higher margin Daily Deals.GRPN Market Cap data by YChartsGRPN Net Income Quarterly data by YChartsThe company provided a better outlook for margins, saying margins will increase, as Groupon streamlines its international business. That will improve margins and profits overall for the whole group, said the company.The company is also offering a new product, whereby instead of getting email of different offers, you would search for what you want in your geographical area. These tests are being conducted in New York and Chicago and the company says that they are very excited about this new offering.ConclusionValuation of Groupon has come down a lot., However I would not say that I am ready to buy this stock as of yet. A 30% one day drop usually means (from my experience) that the stock has further downside to go.Having said that however, I like the business model of the company and the way management is adapting to change, for example offering a different product mix as described above (listen here to the company's conference call).I also think this is a very solid company and the coupon business is not going away anytime soon. While it may just be that competition is a reason why their revenue has been flat over the past three quarters, at the same time however, I also think that this company is much better positioned than anybody else to do a better job in this business and produce growth and earnings for shareholders in the future.Most importantly, the company is also within the valuation metrics of what I would pay for it. As such, I will wait a while for the dust to settle after Friday's drop, and see if this stock is going further south (as I think it will) before deciding to make a move.I you are looking to buy this stock as a longer-term investment and not simply interested in trading it, I would wait a little to get more feedback from the company's next quarterly report. However, if you see indications of technical strength on the charts, I would buy it anywhere south of here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1009551,34211,2012-11-15T02:26:44-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has continued its quick fall to the bottom this year as it has now lost over $20 on its share price and sits below the $3 mark. For many, this outcome has been long expected, as Groupon's fundamentals leave much to be desired. For the company to return to relevance it is pinning its hopes on becoming the ""operating system of local commerce"", although personally, I'm weary about its ability to make this move. Expect Groupon to find its equilibrium in a substantially smaller market capitalization with lower profitability.First among the poor fundamentals is Groupon's bloated staff. Currently, it employs almost 11,500 employees. To be fair, the number of employees itself is a poor metric of success or failure, but the fact that Groupon's business relies on salespeople to push daily deals with little in the way of automation, signals that the company has little in the way of resilience. One point is that while the company continues to employ a substantial sales force, year on year sales are down about $430 million.Much to its credit, the company is now beginning to use technology to replace and increase the productivity of its sales force. However, it recently cut only about 80 sales jobs, which is likely too low to make any significant difference.But one should also question Groupon's main source of revenue: daily deals. The fact that it intends to pivot so drastically into becoming the operating system of local commerce is a negative indicator to investors. Established companies rarely pull off a successful pivot and it remains to be seen whether Groupon is an innovative enough company to pull it off. True, it did make one great innovation and that has kickstarted its progress, but it has failed to keep that innovation to itself. The market has been flooded with other companies offering the same deals as Groupon does. The transition away from this core service will be difficult, as will keeping others from following suit. Making the task even more difficult is the fact that Groupon has never been an impressive technological company so entering the software market is a larger change than most people might believe.But the fact that daily deals are a fad that has failed to deliver is apparent to most and is the main reason that its revenue fell below both analysts' expectations and the company's own guidance.Specifically, the company earned about $568 million in revenue, a lower than expected number which the company chalks up to economic sluggishness in Europe. Personally, I think that is far too rosy eyed. As I mentioned, revenue is down over $400 million and Groupon's European problem is certainly not the singular cause of that drop.However, even despite these shortcomings, few analysts rate Groupon as a sell. Among 25 analysts, only three believe that Groupon is a sell, with seventeen rating it as a hold. This surprises me since the company's revenue streams are highly volatile and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight for the European crisis, suggesting its problem there will not improve anytime soon.Additionally, the average price target for Groupon is about $7, which is still $13 below its January price. Having said that, current investors would be ecstatic if the price increased to $7.But, as I mentioned earlier there are reasons to be bullish. The market for local commerce is huge and it remains an open market with just a few big names. Current players like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Foursquare are increasing their position in local commerce but have anything but a hold on these markets. Also, these companies are vying for a different segment of these markets and won't pose a threat if Groupon successfully implements its operating system.And the company has taken some good steps towards creating this operating system. Just recently it acquired the point of sale company Breadcrumb and restaurant reservation company Savored. These are fantastic acquisitions that position the company as a service provider which should stabilize its revenues. It will be much easier to convince businesses that these services are value-added than Groupon's base service.To be sure though, any entrance into the point of sale market faces stiff competition as services offered by Square continue to dominate. In fact, for the acquisition of Savored to work I think that it will need to be tied in to a slew of other services. Being second place in this particular market is a terrible position to be in.Overall, I can't say that Groupon is a solid investment - even if it's able to hit a target price of $7, it'd be hard to stay propped up there with coupons chipping away at its market share. This is a highly risky stock that equally has potential to reinvent itself or fade into irrelevance. Much of this stock's riskiness comes from whether you believe in its new path or not. Truthfully, I think Groupon waited too long - and stayed too stubbornly attached to its core product before it realized it needed this pivot. And either way, the turnaround will not be quick and it will not be easy. Stay away for now - Groupon hasn't gotten good enough sails to keep its ship from sinking.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was prepared for Freedonia Freelance by one of our analysts."
978661,24631,2012-11-05T11:57:31-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reports fiscal Q3 results on November 8th.The Street expects:In Q2, Groupon reported a weaker than expected quarter in which billing, revenue and active customers all came in below consensus. The only bright spots were take rate and CSOI that came in slightly ahead of consensus. The weakness in Q2 was due to a combination of changing consumer behavior, European weakness and FX headwind. Management guided this upcoming quarter below consensus.In the near-term, I believe Groupon will continue to face increasing headwind given its recent staff turnover, increasing competition and soft industry sales.In August, Groupon lost Lee Brown and Jayna Cooke, two key sales personnel, amid increasing decline of its sales force. I note that Groupon's sales force shrank to 5,587 people in Q2 from 5,735 in Q1. The 75% stock price decline since the company's IPO is adding additional challenges to staff retention. The declining stock option value is making the company increasingly less appealing to the employees who are becoming unconfident about the company's future prospect.Aside from the low barriers to entry of the group-buying industry, Groupon is also facing competitive pressure from well-funded internet peers, namely Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which owns 29% of LivingSocial, Groupon's largest direct competitor. Amazon's daily deal business, AmazonLocal, recently began to offer daily deals by YP.com, which may disrupt Groupon's competitive positioning in the daily deals space.Finally, the industry sales trend is unlikely to pick up in the near-term given the continued weak macro environment and softness in Europe.Despite near-term uncertainties, investors should also note the recent steps that the company took to strengthen its long-term position:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

998241,20991,2012-11-11T05:58:26-05:00,,"Last year, when Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) went public, I entered into a ""small wager"" with Rocky Agrawal. We would check back on Groupon's market valuation in one year's time, and compare it to the valuation of Priceline (PCLN). At the IPO, Groupon's market capitalization was 72% that of Priceline; if that number fell below 30%, I would lose. Otherwise, I would win.Well, here's what happened to that ratio:This actually understates how badly I lost the bet. Shortly after the bet expired, two things happened: Priceline announced that it was buying Kayak (NASDAQ:KYAK), and Groupon plunged on disappointing third-quarter earnings. Friday, Groupon closed at $2.76 per share, giving it a market capitalization of $1.8 billion. Priceline, by contrast, closed at $625.87; if you add its capitalization to that of Kayak, you get a total of $32.74 billion. Which means that the Groupon:Priceline ratio is basically down to about 5.5%.Obviously, something went horribly wrong at Groupon after the IPO. So, what was it? Did Groupon suffer a massive loss in revenues? Did it start racking up enormous losses? Well, here's the chart.The blue bars, here, are Groupon's quarterly revenues, from the second quarter of 2010 onwards. The red bars are its net income. And the jagged line, of course, its its plunging share price.The main thing to note is that Groupon's results don't seem particularly gruesome; they're certainly better now than they were when the company went public. The share price didn't fall because revenues were falling: it fell because revenues - and profits - weren't rising fast enough.This is why I'm generally so mistrustful of stocks: they just don't behave in a remotely predictable manner. It's impossible to know what kind of future growth rate is priced in to a stock, and it's even more impossible to have a good grasp of what a company's future growth will be. If you're valuing fast-growing companies on some kind of discounted cash-flow model, then tiny tweaks to your growth assumptions or your discount rates can have an enormous effect on the share price which pops out the other end.I knew this, of course, when I entered into my bet with Rocky. So what was I thinking? Three things.Firstly, volatility cuts both ways. Groupon could fall precipitously - but it could rise very fast as well, in which case I'd be well in the money.Secondly, I was already well in the money: Groupon stock could fall in half and I'd still win the bet. I don't believe in the efficient market hypothesis, but I do believe that the markets are more efficient than any individual. Given the cushion that Rocky was offering me, I'll take the side of the market against anybody.Finally, the kind of things which hurt one bubbly tech stock tend to hurt them all. When we entered into the bet, Priceline had risen from just over $50 per share in the fall of 2008 to more than $500 per share in the fall of 2011. Rocky's bet wasn't just that the Groupon bubble would bust: it was that the Groupon bubble would burst and the Priceline bubble wouldn't. Which, of course, turns out to have been exactly what happened: it wasn't long before Priceline was trading at more than $750.So, next time we're in the same city, I'm buying Rocky dinner. At least I'm still winning the other bet, for the same stakes.Disclosure: No positions"
1038201,39081,2012-11-30T12:04:20-05:00,,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) 80 percent IPO loss is quite a decline in this day and age. However if you look back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, it happened everywhere in the internet sector. A lot people consider Groupon as a doomed company that will eventually go bankrupt. At the same time, Groupon did not do enough to prove these people wrong, especially when Q3 results came out.The 9.9% share purchase by Tiger Global was a vote of confidence. However, I do not think investors should consider this as the signal to initiate a long position in Groupon . If management does not have extraordinary plans to change business strategy, and things stay the same in the next few quarters, the company will likely continue its downward trend.On one hand, we see a company lost close to 90% value from its peak. On the other hand, we also see a great risk/reward opportunity here. In my experience, there were a few opportunities similar to Groupon's, and they paid off nicely to people who invested in them. Off the top of my head, there are Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) and Bank Of Ireland (NYSE:IRE). In 2009, Las Vegas Sands almost went bankrupt due to solvency problems caused by accounting issues. Its share price went as low as $1.38. However, the company survived and is now priced around $45. The other one is Bank Of Ireland which lost 99% of its market capitalization to $0.66 per share. In only a few months, IRE recovered to $20. I am fully aware that Groupon, Las Vegas Sands, and Bank of Ireland are different companies in different sectors and Groupon's situation is different from LVS and IRE. The one similarity is that, at one point, a lot people thought these companies would go bankrupt, but they survived and paid nice returns.Sure, the forward P/E works well for most companies, but Groupon is not like most companies. It is one of its kind, and it was analyzed with too much speculative growth and future revenue. For a company like Groupon, use the easiest analysis to calculate the entry points may work the best.I would start to consider purchasing shares or options when Groupon share price enters into these range below.1) One entry point is based on Groupon's current asset: Current Asset/share=$1.432B/655M=$2.19.2) One billion dollars market capital entry point:$1 billion Market Cap/Share=$1B/655M=$1.53.3) Unrealistic but possible entry point is working capital entry: (Current Asset- Current Liability)/Share=(1.432B-1.125B)/655M=$0.46. Entry point $0.46-0.55. At this point, I would not even touch the stock unless I want to gamble on a possible short term bounce for some quick money. A better way to gamble is just take that money to a casino to play roulette.4) My entry point is (Total Asset- Current Liability)/share=($2.033B-1.125B)/655M=$1.37. Counting into the momentum factor and resistance factor, entry point is between $1.30-1.50. An overall 95% price decline from Groupon's all time high.I would buy call options that have long expiration, such as January 2014, January 2015 out of the money Calls. If the share price is low enough, I would buy the actual shares to avoid the time limitation on the calls.A good investor is the one with discipline. Groupon may never go as low as the prices stated above. However, if an opportunity presents, I will not hesitate to initiate a long position within my price range. It is only because the possible payoff is far greater than the risk ... if it does pay off.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

904731,35301,2012-10-04T11:52:32-04:00,,"Since its IPO, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) hasn't given investors much to be excited about. The stock price has reflected that disappointment, as it has fallen from above $26 per share to the mid $4 range. Factors seem to indicate that Groupon's stock might now be turning around.Over the last few years, Groupon has impressed investors in two main ways: its incredible growth rate and its astronomical losses. Revenue grew 415% from 2010 to 2011 to an astonishing $1.6 billion last year. However, at the same time, Groupon had an operating margin of negative 134% in 2010 and maintained a loss in 2011 despite the huge growth in revenue.But things are looking positive for Groupon. Its loss in 2011 was only 14%, not 134%, and it has now posted decent results for three straight quarters. The fourth quarter of 2011, it had operating income of $8 million. In the first quarter of 2012. that increased to $68 million. Q2 operating income increased as well. up to $72 million. These Q2 numbers disappointed many investors when they were released back in August because investors had expected higher growth. The stock took a serious beating over the next several weeks and hasn't recovered since.Nevertheless, this pattern of growth indicates that Groupon could very well end this year posting its first annual profit as a publicly traded company. This would be great news for the stock. So, will Groupon continue to maintain its profitability? Here are a few reasons that indicate that it will.First of all, analysts seem to think so, as the earnings estimates for both Q3 and Q4 are positive: a vast improvement from the negative territory where they resided last year.On top of that, Groupon has made some strategic moves to better position itself for profitable growth. First it acquired Savored, a competitor company based out of NYC that caters to high end restaurants that were afraid they might lose money through a Groupon deal. This site is slightly different from Groupon in two ways. The discounts from Savored tend to be smaller than typical Groupon deals (30-40% rather than 75-80%). Also, this site is focused not so much on having restaurants run deals to get customers in the door, but on restaurants offering up empty tables for patrons to reserve. Many of the high end restaurants on the site offer deals only on off days. This seems like a good acquisition, as it relieves some of the worry merchants have with using Groupon due to the possibility of losing money on the deal if customers don't return. Groupon will now have the ability to provide deals that are more tailored to the merchant.Groupon already has a large network of businesses it works with, and it has been developing various services to improve the value proposition for merchants considering using Groupon. These include online scheduling software and rewards programs. A recent addition is Groupon's new merchant processing system, which allows business owners to process credit cards on an iPhone through Groupon. Groupon offers what it touts as the lowest fee anywhere at 1.8% plus a 15 cent transaction fee. The idea is to give merchants another reason to work with Groupon. The new merchant processing app will also allow merchants to scan Groupons and track the impact and customer spend for each deal.While recent growth and expectations might be positive, there are still definitely concerns regarding Groupon. First of all, while Groupon had an operating profit in the first quarter of 2012, it still ended up with a net loss of $3.6 million that quarter. Additionally, while most investors are looking for a growing profitable company, Groupon is much more interested in just growing. As written in its Q2 report:Groupon's biggest expense historically has been marketing. In the first quarter of 2011, it spent $230 million on marketing and spent $220 million in the second quarter. As Groupon develops more of a foothold both nationally and internationally, this expense will diminish. We are already beginning to witness this. The combined marketing expense from Q1 and Q2 of 2012 was only $204 million.Groupon will continue to invest huge amounts of money in growth, but it seems to be entering an era of profitability where it will begin to recoup the huge losses it has incurred thus far. This seems like an ideal time to purchase this stock in anticipation of continued growth and profitability.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

996351,25106,2012-11-09T16:34:24-05:00,,"On Friday, shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) fell sharply to a new all-time low following an earnings miss reported on Thursday. As shown by the chart below, GRPN shares are now down more than 70% since I recommended that investors avoid shares in my article titled ""Groupon Hits New All-Time Low: What You Need To Know."" Now, with shares trading below $3 per share, I think GRPN is an interesting speculative long.Here's a look at the earnings highlights:Clearly, judging by the nearly 30% decline in GRPN shares following the results, it is safe to say that Wall Street was disappointed with the results. On the conference call, GRPN CEO Andrew Mason blamed the weak results on the international segment. In addition to discussing the weakness in the international segment, Mason also discussed the changing distribution channels for GRPN:Bet on Andrew Mason?Simply put, since GRPN's IPO at $20 per share a year ago, things have been disastrous for the company. One of the major setbacks for GRPN has been the rise of stiff competition in many of its markets, notably Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Deals and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers. However, it must be noted that Andrew Mason was the visionary behind the online deals market. While it has not paid to bet on Andrew Mason so far, I think it is naive to say that a turnaround is impossible given what he has already accomplished in a short period of time with GRPN. In just four years, Mason has grown GRPN into a company generating more than $500 million in sales. Certainly, there are problems with GRPN's business right now but I believe Mason is capable of doing what is needed to get GRPN back on track. Mason still owns more than 45 million shares of GRPN, so he certainly still has a personal stake in the success of GRPN.Cash Per ShareCurrently, GRPN has more than $1 billion or $1.82 per share in cash and no debt. With the stock trading below $3, I believe the cash per share could serve as something of a cushion for the stock. When the stock was trading at higher levels, the cash per share was not as relevant. GRPN's strong financial position means that the risk of an extreme adverse event such as bankruptcy is quite low since the company currently has no debt and plenty of cash to finance its operations as needed.Takeover CandidatePrior to going public, Google made a takeover bid for GRPN worth $6 billion. Now, with GRPN valued at less than $2 billion a takeover is certainly possible. Of course, speculating on a takeover is always risky but there are many potential buyers including Google, Amazon, Yahoo (YHOO), and others.Short InterestAs of Oct. 15, when short interest was last reported, more than 32 million shares or 15.5% of the float was sold short. With the stock now trading at an all-time low, I think it is far to late to short the stock. To me, given the floor at $1.82 because of the cash per share, the risk of a buyout or turnaround is far greater than the potential downside. I expect short sellers to realize this and begin to take some gains at these levels. Short covering could lead to a short-term turn in the stock.ConclusionWhile I still remain skeptical of GRPN's business model, I believe it is an interesting speculation under $3. The cash per share, potential takeover, short interest, and possibility of an Andrew Mason led turnaround are all reasons why GRPN shares are likely close to a bottom.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

919131,29461,2012-10-11T14:32:35-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has faced investors' wrath over the last year. After the magical IPO, GRPN plunged to $5-$6, shedding 80% of its IPO value. The company reported an increase in revenues from $312 million to $1.6 billion between 2010 and 2011. Investors are not complaining about revenue growth, but rather about continued losses due to minuscule margins. We believe the company is finally turning a corner, and current valuations (14x P/E) are on the lower side. Therefore, we believe the stock is underpriced and are giving a buy rating for GRPN.Earning History:GRPN is a very good example of investors overreacting due to missed expectations. We believe Wall Street was not justified in valuing GRPN at $25 apiece; however, a P/E of 14x for a business with immense growth potential is also not justified. The table below reveals that the company exceeded analyst expectations in the last quarter.Source: Yahoo FinanceFundamental:The table below shows that the company has shown a consistent revenue growth over the last three years. Revenues have grown by approximately 1.6% QoQ, according to last quarter's results.Source: ReutersThe EPS figures also showed a steady increase in the last three quarters. This is an even more encouraging figure for investors, as the primary concern with GRPN has always been its low margins.Source: ReutersThe increase in margins remains the key to the long term success of GRPN. The company has an EBITD margin of 5.45% and a gross margin of ~80%. The operating margin, however, is almost 50% less than the industry average of 5.03%. The net profit margin is negative, which is why analysts have gone to the extent of calling GRPN a Ponzi scheme. We believe these margins should improve in the long run, as the company improves its ecosystem by offering incentives for partners. These incentives include offers such as Groupon Payments, and the recently launched Breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs is a POS facility for retailers, starting at $99 a month and offering 24/7 technical support. The biggest item in the income statement, which eats away its revenues, is selling/general/admin expense. In 2011, these expenses formed 98% of the company's total revenues. However, if we compare the last two quarters, revenues have increased by 1.5%, whereas selling/general/admin expenses have gone down by 3%. The most significant decrease has been in marketing expenses, which have decreased by more than 60% in the last quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year.Source: ReutersConclusion:We believe investors should expect growth in revenues to continue, as incentives such as Groupon Payments and Breadcrumbs pull retailers into the company's ecosystem. The main culprits eating away the profit are selling and admin expenses, and we believe economies of scales should improve profit because a major chunk of this expense is fixed in nature. Based on this analysis, we believe Groupon will improve its valuation of 14x, and recommend a long position in GRPN.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

996011,24802,2012-11-09T15:44:14-05:00,,"Few companies are as criticized and derided here on Seeking Alpha (or in the broader investment community) as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Since going public at the end of 2011, the company has lost over 80% of its value as the expectations investors had when it made its market debut have failed to materialize, to say the least. The company has gone through a good deal of turmoil over the past few quarters, and Q3 2012 was no exception, as Groupon missed estimates on both the top and bottom lines.However, when it comes to Groupon nothing is as simple as it seems, and this quarter is no exception. In this article, we will delve into the company's Q3 2012 results and will attempt to explain why we believe that although this quarter was not one that Groupon or its investors will be keen to remember, as it is not indicative of the company's full long-term potential. For the record, unless otherwise noted management commentary and financial data will be sourced from one of three places: Groupon's Q3 2012 earnings release, its Q3 2012 conference call, or its Q2 2012 earnings release, which will be used to show how Groupon is doing on a sequential basis. For purposes of disclosure, we hold a small position in Groupon.A Note on Emotions and HyperboleGroupon is one of several stocks here on Seeking Alpha where there is a great deal of emotion and hyperbole. The company is often accused of cooking the books (frankly, if Groupon is cooking the books, it isn't doing a very good job), and its competitive position is often attacked without firm proof of competitive weakness (more on competition later). Groupon's Q3 2012 results and the resulting fall in its stock price will be used as proof that Groupon cannot succeed, and that the entire business model cannot work. We think that such a view is simplistic. Emotion and hyperbole have no place in investing, and investors should not mold financial data to suit their opinions. Rather, opinions should be based on financial data. While Groupon's financials never supported a $20 stock price, we think that a share price under $3 does not reflect the full financial potential of Groupon, especially when the company's $1.2 billion in cash (with no debt) is taken into account. There are many things in Groupon's Q3 results that, in our view, serve to mask the company's true long-term potential. And in this article, we will attempt to show that while this quarter was by no means an outstanding one, it is not reflective of what Groupon is capable of.Q3 2012 OverviewGroupon posted its Q3 2012 earnings after the markets closed on November 8. The company broke even on a GAAP basis (a net loss of $2.979 million rounds to $0.00 in EPS) on revenues of $568.552 million. The company missed EPS estimates by 3 cents and revenue estimates by $21.5 million. However, Groupon's Q4 revenue forecast of $625-$675 million ($650 million at the midpoint) beat the consensus estimate of $633.9 million. Groupon forecast consolidated segment operating income of $30-$50 million for Q4, versus an estimate of $62 million. Groupon's European business is once again dragging the company down. While North American revenues grew by 80.5% year-over-year, international revenues grew by just 3.5%, resulting in overall revenue growth of 32.2% year-over-year. Revenue growth would have been 38.2% if negative effects of exchange rates are removed from the equation.Gross billings grew by 38% in North America, and dropped 12% internationally compared to a year ago. Gross billings once again shrank slightly in the quarter, down to $1.218256 billion, from $1.286676 billion in Q2 2012. Cash flow was also down, falling to $42.088 million, compared to $64.411 million a year ago (more on those figures later). In short, Groupon's Q3 results failed to impress the markets. And even higher than expected revenue guidance was not enough to overcome these results, as well as operating income guidance that missed expectations. But, Groupon's Q3 results are, in our view, not reflective of the company's long-term potential, and we begin to explain why belowTaxes: How Many Public Companies Have Tax Bills Above 100% of Profits?With operations all across the world, Groupon, like most publicly traded companies, must deal with a complex series of global tax policies. And for the past several quarters, Groupon has been paying taxes at a rate that few, if any public companies pay. In Q2 2012, Groupon paid $66.875 million in taxes on pretax income (on a GAAP basis) of $100.424 million (which includes income from an exchange in equity of its Chinese operations). That is equivalent to a tax rate of 66.59%. But that pales in comparison to Groupon's tax rate of 103.63% for Q3 2012 (taxes of $26.857 million on pre-tax income of $25.917 million). We doubt that analysts had estimated such a tax rate when compiling their forecasts, and a large part of Groupon's miss for this quarter is, in our view, due to this inflated tax rate. CFO Jason Child has not provided a detailed explanation for why Groupon has been paying so much in taxes. He has stated that Groupon is not yet able to offset its income in North America and other profitable markets with losses in some of its international markets. On the company's Q3 call, Child stated that,Groupon's taxes have been at unsustainably high rates for several quarters, and we do not think that they will stay at such levels for long. No public company has a tax rate of over 60% in the long run. With Brian Stevens appointed as the company's new Chief Accounting Officer in September (he moved from KPMG after spending 16 years in their audit and professional practice departments), we feel that Groupon will bring these tax rates under control. Many companies are chided for having poor earnings quality when they inflate earnings by being aggressive with their tax accounting. But, if that is indeed a valid criticism, then its converse must be true. Companies with artificially inflated tax rates need to be analyzed on the basis of what kind of profits they generate with a sustainable tax rate. Groupon would have posted a GAAP profit for Q3 2012 even if its tax rate for the quarter was the full statutory 35%, not 103.63%. As we read through Groupon's Q3 conference call, we were puzzled by the fact that none of the analysts that participated on the call questioned CFO Jason Child about the company's tax rate, which stands out to us as one of the most important issues in this quarter's results. Groupon's latest 10-Q filing for Q3 2012 states thatOver time, we believe that Groupon's tax rates will move lower, as the company restructures its accounting division, and this move will flow directly to Groupon's bottom line.Operating Expenses and European and International Markets: Leverage & Room for InvestmentGroupon's operating expenses continued to improve in Q3 2012, leaving the company with room to invest in its European operations. While the company's European business is lagging, it is important to know that this is due at least in part to the fact that Groupon has not yet optimized its European business in the same way that it has within the United States. On balance, it is better for a company to be exposed to a weak economy than for internal issues to be causing weakness in the long run. Groupon can, and will fix its internal issues in Europe, and the continent's economy will recover sooner or later. Below is a table of Groupon's expenses as a percentage of revenue for Q3 2012, Q2 2012, and Q3 2011 (Groupon breaks down its expenses into 3 categories: SG&A, marketing, and acquisition costs and benefits; we omit acquisition costs because they are not reflective of Groupon's business on a continuing basis).Groupon's core operating expenses have fallen year-over year and sequentially in both absolute and percentage terms as the company has streamlined its operations and rolled out technological improvements, such as deal personalization. On the company's Q3 call, CEO Andrew Mason stated that Groupon will be increasing its investments in its international markets. While this will likely push up operating expenses over the next few quarters, the company has some cushion due to its good cost controls over the last few quarters, thereby giving Groupon room to invest in its business overseas. CEO Andrew Mason stated thatGroupon's investments in Europe are already beginning to pay off. Merchant satisfaction is higher, and growth in Europe has been strong since September, as these new technology investments begin to stabilize the company's European business. While we do not believe that Groupon's European business will be fixed overnight, the company is on the right path, and as long as it continues to execute its international investment strategy as it is today, we believe that Groupon can, and will bring its international business up to the standards of its core North American business.Cash Flow, the Balance Sheet, and Merchant SatisfactionGroupon's Q3 2012 earnings release revealed that operating cash flow for the quarter came in at $42.088 million, down from $64.411 million a year ago. This decrease was driven primarily by changes in working capital. Groupon elected to pay down accrued expenses (separate from merchant payables) at a faster rate in Q3, and accrued merchants payable contributed $21.868 million to operating cash flow, compared to $98.002 million a year ago.As we outlined in several of our prior articles on Groupon, the company is slowly shifting its merchant customer base towards its American payment model, where merchants are paid within 60 days of a customer buying a Groupon. The majority of Groupon's international business still operates under a redemption model, where merchants are paid when a customer redeems their Groupon (these models are spelled out in Groupon's 10-Q filings). Groupon itself admits that operating cash flow is improved under the redemption payment model, and that is not something that we can argue. What we can argue, however, is that a shift to this model will not harm Groupon in the long run. Rather, it will improve merchant satisfaction, which will lead to higher revenues as more merchants are willing to run deals, which will in turn translate to higher cash flows as revenue and net income rise.Groupon's balance sheet is well-equipped to handle a temporary drop in operating cash flow. The company ended Q3 2012 with $1.201011 billion in cash & investment, which is equivalent to $1.83 per share, based on the company current outstanding share count of 655,716,096 shares.Active Customers, Gross Billings, and Mobile: Success on Several Fronts, Pressure on OthersGroupon ended Q3 2012 with 39.5 million active subscribers, representing growth of 37% from Q3 2011 and sequential growth from 38 million active customers at the end of Q2. In fact, active subscriber growth accelerated in Q3. Groupon added 1.5 million active customers in Q3, compared to 1.1 million in Q2.Click to enlarge image.Groupon's active customer growth accelerated on a percentage basis as well. In Q2 2012, active customers grew by 2.98% sequentially, and grew on by 3.95% sequentially in Q3. Groupon's total subscribers grew past 200 million in Q3, highlighting the fact that there is still potential to monetize the company's customer base further.Trailing 12-month gross billings per active customer fell 21% in Q3 to $149, due to softness in Groupon's international business. While this is a setback for the company, we believe that as the company continues to invest in optimizing its international business, gross billings per customer will rebound. Groupon is already seeing promising results, as CEO Andrew Mason has stated, and we think that the company's investments will bear fruit over the next several quarters.It is interesting to note that Groupon is one of the few major e-commerce companies to have a material presence in mobile [eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is another example]. In October, one-third of Groupon's North American transactions were completed on mobile devices, representing growth of 30% from October 2011. Groupon's mobile customers spend more with Groupon and spend more often than non-mobile customers. On the call, CEO Andrew Mason stated thatWe do not think that investors are giving Grouopon enough (or any) credit for its growing mobile business. Groupon's business model is more successful, and more profitable on mobile devices than on the desktop, and the company is well-positioned for the transition to mobile computing.Valuation and Estimates: Reconciling Contradictory ConclusionsAs of this writing, Groupon is falling sharply, dropping almost 30% on the back of its Q3 results. And analysts are stepping in, downgrading the stock and cutting estimates and price targets. In particular, we would like to highlight the research of Credit Suisse, which we believe highlights quite well the seeming contradictions that sell-side analysts have when it comes to Groupon. In its note on Groupon's Q3 results, Credit Suisse slashed its price target from $11 to $6.50 (a drop of 40.9%) and slashed fiscal 2012 estimates from 27 cents in pro forma EPS to 17 cents in pro forma EPS, which is equivalent to a cut of 37.04%. Fiscal 2013 estimates were cut from 53 cents in pro forma EPS all the way down to 26 cents in pro forma EPS, representing a cut of 50.94%. On the surface, these dramatic cuts seem to show that Groupon is incapable of turning itself around.However, even these reduced estimates call for 2013 EPS growth of 52.94%. And as of this writing, with Groupon trading at $2.86, the company is valued at 16.82x fiscal 2012 EPS, and just 11x fiscal 2013 EPS. ANd that is before Groupon's $1.83 per share in cash (with no debt on its balance sheet) is taken into account. As of this writing, 63.99% of Groupon's market capitalization is in cash, a ratio that has few, if any peers among public companies. On an ex-cash basis, Groupon trades at 5.53x fiscal 2012 estimates, and 3.62x fiscal 2013 estimates. Credit Suisse's price target of $6.50 serves to highlight the seeming contradictions here. Even after being cut by over 40%, that price target implies upside of over 127% from current levels. Credit Suisse rates Groupon a neutral, yet is calling for EPS growth of almost 53% in 2013, and has a price target that implies the stock will more than double. In our opinion, neutral-rated stock do not usually have price targets that call for a return of over 100%, and earnings estimates that call for growth of over 50%.Thoughts on Competition and Observational BiasThe argument that Groupon has no economic moat, and that barriers to entry are non-existent in daily deals and local commerce have been articulated since almost the moment that Groupon was founded. Critics of Groupon argue that anyone can compete with Groupon, and that all someone needs is a computer and some merchant contacts to beat Groupon at its own game. Nothing could be further from the truth. Groupon has well over 10,000 employees working around the world to serve both its customers and merchant partners, and it is the only daily deals company to be posting operating profits. LivingSocial, Groupon's primary competitor, is unprofitable, and has only begun to generate positive operating cash flow. LivingSocial's Q3 revenues of $124 million declined by 10.14% on a sequential basis (from $138 million in Q2), while Groupon's revenues still managed to grow (albeit just barely) on a sequential basis (they were up 0.038% sequentially).Furthermore, the argument that the largest technology companies will enter the daily deals market and destroy Groupon is, in our view, flawed as well. As proof, we offer the fact that most of these companies have already entered the market, and it has done little to affect Groupon. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has already tried to enter the daily deals market, and abandoned it in August 2011 after 4 months due to an inability to gain traction. Google has laid off a large number of its German daily deals employees because it cannot compete in that market. And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is still in the space, seems to be having no competitive effect on Groupon. For a company to compete successfully in daily deals and local commerce, a website and a computer is not enough. It takes thousands of employees across the globe to run a business of this size, and only Groupon has the scale and merchant relationships to do so. Furthermore, Groupon is expanding its suite of merchant tools, offering them an ecosystem of Groupon tools in order to cement their partnership even further. The company has launched both Groupon Payments (a payment service similar to Square) and Breadcrumb (an iPad point-of-sale system for restaurants). When Groupon launched its payment business, many had assumed that this was simple a desperate move y Groupon to try and find growth wherever it can. The truth, as expressed by CEO Andrew Mason, is different. On the company's Q3 call, he stated thatGroupon Payments and Breadcrumb are not about creating new profit streams for Groupon. Rather, they are about cementing relationship with merchants, as well as building what Groupon calls ""an operating system for local commerce."" No technology company has deep of a focus on local commerce as Groupon, and we believe that the company's competitive position and moat are far stronger than what many critics believe.We would like to turn now to the subject of observational bias. Many critics of Groupon, especially here on Seeking Alpha, equate their personal experiences with Groupon with the company's overall competitive position. To do so misses the nuances of Groupon's business. The company runs different deals in every city it operates in, and when it comes to daily deals and local commerce, no two markets are the same. What works in one city may not work in another. And simply because someone is unable to find deals they deem ""relevant"" in their own city does not mean that it is true for all of Groupon's markets, or that it is even true for the city in question. A deal that you find to be irrelevant may be of great value to someone down the street. Emotions and biases have no place when it comes to investing, and linking one's personal experience with a company to its investment potential is, in our view, a flawed way of investing. Groupon needs to be examined based on its overall performance, not how it operates in just one market. Investors also need to remember that Groupon cannot please every single customer 100% of the time (for that matter, no company can do so). As long as the company benefits consumers and merchants (the issue of merchant satisfaction is something we have examined in detail in our prior articles on Groupon), it will continue to bring in both repeat and new business, as consumers and merchants discover the benefit and utility of Groupon.ConclusionsIs Groupon worth $20 per share (its IPO price)? We do not think so. While we are bullish on the company's long-term prospects, we do not believe that Groupon can rally that far. But, we also think that Groupon is worth a good deal more than $2 or $3 per share. The company's financial position is solid, and it is investing in its international business to bring its performance up to North American standards. The company's competitive position is far stronger than most investors realize, and Groupon is succeeding in mobile in a way that few other technology or commerce companies are.Is Groupon a stock for risk-averse investors? We do not think so. And we do not think that risk-averse investors should compromise their beliefs to buy shares of Groupon. But, for investors who can tolerate some risk, and are willing to be patient, we believe that Groupon will be a profitable investment in the long run. While Groupon's Q3 2012 results were not solid, they are not indicative of its long-term potential. We believe that Groupon's best days are ahead of it, and believe that investors who add to or initiate positions in Groupon will, in the long run, be rewarded for their conviction.Disclosure: I am long GRPN, FB, AMZN.

900511,28831,2012-10-02T15:12:33-04:00,,"To say that I have not been a fan of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares since the IPO is an understatement. I even made a small profit from a short position that, regrettably, I held only for a few days. The main issues for me were stock's high valuation and, more importantly, the lack of barriers to entry for the business. Every day, new daily deal sites were popping up all over the world. Even though imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this worrying trend showed how easily everybody could clone Groupon's ingenious business idea and become a competitor.Even the constant drop in the share price did not entice me to go long Groupon. After all, in my mind the business model was fundamentally flawed.When the announcement of Groupon Payments came out, I realized the company is both diversifying its business and adding to its competitive advantages. After doing some research, it became apparent to me that Groupon is striving to be much more than just a daily deals site.Let's take a look at what has changed for Groupon in the past few months.DiversificationIn the past few months, Groupon has extended its offerings for the local merchants meaningfully and will likely continue to do so. The company is transforming itself from a daily deals business to what Andrew Mason, Groupon's CEO, calls ""an operating system for local commerce."" The goal is for Groupon to become a major commerce platform and an end-to-end solution provider to local merchants. Today, Groupon's businesses include:Competitive AdvantagesMost of the businesses that Groupon operates in are very competitive. While the company lacks any discernible moats, it does possess some important competitive advantages. These include:Brand Name Recognition: Groupon is by far the best known company in the daily deals business. In fact, many people call daily deals ""Groupons"" even when referring to deals from competitors. This is akin to people calling tissue paper ""Kleenex"" or MP3 players ""iPods."" It demonstrates a powerful and valuable brand.Scale: Scale is important in more than one way in this business. As the largest daily deals company in the world, Groupon can leverage its sales organization and database of businesses to scale its recent and future small acquisitions into globally relevant brands and services.Groupon can also leverage its financial and engineering resources to develop and distribute tools for local commerce to try and lock merchants into its platform. The free Groupon Scheduler is a first step. I would not be surprised if Groupon makes a move into POS, analytics, accounting, and inventory management software-as-a-service area for small, local merchants.Of course, Groupon does not have the upper hand on its larger competitors such as Google and Amazon as far as scale goes. However, it can easily out-compete the smaller players with less resources. I suspect in a few years many of the smaller competitors will be either forced out or acquired. The race to the top will be between a few, large companies.Sales and Analytics ExpertiseDesigning an effective deal is not as straightforward as it seems. A good deal brings in as many clients as possible without going over budget or overwhelming the business with a flood of customers. From the merchant's perspective, a good deal also encourages customers to spend beyond the value of their voucher. Deal frequency can also be a factor in what percentage of users become regular paying customers as opposed to just deal hunters.With its vast database of past deals and analytical data across many businesses and geographies, Groupon is strongly positioned in the industry to design the best deals for its merchants and its end users. Groupon can also apply its knowledge database to its new offerings, such as Groupon Rewards and Groupon Now.Platform SynergiesThere are significant synergies to be had from becoming an end-to-end commerce platform for local merchants. Groupon Payments can significantly simplify the process of redeeming a Groupon both for the merchant and the customer. I imagine in the near future when a customer uses a credit card associated with his or her Groupon account to pay at a Groupon Payments terminal, the system will automatically deduct the amount of Groupon from the bill, charge the rest to the card, and mark the Groupon as used. There will be no need to even present a voucher.Groupon Payments can also offer valuable data on customer purchasing habits that can be leveraged in designing Rewards programs and Daily Deals. Other opportunities include integrating Groupon Deals, Groupon Now, Savored, and BreadCrumb for a complete restaurant management, reservation, and yield enhancement solution.FinancialsGroupon is hard to value. It is a young company with an evolving business model in a fast changing competitive landscape. Any assumption about its future financial performance can be grossly inaccurate. As such, I will not go into much detail in terms of valuation, but will discuss a few points worth mentioning.Balance Sheet: Groupon has $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt, and a current ratio of 1.3. This gives the company flexibility to invest in new technologies and acquire complimentary businesses.Operating Cash Flow: Groupon generated $159 million of cash from operation in the first half of 2012. However, most of this came from increasing accrued expenses ($63 million), merchant payable ($32 million), and accounts payable ($18 million).While working capital management is important, withholding payments from merchants for longer and increasing payables is not a sustainable source of cash flow. I would keep an eye on Groupon's cash flow and, more importantly, its sources in the coming quarters.Reasonable Forward P/E: Twenty-three analysts who cover Groupon on average expect the company to earn $0.36/share in FY 2013. At $4.70/share, the stock is trading at a reasonable forward P/E of 13. Of course, because of the dynamic nature of the business and the competitive landscape, any forward estimates should be taken with a grain of salt.Unusually High Tax Rate: In 2011, Groupon paid $44 million in income taxes even though the company had a before-tax loss of $254 million. Last quarter, the company's tax rate was 67%. The reason for this unusual tax situation is that Groupon has been unable to deduct its losses in unprofitable jurisdictions from profits in other countries. The situation should correct itself if Groupon becomes profitable in all jurisdictions. There may also be opportunities for Groupon to reduce its tax bill by optimizing corporate structure, and moving some expenses to highest tax jurisdictions.ConclusionI view Groupon's move to diversify its business and move toward becoming a platform for the multitrillion-dollar local commerce market as a positive for the company. Groupon possesses unique competitive advantages -- even against its larger rivals such as Google and Amazon -- that give it a fair shot at achieving this goal. I believe below $5/share the stock is a good speculative purchase. I would wait for proof of progress in executing its business plan and improvements in cash flow quality and earnings before taking a large position in the stock.Disclosure: I am long GRPN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

903151,34951,2012-10-03T15:53:59-04:00,,"In November last year, the company offering discounts to buyers had a remarkable IPO at the Nasdaq stock exchange, which was the largest among Internet companies since Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) IPO in 2004. Underwriters have sold about 35 million shares at $20 per share through increasing the share offering price and its number. This signified that the company's capitalization was about $13 billion as well as that the company attracted about $700 million of capital it desperately required for development. More insightful speculators managed to sell their shares with a profit, while the less risky ones remained with either paper or fixed loss. It hurts to watch and to bear an investment that has dropped from $20 to $5 in less than a year. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares were that kind of an investment instrument.I have always been cautious in regard to the so-called hot IPO of non-profit technological companies and have not taken part in such offerings. Practice shows that it is less risky for an investor (not a speculator!) to wait for the beginning of trades (for the appearance of earnings is even better) and buy liquid shares on the open market. Groupon stands as another proof for that truth (see the company's shares graph below).Source: bigcharts.marketwatch.comWe should also mention that the investment bankers have brilliantly chosen the time for Groupon IPO, just as they did with that of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (they know what they are doing!). The quarterly report following the offering was able to support Groupon shares at the price of IPO, while the 2011 annual report marketed the beginning of the stock prices free fall. Groupon offered class A shares, with the voting right of 1 vote per share. At the same time, the founders own all class B shares with the voting right of 150 votes per share as well as a part of class A shares. As a result, the majority stake at the shareholders' meeting belongs to the business founders. This is especially significant when voting for a purchase or merging of companies, which I will mention later. By the end of March 2012, there were 343 registered shareholders which is not a large number for a company with a 10M shares daily turnover. Groupon capitalization is $3.3B as of September 20, 2012 (over 70% less than the capitalization at IPO).Let's analyze Groupon business-model, the reasons for the current situation, the company's advantages and disadvantages and drawing conclusions for the future. The service of Groupon, Inc., a company founded in October 2008, consists in creating a new way to attract clients for business via internet. Traditionally, local sellers attract customers through papers, Yellow Pages, street advertisers, etc. Groupon offers benefits both for the sellers offering commodities to the target audience on a certain territory and to the buyers who wish to get discounts for the goods and services they are interested in. Judging by its market share, Groupon does what it does quite successfully, being the market share leader in 37 out of 48 countries where it has presence.Groupon services include the following: Featured Daily Deals, when the company sends the best offers from local sellers of goods and services providers to the target audience daily; Groupon Now! is a service launched in order to control the customer flow at a certain time, for example, during the period of day or month when the demand is traditionally low while the potential customers are hungry or bored; Groupon Goods consists in selling discount vouchers for commodities through the web-site; Groupon Getaways offers tourist industry promotions; Groupon Live offers concert tickets and tickets for events interesting for clients; Groupon Rewards is a marketing decision launched to gain clients' loyalty.Groupon makes money through collecting payment from clients and gaining the so-called gross billing, which does not equal to the company's revenue. Then Groupon pays the negotiated price to the commodity or service provider, following an exclusive sale agreement signed for a certain term. Groupon pays the North American companies within 60 days from the sale of a product or service to the end consumer. Per the rest of international companies, the payment is realized after the client has paid and used the service or has purchased the product. Therefore, Groupon has an opportunity to use the clients' money to finance its working capital.The difference between what Groupon receives from the customer and what it pays to its client represents the sales level. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2010, Groupon earned 41.5% of the Gross Billing amount and 40% of Gross Billing amount in the 4th quarter of 2011, i.e. the company's ""commission"" is fairly high. It is an unusual situation considering low industry penetration borders and high competition.The company actively invests into acquiring the potential clients' databases, namely businesses possessing technologies which would enable Groupon to benefit in the future. In Europe, the company has partnered with Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF) which enables Groupon to distribute its mobile app to clients through smartphones provided by the European giant. In the USA, the company has partner programs with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Yahoo! (YHOO), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), thanks to which Groupon Daily Deals appear and are promoted on the mentioned companies' web-sites through their client database in exchange for a part of sale revenues. Above that, the company acquires subscribers via word-of-mouth advertising, search engines marketing, banner advertising, TV, radio, sponsor programs, social networks, its web-site and mobile applications. With the growth of business, Groupon forecasts that marketing expenses as a % from sales for attracting subscribers will decrease. This index has a clear downgrading tendency having dropped from 78% in the 1st quarter of 2011 to 21% in the 1st quarter of 2012, while marketing expenses within the international sector of the business are higher than those within the North American.A short company history is presented in the table below (extract from 10-K):The table below shows the actual and forecast quarterly revenue dynamics proving the company's growth slowing tendency. In 2008, Groupon sales were $5 and impressive $1.6B in 2011. The company receives about 55% of sales from its international activity and 45% from the North American, meaning the company is global.The main expenses are not Costs of Goods, but Marketing Costs which are the expenses for attracting new subscribers and expenses for attracting new business clients reflected in Selling, General, and Administrative Costs.However, despite multiple growths of sales, the number of subscribers, planned income in 2012, strong balance two thirds of which is represented by cash and its equivalents, the investors are still skeptical in regards to Groupon. Why?First of all, Groupon announcement regarding its significantly loose internal financial statements control procedures on the background of the Chinese companies reporting scandals disappointed the investors: the 2011 numbers seemed doubtful in such case. Despite the right decision to hire a professional with many years of work experience with KPMG, the spot in the company's history and investors' memory remained.Secondly, the company is slowing down. We will hardly witness the multiple growth rates of the last three years in the future. For example, in 2011 the company's revenue was $1.6B (433% growth compared to 2010). By the results of 2012 the revenue is expected at $2.4 B, meaning the growth is 50%. The expected revenue in 2013 is $2.8B, i.e. only 17% growth compared to the previous year.The barrier to enter the industry is low, and competition will increase which means that it would become more difficult to support the ""commission"" level of a deal at 40% every year. Moreover, the mere notion of ""a discount"" is vague in regards to the sale of products and services. For instance, in public catering industry where the margin is high, it is realistic to offer a 30% discount. However, such discounts are hardly applicable to most commodities producers. Per long-term perspective, it seems that the company's clients will mostly be new businesses willing to inform customers about its product. While the question whether the customer will return for another purchase depends on his/her satisfaction rather than on Groupon efforts. Mature businesses may also use Groupon services from time to time, but they cannot keep selling their product or service at half price for endlessly long period at the expense of profitability.In order to increase its sales and market share, the company actively invested into sales force. By the end of 2011, over 5000 sales representatives around the world worked for Groupon. The table below shows their growth and regional distribution.Groupon was founded in 2008, the year of ""the Great Recession."" Such services are popular during crisis when people tend to save. I do not think that the global issue will be resolved in the nearest years to come, however, with greater stability, the businesses will be providing less discounts seeing the possibility to sell for more, and the end consumers will more incline to consume products and services even though discounts would not be provided. Professional sales representatives are a significant asset for the company. It is strategically more important for Groupon to attract businesses which would sell their services with discounts. Attracting an end consumer, for instance, to a restaurant having discounts appears to be an easier task. At the same time, competitors act similarly, hiring sales representative around the globe. With tightening competition and decreasing level of ""commission,"" keeping sales representatives working off commission is possible only at the expense of business profitability for companies like Groupon.Despite the launch of Groupon Rewards program, end consumers tend to choose a product based on the price rather than the brand. From my point of view, such business loyalty to a company like Groupon is doubtful. If an average consumer finds the same product offered by another ""discounter,"" he/she would rather go there, it is the discount-hunter psychology.So, the Groupon IPO share price of $20 was indeed overstated, but what can be said now, when the price is about $5 per share or even less? The $5 rate is a psychological benchmark, and if the management believes in the future of the company, it can regard the possibility to repurchase shares from the market if there is over $1B of cash available on the company's balance sheet (a third of the business capitalization!) and almost no debts. This will cause short-sellers to panic, considering that 20% of all the shares traded were shorted by the end of August. On the other hand, if the management does not believe in the company's future, Groupon can be a target to be purchased by the giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google. It would be especially beneficial for Amazon to exchange shares with Groupon now, taking into account Amazon's overestimated shares.In September 2012, the company launched Groupon Payments to promote the business synergy and margin growth, which is a strategically correct decision. From now on, businesses that use Groupon services have an opportunity to pay less for processing their transaction thus increasing profitability. The new service caused a positive reaction of the market: GRPN shares increased by 13% on the announcement day with the volumes increasing by 3.2 times the average.Based on current rates, the ratio of Groupon capitalization to the sales is lower than the industry average (1.7 and 2 accordingly). The company is expected to gain its first earnings of $0.18 per share in 2012. The earnings expected in 2013 are $0.37 per share. This stands for P/E in 2012 is 29, while the expected P/E in 2013 is 14.4. Taking into account the expected earnings per share growth at 30% rate in the coming 5 years, considering relative indexes, Groupon does not appear to be very expensive even for value investors at the moment. What remains is to fulfill the expectations of earnings.So, Groupon is a global company, but at the same time, its shares are speculative today. I would hardly include its shares into a portfolio of a long-term investor, whose objective is to accumulate pension savings or funds for education due to the existence of better alternatives. At the same time, Groupon's price level may be attractive for speculators.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

878761,24276,2012-09-20T12:49:33-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is evolving from a deal site into a transaction processor.At the heart of Groupon's Groupon Payments offering is a lower discount rate, as low as 1.8% on Visa and MasterCard, notes Digital Trends. This is in contrast to the 2.5% usually charged merchants, and the 2.75% charged by Square.Groupon is also taking a direct approach to the market, rather than using the re-seller networks tied to banks that its ""rivals"" in transaction processing use. This may help justify the lower discount, but it should be added here that Groupon is taking on some risk here. The discount rate is meant to compensate processors and banks for possible fraud by either merchants or customers. Groupon is betting that companies which have used its social services will be better-than-average risks.For companies that haven't used Groupon before, the discount is higher, but still just 2.2%, plus a 15 cent per transaction ""swipe fee."" It's currently available only through the iPhone, under iOS6, but the rectangular ""dongle,"" which plugs into the audio jack, is free.The other, more important benefit for merchants is access to their own data. They can instantly see how their offers have done, and get Groupon's help in tweaking them. This gives the company a big leg-up over the other deal site providers.Groupon's base business has been getting hammered lately by commentators like Bill Bice. But this is a potentially a much better business than that. Crain's Chicago Business notes that the offering came through the acquisition of a payment startup called Fee Fighters that actually began as a price comparison service.And this should be seen as the company's major risk here. It's not easy to get into payments. There are huge security risks, which can result in losing access to Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) from a single incident. But those risks are smaller (if deeper) when a company is small, and unscaled. So there is an opportunity here for Groupon to completely transform itself.Those who bet on Groupon at its launch as a social service had better take another look at the stock. That's not what it is any more.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

861411,24473,2012-09-11T20:18:52-04:00,,"As much as I detest social media stocks (and continue to believe the sector is in a bubble), I will admit Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) trading under $5 caught my interest. Groupon has now dropped 80%+ since its November IPO, and appears to have reached a more normalized valuation at 12.2x forward earnings.But for detailed reasons hidden in its Q2 report, Groupon still appears to be an excellent short candidate.Growth Has PeakedMuch like its peer Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Groupon is starting to see growth decline much faster than anticipated.After taking a closer look at Q2 growth when compared to prior quarters, it's clear why shares have been hit so hard. Groupon experienced a major slowdown in overall growth in Q2, mostly because of weakness internationally.International revenue accounts for about 54% of Groupon's total sales (as of Q2). For the first time since going public, international revenue actually fell Q/Q. Groupon originally blamed this on European softness, which seems a tad ironic to me.If anything, weakness in the European economy should have increased the relevance of Groupon's Daily Deals. It's only natural to see consumers shift towards more spending conscious habits in times of economic weakness. We saw proof of this in 08/09 when Americans started going to McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) because of the recession.Costs Still Rising Faster Than SalesCost of revenue grew 146% in Q2, while total revenue grew just 39%. Despite rapidly rising costs, Groupon has still been able to keep operating income rising by cutting marketing expenses.Ironically, Groupon repeatedly brags about this in its investor presentations.Is it just me, or could a massive slowdown in revenue growth be somewhat correlated to a massive slowdown in marketing expenses?I believe so, and unfortunately for Groupon, this game is going to have to end soon. In 2010, Groupon grew sales 2,060% - by far Groupon's fastest growing year ever. In Q4 2010 (the biggest quarter of that year), Groupon's marketing expenses were $201 million vs. $172 million in revenue.In Q2 2012, marketing expenses totaled just $88 million. I don't see how Groupon will be able to drop these much further without continuing to negatively impact sales. But even if Groupon did choose to drop its marketing expenses another 90%, it wouldn't matter. Cost of revenue climbed $80 million from Q2 2011 to Q2 2012, and is on pace to climb another $197 million (reaching $332 total (~40% of revenue) per quarter) by Q2 2013.Groupon will not be able to drop marketing expenses fast enough to outpace the rising cost of revenue by the end of 2012.This leads to another (and actually even bigger) problem.Operating Income Doomed To Turn NegativeGroupon's Q3 outlook now calls for $15-35 million in operating income, which would be feasible if Groupon were able to hit analysts' $595 million Q3 revenue estimate (an increase of $27 million from Q2). But I doubt that's going to happen.Groupon only increased revenue by $9 million in Q2 (1/3 of which will be needed next quarter) and Q3 has been a seasonally weak quarter for growth.That, combined with continually depressed marketing expenses, makes a turnaround for growth unlikely. Additionally, Q2 was Groupon's first quarter in over 2 years which saw gross billings decline Q/Q.Gross billings are the invoices Groupon sends to its clients, and thus a leading indicator of revenue. This first Q/Q decline emphasizes the frailness of Groupon's business model. Right now, Groupon has the #1 market share in 37 of the 48 countries it operates in. As competition continues to heat up, and the 'Daily Deals' market matures into a period of saturation, Groupon's hockey-stick growth pattern is history.As Groupon struggles to maintain its prior growth rate (45% Y/Y revenue appreciation), exponential cost increases will reverse its trend of rising margins. This has serious negative impacts on both future EPS projections and future operating income.Estimates Will Continue To FallIn the past 90 days, earnings estimates for 2013 have almost been cut in half ($0.70 to $0.37). Analysts have already started to note potential margin erosion from rising costs and a bottoming in marketing expenditures.This will continue as Groupon struggles to maintain any sort of meaningful revenue growth. Despite lowered consensus estimates, Groupon is still projected to see a large sales increase in the back half of 2012. With declining international sales, and an increasingly saturated market, those targets will have a hard time being met. For this reason, estimates are poised to fall further.What Groupon Bulls SayGroupon bulls like to highlight 2 key aspects that make the stock an attractive investment at these historically cheap levels.It's trading at 1.5x salesThis may be the cheapest price/sales multiple in the social media space, but other than that it doesn't mean much. Even if Groupon is able to fully execute its business model, margins are razor thin. Essentially, Groupon's model is to cut into retail profits by referring brick and mortar stores new customers. Most of these retail store margins are already low, and Groupon can only hope to capture a small portion of them. Thus, it's logical to conclude Groupon will trade at a lower P/S multiple than its social media peers.$1.2 billion in cashThis does represent ~35% of Groupon's current market cap. But the only chance of this cash adding any value is through strategic acquisitions - I doubt Groupon would pay a dividend or initiate a buyback so soon after an IPO. Groupon has already showed a willingness to acquire start-ups, but has had little success. Zynga has also tried the growth via acquisition strategy, and had limited success. The bottom line is that in its current state, Groupon will start bleeding cash before it can use its equity to add shareholder value.ConclusionAs growth peaks and costs continue to skyrocket, Groupon still appears to be an attractive short candidate.Even with lowered estimates, Groupon's expectations remain too high. In the next several quarters, Groupon will need to demonstrate a huge turnaround in revenue growth or investors will be disappointed yet again. I do not see any catalyst for this revenue growth, especially after such a weak Q2 report, and increasing downward pressure on marketing expenditures.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

895451,22762,2012-09-28T18:26:51-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenThe churn at Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) executive level continues apace. The company has just announced  that it has appointed a new vice president for North America, Rob  Kilgarriff, who is taking over the role from Chris Muhr. Earlier today, Reuters reported  that Chris Muhr was being shipped out to Europe, where he had first  started his career with Groupon, to become the new SVP for Europe,  Middle East and Africa as the daily deals company looks to fix its  flagging European business.Muhr has replaced Veit Dengler, who had joined from Dell (DELL-OLD) only in April  to take up the reigns as the Sawmer brothers began their gradual  stepping away from management roles at the company. (The Sawmers’  CityDeal, acquired by Groupon, forms the basis of Groupon’s European  operation.) Kilgarriff will report to SVP of global operations Kal  Raman.“After nearly three years with Groupon in both Europe and the U.S. and  MyCityDeal before that, I’m excited about this next opportunity to lead  our EMEA business,” said Chris Muhr, SVP and GM, EMEA.  “My main  priorities right now are the successful rollout of our new technologies  in EMEA and giving our customers the very best experiences through  outstanding offers and service.”In addition to replacing the position made vacant by Muhr, the appointment of Kilgarriff could point to two other things.First, as consumer interest in daily deals has petered out, Groupon  has been making a big effort to reposition its business away from being  focused solely on daily deals, to becoming more of a one-stop e-commerce  shop for local retailers. But with the skills the company is picking up in its executives, there may be other plans ahead for kinds of content.  Kilgarriff is joining from online course developer GlobalScholar,  which is also where Raman was before joining Groupon. Kilgarriff  reported to him there, too. Before GlobalScholar, Kilgarriff held roles  at Reader’s Digest, Plato Learning, Jostens Corp., and Project Achieve.  Anecdotally, I’ve heard that learning is one of the more popular  categories on Groupon.Second, the appointment shows Raman is consolidating some control  over the whole organization and putting people he has worked well with  in the past as his lieutenants.“I’ve seen firsthand how effectively Rob leads a sales force; he  truly understands what motivates a sales team, drives revenue, and  unites departments across an organization,” said Kal Raman, SVP Global  Sales and Operations, said in a statement. “With a focus on high quality  deals and operational excellence, we’re confident he’ll lead the team  to serve our greater mission — customer and merchant satisfaction.”The news follows the announcement earlier this week that Groupon had purchased restaurant bookings/discount site Savored.Groupon’s shares are trading at $4.77, at the low end of its three-month range.Original Post"
852801,29461,2012-09-07T07:14:52-04:00,,"Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) went public in November last year. Since the IPO, the stock price has fallen by nearly 80%. Following the 2Q2012 earnings release, the stock price took a dip of nearly 30% on the news of a lower guidance for Consolidated Segment Operating Income (CSOI) margins of 8%-11%, lower than the estimated 13%. The dip also came on the news that the company missed market expectations of an increase in active customers by 0.8mn, and news of a lower revenue forecast for the coming years due to conservative international growth estimates. The current depressed level of the stock price can be an ideal entry point for investors, as the growing numbers of active customers, and the large addressable domestic and international markets, present a bright future outlook for the company - which is why we recommend investors buy the stock.Groupon is a 'deal of the day' company that offers discount coupons and connects merchants to consumers by offering goods and services in North America, as well as internationally. In the second quarter of 2012, Groupon experienced an increase of 65% YoY in active customers; now it has 38mn active customers, and a market capitalization of over $2.74 billion. The growing markets and increasing number of registered users will help the company increase its market share. Groupon has a strong and long-lasting business model that keeps customers and merchants connected to the company, as merchants get an opportunity to sell their excess inventory and market their products, while customers benefit from the significant discount offerings (30%-50%).Second quarter revenues missed estimates by 0.8%. Revenues in the second quarter of 2012 were $568.3 million, reflecting an increase of 45% YoY. Groupon has became more efficient at marketing by adding more customers, while spending less. Marketing expenses decreased by 58% in 2Q2012, as compared with 2Q2011. Lower marketing expenses helped in improving profit margins, which are experiencing an upward move; the trend is expected to continue. The take rate, along with a growing customer base, led to growth in revenues. The company has a take rate of over 40%; the threat of competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can, however, cause the take rate to decline, as some merchants ask for bigger cuts.The company has been focusing on the development of new technologies to address the growth opportunities available. The newer technology helped Groupon in growing its North American revenue by 66% YoY in the second quarter. Proximity in local deals is key to purchase behavior, as the conversion rate of nearby deals is higher than the conversion rate for deals at a long distance.'Groupon Now' is a company product that allows customers in North America to make purchases from smartphones, and it contributed nearly 30% of North American transactions in April. To boost the North American revenues, Groupon has signed a partnership with Nokia (NYSE:NOK). 'Groupon Now', which is an offer on Nokia maps, gives directions to locations to redeem offers using the Nokia navigation system, and where U.S. users can buy from their phones. This will help the company increase its revenues, as average North American mobile customers spend 50% more than customers who have never purchased from smartphones. This will help boost profit margins, as North American sales contribute significantly to the operating margin. Consolidated Segment Operating Income margins reached a positive mark of 12% in the second quarter of 2012, as compared to -16% in the second quarter of 2011, and the trend is expected to continue.Click to enlargeSource: Groupon.comThe company has evolved by reaching out to the international markets, which now represent the largest chunk of its revenues. International revenues contributed nearly 54% to total revenues in 2Q2012. International markets provide a potential for the company to grow and tap revenue opportunities, as these markets are less penetrated. Groupon is planning to introduce newer technology and newer deals with increased relevance.Despite these international growth opportunities, factors such as investment needs, quick implementation and integration of new technology, and an appreciation of the dollar could adversely affect the company's revenue growth. To meet investment needs for expansion, the company could opt for debt financing, as currently Groupon does not have any debt on its balance sheet.Source: Yahoofinance.comThe 30% per year growth rate estimate for Groupon for the next five years is higher than the industry estimate of 19.5%. Going forward, given the growth expectations, there is a potential for price appreciation. The company's P/S ratio of 1.4x is below Google's 5.2x, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) 9.5x and competitors' average of 5.5x, indicating that Groupon is relatively undervalued. According to the EV/S and PEG, the stock is an attractive one, and is trading at a discount as compared to its competitors, Facebook and Google.We recommend buying Groupon based on its revenue growth, the introduction of newer technology, and international market opportunities. However, we maintain that a few risks could be potential hurdles for the company's future performance. Investors should keep an eye on future profit margins, how the company executes its expansion plans, and how it capitalizes on its growth opportunities. These might signal a decline in the stock price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

This spike came due to the announcement of the new Groupon online payments system. The Smartphone Industry has seen phenomenal growth over the last couple of years. The growth has been so impressive that many iconic technology companies have been caught completely off guard, while others have created tons of shareholder value. The biggest beneficiary of this growth should be e-commerce. As computing shifts to pockets, e-commerce growths rates will improve. According to Gartner estimates, the Mobile Payment Transaction Industry alone will be a $600 billion industry by 2016. The main players in the industry are Paypal, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Square. We believe that there is a lot of growth in this industry and there is room for entry. Considering a large cash portfolio (30% of market cap), an experienced sales force, and an existing relationship with merchants, we are bullish on Groupon Payments (NASDAQ:GP). The company has shown a YoY growth rate of 66% in revenues during the last quarter, with a take rate of 40%. Due to these reasons, we recommend a long position in GPRN.Groupon PaymentsThe company on Wednesday launched its mobile payment solution, called Groupon Payments. The service allows merchants, such as restaurant owners and book stores, to collect payments through credit cards at cheaper prices. Groupon Payments gives users a free audio reader or a $100 card reader. The card readers being distributed by Groupon have been manufactured by Rom Data. These readers can be attached to an iPod touch or an iPhone. The system is currently aimed at smaller merchants who find credit card transactions very expensive. There are other benefits for small business holders besides low transaction charges. According to the company, merchants who use these cards will be able to analyze transaction histories, check daily sales reports, and review long-term revenue trends.Merchants already engaged in business with Groupon will get the lowest rates. The existing Groupon customers will pay a transaction fee of 1.8%, plus 15 cents from Visa (NYSE:V), Master (NYSE:MA) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). The rates will be higher for American Express (NYSE:AXP) card holders; 3% plus 15 cents per transaction. The charges for users not using Groupon will be higher. Businesses not offering deals through Groupon's website will be charged 2.2 cents (Master, Visa and Discover), and 3% for American Express plus 15 cents per transaction. Merchants are being charged 2.75% by Square and 2.7% by Paypal.Source: Qineqt CalculationsIn the table given above, we have calculated the charges that merchants will have to incur when using different payment solutions and cards. GP on American Express is more expensive than the competition. However, when you look at GP for its merchants on other cards, it is cheaper when transactions are above $16. The difference becomes more significant as the transaction amount increases. Therefore, the table shows that Groupon Payments will be a cheaper solution for Groupon merchants and merchants as a whole.ConclusionWe are bullish on Groupon and have already explained how the company is undervalued. The stock is currently trading at $5.11, whereas using December '13 sell-side EPS of $0.37 and industry average P/E of 20x, we can establish a price target of $7.5. Moreover, we believe the Groupon Payment system will have a very positive impact on the business model. It will give merchants another incentive to sign up with Groupon. Moreover, as a standalone business, GP can generate good growth, as it is providing services at a lower cost. According to Gartner, the Mobile Payment Industry can grow to more than $600 billion by 2016. Therefore, we think that GP can show significant growth in this high-growth market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

Shares are now down over 83 percent since the IPO. It turns out that Google's $6 billion offer to Groupon would have been the better option after a series of earnings disappointments, a gaggle of accounting adjustments, and several quarters in the red. With its first profitable quarter now in the rear view mirror and with more profitable quarters expected to follow, is now the time to buy Groupon at under $5?One of my trading mantras is that if a stock's price has gone down 80 percent in under a year, it can always go down another 80 percent. Groupon is no exception. The company has done a good job staying at the front of the market as Google Offers and Living Social have still not come close to surpassing the daily deals site. Most of its competition has come from a host of companies beefing up their rewards programs. This includes rewards and cash back programs from credit card companies along with customer rewards programs of many restaurants and retailers. They can leverage their already profitable businesses to create deals similar to Groupon's at a cheaper cost to their partner companies. In addition many of Groupon's previous partners have realized they can promote their own deals and not have to pay the hefty 50 percent premium that Groupon usually takes.Based on analyst estimates, Groupon is expected to have around 30 percent per annum earnings growth over the next five years, along with a 37 cent earnings per share estimate in 2013. At its current price of $4.26, Groupon actually looks like a good value buy right now. This low valuation is by no means an oversight by the market. Many investors expect more accounting mistakes and missed earnings over the next few years. Groupon's revenue was $1.6 billion in 2011 and its expected revenue in 2013 is $2.83. Many Groupon subscribers have already gotten sick of daily deals e-mails that are for the most part useless, so growing the business by that much in such a short time is going to be a giant challenge.Right now I would put a hold-to-sell recommendation on Groupon. The bubble looks like it's finished bursting for now, but I still do not trust the management or business model enough to make Groupon a part of my portfolio. I would expect shares to fluctuate between $3 and $6 over the next year and I don't believe Groupon's infamous one day swings will become a thing of the past. Shares are simply too volatile for the average investor.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The beleaguered stock has fallen by more than 80% since it first started trading on November 4, 2011.Accounting issues aside, investors have long had a reason to be skeptical of Groupon's business model of selling coupons. Granted, Groupon found a new way to sell coupons by requiring a minimum number of consumers to participate in the deal, but at the end of the day, consumers are paying Groupon to get a discount at a local business. Newspapers have long distributed coupons and advertised promotions. Plus, there is no shortage of companies delivering coupons to consumers' mailboxes and email inboxes. Visiting a company's website, liking its page on Facebook or signing up for its newsletter can also provide discounts. In short, there are plenty of venues to find deals (and I haven't even mentioned Groupon-like competitors such as Living Social or websites such as RetailMeNot.com).Successful growth companies find a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. Philip Fisher wrote about the importance of having a clear competitive advantage in his classic book, ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits,"" originally published in 1958. It's no different in the technology and Internet arena. Successful companies both create new value for customers and erect tough barriers to entry, as this AAII Journal article explains. (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are two good examples of companies that create value and have erected barriers to competition.)In contrast, Groupon merely had a new idea for how to promote and distribute coupons. Its crowd-oriented deals attracted a lot of favorable press initially, but there has been backlash since. Although some businesses have had success using the service, others have complained that the offers only bring deal-seekers, as opposed to creating new repeat customers. There have also been reports about unhappy consumers who have found restaurants packed or otherwise had difficulty making use of the coupons. In other words, the amount of value being created is questionable.A new business story is exciting, but as Groupon has showed, it is always important to step back and ask whether there is any real substance behind the hype. As the stock's price performance indicates in the case of Groupon, many investors have determined that the answer is ""no.""Charles Rotblut, CFA is a Vice President with the American Association of Individual Investors and editor of the AAII Journal.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

There are nuances in each business model and strategy, nuances that take time to understand and evaluate. And in this article, we would like to discuss one of the most misunderstood companies on the market today: Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Groupon has had a tumultuous history since its founding in 2008. It has gone from a small startup to a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) acquisition target, to a public company accused by many of being nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Since its November 2011 IPO, Groupon has lost over 81% (as of this writing) of its value, as the reality of the company's business failed to match the hype. But Groupon near $5 is a far different stock than Groupon at $20. And for long-term, patient investors, we believe that shares of Groupon are a buy. For the record, unless otherwise noted, financial figures and management commentary will be derived from 3 sources: Groupon's Q2 2012 earnings release, its latest 10-Q, or its earnings conference call.Q2 2012 Overview: Looking at Headlines is Not EnoughGroupon's latest round of stock malaise was sparked by its Q2 2012 earnings release. Buried within it was the fact that in Q2, Groupon's gross billings (the total $ value of its deals sold) shrank sequentially from Q1. While Q2 2012 gross billings of $1.29 billion were up 38.829% from Q2 2011, they were down 4.797% from Q1 2011 (in fairness to Groupon, currency volatility reduced Q2 2012 gross billings by $75 million). The sequential rise in Groupon's revenue was due to continued growth in the company's new Groupon Goods business. Groupon lost over a fifth of its value after posting its Q2 earnings, as investors fretted about growth and the company's continued direction, even if revenues grew by 44.8% year-over-year, and the company posted a GAAP profit of 4 cents per share. Groupon's Q3 outlook calls for revenues of $580-$620 million (representing growth of 35-44% year-over-year) and operating income of $15-$35 million (compared to a loss of $0.2 million a year ago). Based on the midpoints of Groupon's guidance, revenues will grow 5.572% sequentially, and operating income will drop 46.219%, reflecting planned investments Groupon will make in its international business, which we discuss below.Groupon's earnings call yielded a great deal of insight into the reasons why gross billings declined, as well as what the company plans to do about this issue. Groupon's decline in sequential billings and billings growth were caused by weakness in Europe, which forms the core of Groupon's international business (international revenues comprise 54.22% of Groupon's total revenues). On the call, CEO Andrew Mason explained that the company's European deals have, on average, higher price points than its North American deals, stating that, ""these more discretionary offers are more susceptible to negative demand elasticity over the past few quarters as macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated."" While macro issues did indeed play a part in Groupon's European weakness, the company does have levers to pull when it comes to defending against such weakness. Over the past several quarters, Groupon has rolled out various technological improvements within its North American operations, improvements that enable better deal personalization and better merchant campaign tools, which are crucial in retaining merchants. We believe that while Groupon is somewhat exposed to macroeconomic stress in Europe, the stock's steep post-earnings selloff has priced in most of that weakness. Furthermore, Groupon sees mobile, a sector that has plagued many social companies, as a way to strengthen its European (as well as overall international) position. Groupon's mobile application is the #3 shopping app in the United States, and CEO Andrew Mason stated on the company's conference call that mobile users spend 50% more on Groupon's than traditional desktop users. Mason declined to state how long the company would be in investment mode related to its international business. But, he did say that Q3 guidance takes this into account, and that Groupon is looking to integrate its 6 various technology platforms so that improvements can be deployed much quicker than they are today. There is risk that margins may be pressured in the short-term (the company's GAAP operating margin was 8.179% in Q2 2012), but we believe that integrating Groupon's technology platforms is the right long-term move.It is true that on a GAAP basis, Groupon's gross billings declined sequentially this quarter. And it is also true that Groupon's year-over-year billings growth has slowed. But it has slowed from 108% in Q1 2012 to 47% in Q2 2012, which is still an impressive growth rate. And in our view, billings growth alone cannot be used to paint a bullish or bearish picture of Groupon. It would be as if Intel's success were measured solely on the number of chips it sells. Without taking into account things such as margins, or the percentage of each deal that Groupon takes, this metric means little. On a year-over year basis, Groupon posted a non-GAAP operating margin of 12.7%, compared to a non-GAAP operating margin of -15.9% a year ago. While growth has slowed year-over-year, profits have arrived. We believe that in the long run, investors will come to realize that in this case, extracting higher profits from a slower-growing company is better than chasing every penny of revenue growth while ignoring the bottom line.Taxes: Another Lever for Groupon to PullIn the prior segment, we discussed the ""levers"" that Groupon has to strengthen its European and international business, which can serve as a defense against macroeconomic stress in those markets. In the long run, those technology investments should lead to increased profits. But, there is another lever that Groupon can pull, one that many investors have overlooked: taxes. In Q2 2012, Groupon's tax rate was a stunning 66.593%. Of Groupon's $100.424 million in pre-tax income, $66.875 million was set aside for income taxes. Had Groupon paid even the statutory rate of 35%, GAAP profit would have come in at 9 cents per share, more than double the reported 4 cents in profit. We can think of few companies that pay such a high tax rate. On the call, CFO Jason Child said that at this point in time, the company is unable to use net operating losses to offset tax payments in profitable countries. However, Child did say that the company expects its tax rate to decline ""meaningfully"" over time, as it implements its international tax strategies. We do not think that Groupon will be paying taxes at a rate of over 66% in perpetuity. In the quarters to come, this rate should come down, and those savings will flow straight through to Groupon's bottom line.Merchant Satisfaction and Accounting Practices: Decoding the Truth and Evaluating the UpsideEver since Groupon was founded, there has been one overarching question in every debate regarding the company: does it help merchants? We believe that the answer is that on average, Groupon does indeed help merchants. Is it true that for some merchants Groupons are a failure? Yes. And it is also true that for some, they are a wild success. The reports regarding merchant satisfaction tend to focus on both extremes, and the reality, as always, lies somewhere in the middle. It is impossible for Groupon, or any other company for that matter, to satisfy 100% of its customers 100% of the time. Such expectations are unrealistic. As long as Groupon satisfies a majority of its merchant partners the majority of the time, things will be fine. Studies commissioned by Groupon and conducted by ForSee (alongside independent studies the firm did) show that Groupon has a score of 79 on ForSee's merchant satisfaction index. The average for all B2B companies included in the study was 64. Groupon beat the Fortune 500 by 10 points.Groupon's Q2 conference call, however, showed that in Europe, Groupon's merchant satisfaction score was 25 points lower than here in the United States. Raising that score, by striking the proper balance between merchant and consumer value, will lead directly to increases in Groupon's revenues. We expect more color on this issue in Groupon's Q3 report, and believe that improving merchant satisfaction is another way to strengthen the company's international business. On Monday, September 17, Groupon fell nearly 10%, with the losses driven by a merchant survey released by Raymond James. The firm conducted a survey of more than 100 merchants, and its results showed that while 53% of merchants were either satisfied or very satisfied, a third were unsatisfied, and that 39% are ""unlikely"" to run a Groupon deal within the next few years. Frankly, we do not see this survey as being representative of the overall Groupon merchant experience. Groupon had more than 100,000 merchant partners at the end of Q2, and we do not think that surveying 0.1% of the company's merchant base can give a wholly accurate picture of the sentiment that Groupon's merchant partners have toward the company. Still, we believe that Groupon needs to communicate the value it brings to merchants more clearly. The company is not being given the benefit of the doubt by the markets, and Groupon needs to do all it can to dispel the rumors that surround it.We would like to turn now to Groupon's merchant accounting practices, an issue we discussed in detail in our last article on the company. In this article, we will focus on Groupon's accounting practices this quarter, as well as in the quarters beyond (readers who would like a more detailed overview of the company's accounting may turn to our previous article, which is linked to above). As a reminder, Groupon has 2 merchant payment models, which are outlined in its 10-Q filings with the SEC.A cursory reading of these 2 models makes it clear which model is better for Groupon. Under the redemption model, Groupon sends cash out the door only when Groupon's are actually used. Under the fixed payment model, merchants are paid within 60 days, redemption or no redemption. Groupon is slowly rolling out its fixed payment model to its international markets, but CFO Jason Child made it clear that the company will not make the transition overnight. He stated on the earnings call that, ""While rolling out changes to payment terms of merchants in our international business is something that we believe can further enhance the merchant value proposition, the transition will occur on a deal-by-deal basis and with appropriate level of consideration to customer experience and credit risk management. Over time, we do expect working capital to continue to be a meaningful driver of our cash flow."" Groupon posted operating cash flow of $75.315 million in Q2 2012, up 93.012% from Q2 2011, driven by changes in working capital as well as depreciation and amortization. Interestingly, stock-based compensation (which is added back into operating cash flow) declined by 30.048% to $27.084 million. Analysts pressed CFO Jason Child as to how the company's changing merchant payment practices would affect the company's cash flow. Child responded that in Q3, working capital's contribution to operating cash flow should remain at about the same ratio as it does today. Child reminded analysts that this process will not happen over the course of a single quarter, but rather many quarters. Child stated on the call that the company will keep analysts and investors updated on the company's merchant payment models and practices. We believe that worries regarding cash flows were much more material in the company's early days. But now that Groupon has $1.185798 billion in cash & equivalents on its balance sheet (and that excludes $131.177 million in equity investments), the company is in much better shape to weather a change in cash flows. And in our view, the transition to a fixed payment model across all of the company's international markets will help increase overall merchant satisfaction, which will, in the end, lead to higher cash flows. Groupon is continuing to strengthen its accounting team, and hired Brian Stevens as its Chief Accounting Officer earlier this month. Stevens joins the company from KPMG, where he worked for 16 years, most recently as an audit partner.Competition: Not as Easy as it SeemsA central tenet of the thesis against Groupon has been that there are no barriers to entry in this industry. The conventional wisdom seems to be that anyone can set up a website and begin selling daily deals. But the truth is that it is not that easy. Groupon ended Q2 2012 with 12,820 employees, and that number grew 33.195% from Q2 2011 and 2.168% sequentially. It takes thousands of employees to do what Groupon does, and to succeed in the daily deals industry, it will take much more than just a website. It is true that Groupon's competitors include companies such as Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But simply because Groupon competes against such companies does not mean that it will fail. Groupon is working hard to strengthen its relationships with both merchants and consumers. On the company's conference call, CEO Andrew Mason stated that Groupon Rewards, the company's customer loyalty program, now has 6,000 merchant partners and over 1.5 million subscribers enrolled. And 20% of merchants are suing at least one of the company's merchant tools, such as Groupon Scheduler, Groupon Now!, or Groupon Rewards. As we stated in our last article on Groupon, it is impossible for Groupon, or any daily deals company, to have the perfect deal for each subscriber each and every day. As long as Groupon has, on average, the best deals in the industry, we believe the company can come out ahead. And according to industry reports, that is in fact a distinct possibility. Sources close to Google indicate that the company has laid off a large portion of its staff at its German subsidiary DailyDeal, due to an inability to gain traction in that market.Analyst Estimates, Valuations, and a Word Regarding Their RoleStocks prices often become unhinged from the fundamentals of the underlying company, and can deviate from them, both to the upside and the downside. At $20 per share (the price at which Groupon priced its IPO), the price was unhinged to the upside (whether or not Groupon should have priced its IPO at that level is beyond the scope of this article; a higher stock price would bring in more cash for the company, but also makes it harder to sustain the share price). And at around $5, we believe that the price is unhinged to the downside.As of this writing, analysts expect Groupon to post EPS of 37 cents per share, which would give Groupon a P/E ratio of 12.838x 2013 earnings, hardly overvalued for a company projected to grow earnings at a rate of 117.647% in 2013.And yet, analysts had forecast 2013 EPS of 70 cents per share back in June when our last article on Groupon was published. While we admit that Groupon's Q2 results could have been better, were they really so terrible as to warrant a 47.143% cut in 2013 earnings estimates? Has Groupon's business really worsened by nearly half in the span of a few months? We do not think that it has. And such seemingly dire cuts in earnings forecasts stand in stark contrast to analyst price targets. After Groupon posted its Q2 results, Citi slashed its price target from $19 to $9. And JPMorgan cut its target to $8. Both firms cited Groupon's quarterly results as reasons that their old price targets were unwarranted. And yet, these price targets imply that under $5, Groupon shares have tremendous upside. Based on the company's stock price of $4.75 as of the close of trading on September 17, Citi's price target implies upside of 89.474%, and JPMorgan's implies upside of 68.421%. The exception to this is Ken Sena of Evercore Partner. Frankly, his ratings revisions regarding Groupon are a bit puzzling. After the company posted its Q2 earnings, he cut his price target to $6.50. As of today, that target stands at $3. What exactly has changed over the course of the past month? Has Groupon's business really deteriorated that badly?Investors need to remember that at the end of the day, analysts do not provide facts. They provide opinion. While we do not buy into the idea that analysts exist solely to defraud retail investors, we do believe that their reports need to be taken with a grain of salt. When Groupon first went public, analysts may have been too optimistic. Even we will admit that it is tough to see how Groupon is worth $20 per share based on current fundamentals. But, those same fundamentals imply a share price higher than $4.75. Groupon's Q2 report may not have been ideal, but did it really warrant a nearly 50% cut in estimates? We do not think so, and think that analysts are switching from excess optimism to excess pessimism, a situation that may set the stage for an upside surprise in the quarters to come.Microsoft and Groupon: A History LessonCritics of Groupon will no doubt view any comparison between that company and a blue-chip company such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as deeply offensive and insulting to Microsoft. How can a worthless company such as Groupon be compared to the enormously profitable Microsoft? We are not making an argument that the 2 companies have similar profit potential or should be seen as equals when it comes to financial condition. Rather, we are comparing how the two companies were perceived in their early years. In this instance, there are some similarities.Both Microsoft and Groupon ushered in new industries. Groupon was crucial in launching the daily deals industry, and Microsoft was instrumental in launching the personal computing revolution, and helped lay the foundations of a good deal of the technology that we use today. In hindsight, it seems foolish that anyone could question the business potential of Microsoft. Yet in the company's early years, it was met with skepticism. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's current CEO and the company's 30th employee, recounted in an interview with Forbes that his parents were deeply skeptical of this new software company, one that he dropped out of the Stanford Graduate School of Business to join. Steve Ballmer stated that when he told his parents that he was leaving Stanford for Microsoft, his father asked him what software was. And his mother didn't understand why anyone would actually want a computer. In hindsight, those questions may seem foolish. But at the time, people did not grasp the potential that Microsoft had. It takes time to understand, evaluate, and value a new industry. It took time for Microsoft, and it will take time for Groupon. The daily deals industry is still relatively new, and investors need to examine it without prejudice or emotion. We believe that in time, people will come to accept the long-term potential of daily deals and local commerce. And we believe that as the leading daily deals and local commerce company, Groupon stands to benefit from the growth of these industries more than any other company.ConclusionsWe continue to believe that Groupon's best days are ahead of it. Groupon is a misunderstood company, and there are a number of issues that investors need to understand when it comes to this company. But, we believe that the markets are unduly punishing Groupon. While the company may not be worth $20 per share, we believe it is worth a good deal more than $5. And at under 13x estimated 2013 earnings, we find it hard to see Groupon's shares as overvalued, and think that there is far too much pessimism surrounding this company. The market is offering investors an excellent deal on shares of Groupon. We have taken the deal, and believe that in the long run, other investors that do the same will be rewarded for their convictions.Disclosure: I am long GRPN, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT.

845651,28701,2012-09-04T15:58:33-04:00,,"It is hard to find anyone that loves or even likes Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) these days. The company can't catch a break -- take a look at what Bloomberg reported Friday:The only problem is that Chairman Eric Lefkofsky transferred 18.7 million of his company's shares to early investors, consultants, and advisers. One of the recipients was his Lefkofsky Family Foundation, which funds programs focused on education, human rights, medical research, and the arts. Recipients include Teach for America, Human Rights Watch, Planned Parenthood of Illinois, the Mayo Clinic, and the Art Institute of Chicago. If this is called ""dumping shares,"" we can only hope the corporate executives of America follow Lefkofsky's lead. Fortunately, Bloomberg corrected its mistake, but I wonder how many will remember the false headline.Why is there so much hate toward this former darling of the Internet space? The stock's performance certainly has not helped Groupon's cause. Since its IPO at $20 the stock is now down a dismal 79.25%. Groupon's high of $31.14 is reflecting a loss of 86.7% from its peak this year.Click to enlarge images.It wasn't too long ago that everyone wanted a piece of Groupon. Bloomberg reported in November 2010:The same day the New York Times reported:This is the same Mayer who is 37 years old and worth a reported $300 million. She is now the CEO of Yahoo (YHOO), which offered $2 billion for Groupon, according to the New York Times.Why didn't Groupon take the $6 billion? In Frank Sennett's book, Groupon's Biggest Deal Ever, the three main reasons are:What happened next? Groupon raised $700 million at $20, which translated into a $12.8 billion valuation. At the time it certainly looked like the IPO was the right call for the company. Then the floor fell out of the stock as shares have plummeted to the current price of $4.15. With 653.68 million shares outstanding, the market capitalization is now $2.71 billion.Despite the relatively low market cap, there has been analysts stating their worries about Groupon's weak business plan, low barriers to entry, and a host of other complaints. Has that much changed since Google and Yahoo tried to buy Groupon?I believe the geniuses at Google and Mayer at Yahoo understand Groupon and its business model completely. If Groupon was worth paying $6 billion for, why is it not worth $3 billion to $5 billion now?Groupon is estimated to produce over 2.3 billion in sales for 2012. Net income estimates for 2012 are $0.18 per share, or $117 million. 2013 earnings are estimated to be $0.37 per share, or $241 million. The current valuation of $2.71 billion is 23 times 2012 earnings and 11.2 times 2013 earnings estimates. There is an extra $700 million in the bank thanks to the IPO. Why is Groupon a worse company now compared to when Google tried to buy it?In the past 15 trading days, the stock has been down 14 days and unchanged for one day. Is the pessimism too much? We certainly think so.If you add the volume up for the past 15 days, the total is 284 million shares. Groupon's total float is 252 million, which means the float has turned over. This is important because float turnover indicates new money in a stock. Many of the shareholders who bought at higher levels have had plenty of time to throw in the towel and sell their shares. The new buyers of the 252 million shares have not absorbed the losses the early investors have had to endure.Now if these new shareholders hold and don't sell, this will lead to less supply. Less supply and higher demand will lead to a greater stock price. With over 46 million shares short, there will not be a lack of demand if sentiment starts to turn Groupon's way.Disclosure: I am long GRPN.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
839071,24582,2012-08-30T16:33:25-04:00,,"The term ""worthless,"" I suppose, is up for interpretation. The most logical definition in regards to stocks, however, seems to be businesses that don't generate any positive free cash flow for their owners. Consequently, since these businesses don't provide a positive rate of return for their shareholders (thereby earning a negative economic, or real return), they are bound to be liquidated or sold to a firm that sees a strategic acquisition opportunity.As of now, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is in fact cash flow positive, but the quality of said cash flows are exceptionally poor and they are unlikely to be sustained.Quality Of Cash FlowsFrom Groupon's most recent 10-Q:Income Statement While income from operations was in fact up 87% to $86 million, this growth was more than offset by an astounding increase in the share count. Largely a result of the company's SBC, or share-based compensation program, the diluted share count has risen relentlessly since the company went public.At the end of 2011, there were 362 million shares outstanding, compared to today's figure of 663 million. The end of the lock-up period drastically added to the float, and the stock has been sinking ever since; a major hangover effect from the artificially low supply.The SBC program raises some serious concerns. These types of lucrative compensation plans can work sufficiently well for management (but oftentimes not the shareholders) if the company is solidly profitable and a performing share price. When the share price collapses, as Groupon's has, employees begin to worry about their compensation and it may be difficult to retain a talented marketing team - a factor that GRPN is wholly dependent on.The takeaway from the income statement is that while top-line growth is impressive, management practices regarding its approach to shareholder dilution is extremely detrimental to the value of the business on a per-share basis.Cash FlowsStock-based compensation accounted for more than 100% of the OCF for the six month period ended June 30th, 2011. 33% of the OCF, and almost 50% of the FCF, for the six months ended June 30th, 2012 was also derived from SBC.With nearly 50% of free cash flows currently coming from the issuance of stock options, investors in Groupon need rapid, quality income growth just to offset the share dilution, let alone grow shareholder value.As Groupon's stock falls, it will be difficult to continue issuing options at the current pace, since the compensation is less attractive and potentially at risk of falling under various execution prices.The last four quarters have produced about $320 million in free cash flow, but if we deduct SBC, FCF is closer to $210 million (35% lower). With a current market capitalization of $2.8 billion, GRPN is trading at 13.3 times my adjusted FCF. While this valuation isn't unreasonable on a historical basis, the quality of these cash flows and chances for long-term viability of the business are poor.Business Practices And EconomicsI highly recommend this article to readers. The report argues that Groupon is really a sub-prime lender, rather than a coupon or ""daily deals"" company. When you think about how the company does its business, this description makes far more sense.From the article:Groupon also doesn't account very well for potential refunds - a trend that is set to get much worse. The company's restatement was largely a result of higher than anticipated refund requests. As the company ramps up it Groupons business for higher-value items, particularly travel related services, refund requests will pick up significantly since 1) more expensive Groupons incentivize requests much more than coupons of low-value and 2) many of these groupons do a poor job of disclosing the restrictions and fine-print.Groupon may have a very difficult time maintaining and adding new merchant partners over the next few years. The merchants who participate in the Groupon program are often desperate to sell the product in question or generate business at the expense of profitability. These partners may enjoy the increased revenue growth from Groupon users, but the cost of the commission and discount price make the service a last-resort option.In regards to barriers to entry, the popular opinion is that there are none in the daily deals business. While they are certainly very minimal, I concede that Groupon appears to have the most popular product and entrenched network. That being said, there are enough competitors out there (Google, Yahoo, LivingSocial, local papers etc.) that nip at Groupon's business and eliminate overall pricing power. This dynamic makes it nearly impossible for Groupon to pass on higher costs (in the form of commissions) to its partners, and also highlights the lack of a scalable business.As Groupon expands, it must grow its sales infrastructure. This is reflected in the 60% increase in SGA costs for the six month period ended in 2Q 2012. Given the level of activity in the industry, the commissions it gives to the sales staff must be competitive. The travel, communication, and payroll costs are no small expense either.So, Why Is Groupon ""Worthless?""At its core, Groupon is a non-scalable business with little pricing power and understated liabilities in the form of refund risks. To make matters worse, management compensates employees with stock options that are extremely dilutive to shareholders. This SBC is a significant portion of operating cash flows, despite the fact that it actually erodes value.Over time, Groupon's lack of internal controls and dangerous venture into big-ticket coupons are going to result in huge unexpected losses. The accounting discrepancies the investment community has already seen may not have been physically large, but indicate that if management was to adequately account for its liabilities, the cash flow generation of the business would be far lower, if not negative (especially when accounting for money owed to merchants).If unexpected losses don't get Groupon, the loss of struggling merchant partners, a non scalable business, low barriers to entry, and poor pricing power will. Investors often like to criticize Amazon for its huge costs related to its expansion. The difference with Amazon is that the elevated infrastructure expenses it is incurring today is truly a temporary issue; the company has a real possibility of being able to deliver anywhere in the US within a day or two, wiping out local competitors in the process and generating drastically improved pricing power and margins.Groupon, on the other hand, will always have rapidly growing SGA costs-at least as long as it wants to grow top-line revenues. While Amazon has a choice regarding its CAPEX costs, Groupon has no such choice regarding its soaring SGA costs.In conclusion, Groupon does not have a viable business strategy, unacceptably dilutes its shareholders, and will never be ""wildly profitable"" as its CEO once exclaimed. In fact, Groupon will never be very profitable at all, and we all know what happens to companies who don't make much money.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

808241,33211,2012-08-15T05:15:41-04:00,,"The roster for recent IPO earnings this second quarter has been anything but catch and release. Investors who went short or boldly bought put options before earnings hooked a number of whales.Since Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) May 18th IPO, the stock has fallen by more 46%. Last month Facebook debuted its first reported revenue and earnings. After the report the stock skidded to new lows. As you can see in the chart below, Facebook stock which was previously trading at $29.49 hit a 52 week low of $19.82. Facebook stock served as a big profit maker for option strategies and short traders.Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), the social media game maker of Mafia Wars, FarmVille, Zynga Poker and other games, has plunged by 70% since it offering of 100 million shares at $10 in mid-December. In the chart below, Zynga stock traded $5.08/share before earnings and after earnings price slid to $3.00 share. Those who were bold enough to short Zynga ahead of second quarter earnings netted a 50% return, and option traders profited by 131% utilizing a strangle.Cafe Press (NASDAQ:PRSS), an internet company that caters to consumers of personalized T-shirts, coffee mugs and other gift items, has seen a decline of more than 50% since its IPO in March of this year. Its offer price was $19 and the stock is now trading at $9 and change. Last month its earnings brought the stock to $7.68/share. Shorts were able to return nearly a 50% single day return.This negative trend of recent IPO social media's earnings have been especially devastating to one of the only ETFs to target the space, the Global X Social Media Index (NASDAQ:SOCL). Below is a chart for Global X ETF, shows the fund once again headed for lower prices. In less than a month shorts were able profit handsomely with a 15% return.In a similar fashion, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) the online coupon distributor missed its expected revenue and the stock took more than a 25% clipping. Since its $20 IPO debut last year, Groupon shares are down by more than 70%. Yesterday, Groupon stock closed at $7.55/share, and after second quarter earnings the shares traded $5.48.In a earnings climate like we are having, stocks can lead to incredible gains for aggressive options traders. Often times many stock options traders go fishing for the big catch, and every once in awhile they hook a trophy fish with a little minnow. One way to catch a big fish with a little minnow is to either bait the hook with a long call or a long put strategy.In stock options, a long put position becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock depreciates relative to the strike price. The profit potential for trading a long put is considerable, and the original investment is the only potential loss. A long put is simply the purchase of one or more option contracts (1 contract = 100 shares).As a trader you use a long put option when you are bearish on a particular stock or market direction. You can also use a long put strategy if you believe the markets could become volatile in the near future. Purchasing put options is a different way to profit from a bearish market without buying shares of stocks. Implementing long put strategy is not difficult at all.To take advantage of Groupon's missed earnings I will explain how to trade a long put option strategy. Groupon Inc. -- closed at $7.55/share -- Below is a calendar of Groupon options expiring at the market close Friday, August 17, 2012.To employ the long put option strategy, a trader enters in one single put position. In this example, Groupon closed at $7.55 August 13, 2012. The previous five days Groupon shares ranged from $6.60 to $7.90. The uncertain direction of Groupon shares increased volatility and added an expense to my put contracts purchase. However, uncertainty surrounding Groupon's earnings is why I made a 100% return.The options I traded expired at the close on Friday, August 17, 2012. Given the time frame, this is a very high risk trade with a rather substantial return. Therefore, the investment in this trade should be manageable. I spent a total of $700 to execute the long put strategy.To employ the long put strategy using Groupon shares, I traded one option position -- one call. I purchased 10 contracts (1 contract = 100 shares) for a put position. The put was for a $7.00 strike price and costs $700 ($0.70 per option contract x 100 shares x 10 contracts).I had ten contracts for August 17, 2012 -- 7.00 put that cost $700 -- you have the right (meaning you can close the trade at anytime no matter the price of a stock) to sell 100 shares (100 shares = 1 contract) of Groupon until August 17, 2012.With shares of Groupon decreasing below $6.00/share (August. 14, 2012), I placed a sell order for $1.40 a contract equal to $1,400 ($1.40 per option contract x 100 shares x 10 contracts) So subtracting the option value, $1,400, from the original investment, $700, I net a total gain of $700 -- a 100% Groupon Coupon ReturnYou might also want to study other option strategies before attempting to clip big discounts on stocks.

811811,30961,2012-08-16T11:32:41-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) just recently reported its most recent quarter; investors are shooting first and asking questions later. The stock has been a battleground for debate as investors grapple with the business model, barriers to entry and daily-deal fatigue. Is the selling warranted?Take Rate Remains PositiveOne of the big arguments against Groupon was their margins should come under pressure due to the growing competitor base and low barriers to entry. Every little start up across the country would challenge Groupon's payout and force them to take a lesser percentage of the pie.Unlike many bears anticipated, this has not unfolded. The take rate has been a rare positive for the company, as they are holding firm and even trending up since the trough at 37% last year. The historical average points to a take rate of around 41%, and it is imperative they continue to trend upward or at least flat in this department. Here's a look at Take Rates from the MRQ back through 2010. I should note that the current figure does not account for direct revenue (65.4m). Without that it bumps to 44%, but doesn't paint the actual picture.Inaccurate Cash Balance ReportsOne of the biggest issues I have with GRPN management is how they report cash balances. They tout the nearly $1.2 billion they have in cash, but what they don't ""headline"" to investors is the amount in which is owed to merchants. Take this quarter for instance: the company has $1,400m in total current assets. In the same breath, they have a build up of $1,100m in current liabilities. These liabilities include: accrued expenses, accrued merchant payables, accrued accounts payable, etc. The bulk of the $1.1b is money OWED to merchants.Whenever customers buy a GRPN voucher, they pay GRPN directly. GRPN then pays out the merchant over the next 60-90 days (it really depends on the type of deal each merchant has worked out). So what good does it do for GRPN to boast about $1.2 billion in cash when the majority of it is not even THEIR cash? In order to peg the true value of GRPN's cash position, you must deduct ""current"" liabilities, from ""current"" assets. When doing so, it paints a different picture. Here are the following figures starting from Q1 2011.As you can see, GRPN has been burning cash for the last 6 quarters, NOT cash-flow-positive as they promote. Granted, things have slowed in the last 2 quarters as they have reduced marketing spend and (kind of) reeled in expenses. All in all, they do have a decent amount in cash ($300m) and no real debt to speak of.Growth in Active Customers SlowingAnother previous bright spot was active customer growth, until now. Active customers grew at the slowest pace sequentially in its history, up a mere 3%, or 1.1m to 38.0 million. I think Groupon is too young a company to see a decline in customer counts, but it is clear that they are no longer seeing hyper growth. A more important tool I like to look at is the amount of net revenue each active customer produces. It looks as though average spend is basing somewhere around $15.Stock-Based CompensationThe other major issue I have with this company is its SBC practices. Its one thing for companies that are making piles of money to offer such lucrative programs, but in this case, Groupon is putting its SBC program ahead of shareholders. This year alone, SBC will knock off $.21 - $.25 a share which doesn't seem like much until you consider they are only making $.15 and projected to make $.40- $.50 next year. The need to stop using their stock as a currency.Forward ProjectionsMoving forward, I don't see the hyper growth within this space. We are in a world where AC's could only grow at 1-2% QoQ, which will lead to 7-8% growth YoY. Unless GRPN can figure out a way to get current customers to spend more, they will struggle to grow at the rapid pace in which they are accustomed. Its clear the drop in marketing spend has hurt its customer growth, and they are in no position to ramp that back up.2013 - AC's growing to 42.2m- $2,487 Net Revenue- $.41/shr Non-GAAP EPS2014- AC's growing to 43.9m- $2,594 Net Revenue- $.49/shr Non GAAP EPSThe above projections assume that QoQ trend in AC's continue slowing as they have been the last year, a 41% take rate and AC spend to maintain its $15 mark.I personally believe there is upside to these numbers because Groupon NOW! will be a successful tool when rolled out and expanded to more areas. Groupon NOW! is the mobile platform dream, and GRPN could find themselves in a unique position to take advantage of mobile unlike many of its tech counterparts. Groupon Goods seems to be doing very well also, so it's not all negative.In ConclusionThere is some value in this name. They are the best in breed daily deals name and the company that the majority of people associate the space with. That alone offers some value to the name. Not many startups can duplicate the size and scale that Groupon has. They have no debt, and although they are cash flow negative by my standards, cash is not a problem. In general, its hard to put a multiple on this name because of so many factors.At 12-13x '13 earnings, it brings us to $5.00 - $5.35, which is about where we are now. Why wade in? Until they prove they have staying power, show willingness put shareholders first instead of employees and shore up the accounting issues I'm not paying up at these levels.Do I think they go to zero? No, at the moment, I do not. I'm just waiting for a massive capitulation into the low 4s or some sign of clarity among management. Until either happens, I'll be happy to watch this one unfold from the cheap seats.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
752701,31451,2012-07-26T14:14:09-04:00,,"Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), the maker of social media games on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and mobile phone platforms, released its quarterly earnings July 25th and shocked investors with just a $0.01 profit after items, well short of the expected $0.05 profit. On news of that announcement, Facebook, the primary platform for Zynga's games, tumbled 6%. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) also lost 7% on the announcement, falling during early trading to $6.67. This brings up the following question: Why would an online discount voucher, retailer, and local e-commerce leader like Groupon go down sharply because a digital game maker saw disappointing results?The answer? A witch hunt stock market that is trading on emotion and over-correlating results across industries. It's the epitome of a depressed market that often signals a bottom -- a nervous, jittery market that is taking out only loosely related companies with spurious business correlation.Not that the market was treating Groupon based on its fundamentals before the earnings release by Zynga. When assessing the performance of the company since last November, which is down 73%, it appears reasonable to ask whether there is a more unloved stock in the United States markets than Groupon.Click to enlarge images.The eccentricities of management have no doubt contributed to the shaky reputation of the company in the public markets. From what many considered to be an insensitive television advertisement during the Super Bowl that forced an apology from the CEO to its recent offer of home turndown service in its hometown of Chicago, Groupon has always been characterized as a non-traditional company willing to push boundaries.Like many investors, I initially believed the negative assessments would send me steering wide and clear of Groupon. The news in April that accounting irregularities related to return-loss provisions would require adjustments and possible restatements made me even more cautious. For months since the announcement of return-loss provisions, the stock has continued a long and sustained slide from $18 to $7, with investors even shrugging off first-quarter results that far exceeded estimates.Upon performing due diligence, the resulting low valuation and positive long-term fundamentals allow the negative bias to give way to a significant level of optimism and belief that this may be the most misunderstood company in the public markets.Groupon is arguably the fastest growing company in U.S. history. The company, begun by CEO Andrew Mason and founder Lefskoky just five years ago in Chicago, has grown from $330 million to $1.6 billion in sales in just two years. The company has encountered growing pains as it has invested in the systems to support that growth and the very aggressive future growth projections of analysts, which anticipate the company growing to $3.07 billion in revenue in FY 2013.The growing pains encountered by Groupon have called many to question the timing of the public offering. Certainly, the company may have benefit from additional seasoning prior to going public. However, companies going public are able to quickly build up a low-cost war chest that allows them to make significant investments in the business. That war chest remains on Groupon's balance sheet in the form of $1.16 billion of cash, which is 25% of the total market capitalization of the company. While Groupon has held off on major acquisitions, it has made eight small acquisitions that have enhanced its travel and customer information applications for mobile devices.Groupon has positioned itself to be a technology leader for local retailers, those relatively small and powerless retailers that suffer high banking fees and that often don't have sufficient technology prowess or budgets to present an online presence. Groupon has significant competitive advantages. It has first-mover advantage, which allowed the company to build brand awareness that has resulted in strong subscriber growth to its daily deals service throughout its history. It is building on this customer base through its rapidly growing Groupon Goods retail application, which has limited duration offers of products at heavily discounted prices. Its relationship with small retailers in local markets will hold the key to its future success. In May, Groupon instituted Groupon Rewards, a program that rewards customers and merchants with an easy-to-use loyalty reward functionality.Groupon is exceedingly cheap from a fundamental perspective. At just under $7 per share the company trades at just a $4.4 billion market capitalization, which is just $3.5 billion net of cash. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is just 10.3, which is tremendously low for a company that grew trailing revenues over 500% during FY 2011 and which current analysts anticipate will grow revenues by 50% during FY 2012 alone. If the company simply meets analyst expectations for revenue growth during the current FY, the shares have 50% upside. Continuing to meet guidance and estimates through FY 2013 will provide 100% upside on the shares, even without expanding the price/sales or price/earnings metrics. However, the company executing on its projections would likely cause both increased investor confidence and a short squeeze that could lead to far higher pricing for the shares on an absolute and fundamental level.Aug. 13th will prove to be a pivotal moment for Groupon. Due to the weakness in other Internet firm results, shares of Groupon do not have a catalyst until the next earnings report. However, that report will have the potential for explosive upside if Groupon meets its conservative revenue estimates of $550 million to $590 million for the quarter that were disseminated in its Q1 2012 conference call. The results for Q2 will allow the company to make good on its promises, and provide a large upside catalyst to the share price by validating current analyst estimates.Disclosure: I am long GRPN."
804531,24631,2012-08-13T22:21:56-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reported Q2 results yesterday.Key highlights:What I liked: Profitability reaches an inflection point; Deal Customization gains tractionAs I mentioned in my earnings preview (view report), Groupon is on a steady path towards profitability. GAAP EPS came in at $0.04 per share, beating average analyst estimate of $0.02 loss per share.Rising profitability can be credited to lower operating expense. I note that marketing spend as a percentage of revenue, a key operating cost for group-buy companies, has declined to 15% from 54% in 2Q11.Going forward, Groupon's profitability will continue to expand due to increasing scale which will further lowering the operating expense.Another point that I was especially positive about was Groupon's Deal-Customization. Over the past six months, Groupon increased the size of its deal bank by more than 10 times to 8,000 deals from 600. Deal customization is positively affecting the company's brand awareness and user base. In Q2, active customers numbered 38 million, a 65% y/y increase.Larger number of customized local deals will greatly reduce deal-fatigue that result from Groupon's daily emails because relevant deals that closely match users' interests will most likely spur purchases that translate to continued revenue growth.According to management, Groupon will reach $2 billion in revenue and $5 in gross booking at the current run rate.Finally, Groupon has $1.2 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. While the company is currently focusing on making strategic investments to build its business, the current cash pile, coupled with addiitonal quarter of cash generation, makes future share buy-back a real possbility.What concerned me: Revenue missGroupon's revenue of $568 million came in lower than the consensus of $573 million, partially due to weak macro environment in Europe and FX. While North America revenue was especially robust with 66% y/y growth, International sale grew only 31% y/y. A majority of Groupon's International sale comes from Europe, where the company will likely to continue face a combination of macro and FX headwinds. This is a major concern given that International revenue accounts for over half of Groupon's total revenue in Q2 and continued weakness abroad may translate to future revenue misses.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
804881,22762,2012-08-14T04:29:10-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenThere was once probably a good reason for why Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) needed to expand aggressively internationally when it did, buying up other daily deal operations, for fast, inorganic growth. But on Monday's Q2 earnings call, those reasons didn't really come up, with CEO Andrew Mason instead providing a lengthy explanation for why international, led by Europe, hasn't been performing very well for the company - growing by 31% while North America grew at twice that rate to 66%.The reasons, Mason said, were threefold: in Europe (the bulk of Groupon's intl business) the Groupon offers were too expensive for consumers; merchants weren't as happy with the service; and because of integration issues, Groupon hasn't been able to implement some of the technology it has developed to lure in more users. But on a wider level, he also noted that people on the street in Europe still don't have much of a clue of what Groupon actually is.Pricing. Mason noted that Groupon deals, and their prices, were being pitched at a level higher than in the U.S., and that this hasn't matched up with how consumers are spending money at the moment in the region. (Pricing and current buying behavior was something also raised by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it was explaining its muted performance in the region.)Merchants. Businesses, meanwhile, seem to be facing a knock-on effect from those high prices. They're finding that their products aren't being purchased as quickly as before, or as Mason put it: ""merchants simply weren't seeing the same value as they are in the U.S."" This is making them disgruntled, so much so that in surveys Groupon receives satisfaction ratings that are 25% lower in Europe than it does in the U.S., he noted. Mason didn't mention it on the call, but the regulatory investigations in countries like the UK, which pinpointed areas where Groupon needed to improve its communications with merchants (which it did), may have also had an impact on satisfaction rating.sTech. The third issue Mason cited was technology, specifically that Groupon hasn't been ""leveraging [its] technology in Europe."" What does that mean, exactly? Groupon doesn't have as big a bag of tricks at its disposal to counterbalance the inevitable fact that eventually the novelty of basic daily deals will wear off. Deal personalization, for example, is ""still in the early stages"" in Europe. Similarly, the company's mobile offerings are not as advanced, and the ""deal bank"" for searchable, unused deals that Groupon has developed are also on the slow train to the old world.From the call, it sounded like the main reason Groupon hasn't been rolling out this newer technology is because it can't: different operations use different platforms, and integrating them has been a long process.""We have different technology around the world, and we have a goal to integrate these, but anyone with a history of a project like that knows it's not a one-quarter change,"" said Mason.Perhaps worryingly, the timeline for when this might happen is a little vague: ""It would be foolish to speculate on how long the completion of that process will take,"" he added. Meanwhile, Groupon continues to make gradual progress, with services like the deal bank getting introduced in Europe later this year.There are other investments being made, too. Groupon last week announced a new global head of sales, Kal Raman, putting into place a key part of the management puzzle post the departure of the Samwer brothers (in place because of their connection to Citydeal, the Groupon acquisition that now forms the backbone of its European business). Mason also said that the company is shifting R&D resources to better service Europe.But even while Groupon is addressing some of the tech, product and pricing gaps in Europe, it's facing another issue that Mason mentioned anecdotally: the average person on the street doesn't seem to know what Groupon is. ""When our business development people came over here to the U.S. they were surprised that the average person knew Groupon,"" he said. That kind of instant awareness hasn't hit Europe yet.All of this leaves Groupon, at the moment, in a position that is the opposite of Facebook's: Groupon still makes more revenues outside North America than it does within it (in Q2: $308 million for international; $260 million for N.A. on a total customer base of 38 million users) but U.S. growth at 66% is coming in more quickly than International and at this rate will overtake Europe in a couple of quarters.Our report on Groupon's earnings is here.Original post"
804851,31451,2012-08-14T04:07:36-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) continued to execute its impressive long run growth with Q2 2012 earnings reported on August 13th, posting earnings of 4 cents per share (8 cents per share adjusted) on revenue of $568 million. The earnings exceed analyst expectations, while the revenue fell 1% shy of the consensus among analysts. The revenue fell near the midpoint of guidance from the company, which is most impressive considering the company gave guidance back in May, well before the worst of the European economic impacts were known.Considering the company slid by nearly 50% since May as shown below, investors would be forgiven for expecting something less than a free-fall on the basis of the quarterly report.However, investors are overlooking the positives from the report, and have sent the shares down to an all-time low of $6 during after hours trading. The company guided appropriately on revenue and beat on earnings. In fact, the lack of earnings was previously tabbed as a primary reason for softness in Groupon's shares. Groupon has begun to address that by reduce marketing expenses and focusing on earnings, which was reflected in the solid quarterly earnings results.Groupon may well be a victim of its own success. Few companies, particularly those trading at just 2x sales, would be penalized for 45 percent revenue growth. Yet Groupon has been largely misunderstood from the beginning, as described in detail in a previous piece available here. Some analysts on CNBC spoke of limited barriers to competition as the primary concern with Groupon. However, those barriers to entry have not held the company back from growing revenue to over $2 billion and realizing revenue of $568 on $1.29 billion of billings during the quarter. Ultimately, Groupon has the strongest brand in the online deals industry, has a strong roster of customers, and close relationships with small local retailers that, if leveraged appropriately, could make Groupon a key player in local retail technology in due course. Perhaps most importantly, Groupon has gained traction with its Groupon Goods offers, which it directly sells through communication with its customers. Groupon Goods posted strong growth and CEO Andrew Mason stated during the conference call that it was responsible for the bulk of revenue growth in North America. Groupon Goods, while likely to reduce margins, will provide a more stable cash flow over time for the company and position it as a primary online retailer.Groupon has some challenges, to be sure. The company, which has nearly 12,000 employees, is rather labor intensive and needs to increase productivity. It is easy to forget that the company is just 4 years old, and is in a sense experiencing some growing pains as a public company rather than a development stage company behind closed doors with private advisers. There is a certain lack of freedom, and a certain pressure to meet numbers that can distract the management of young public companies by having to focus on discrete intervals of time that form quarterly filings.Despite all the concerns, Groupon continues to execute on its plan, and the strong growth of both United States and International business illustrates the quality of management at the company. It is highly difficult to continue to grow revenue at nearly a 50% clip when starting from a base of $1.6 billion as the company has done. Investors in Groupon should not trade on the basis of short term price action. Rather, they should digest the quarterly results and continue to hold shares and perhaps add to their holdings if their investing thesis in the company remains. It surely does for me, and over a 12-month to 36-month time horizon holders of Groupon will be richly rewarded if the company continues to execute as it has during 2012.Disclosure: I am long GRPN."
748201,28131,2012-07-25T14:12:02-04:00,,"The coverage on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is largely negative. Many questions have been raised - from the fundamental survival, to accounting problems to prognostications of bankruptcy. Despite the dire predictions, there is another kind of evidence. As an avid Groupon user, I find businesses advertising repeatedly in Groupon. Now, I find that those places are full of Groupon-driven traffic, and I do not see it declining much. Applying the Peter Lynch principle of ""investing in what you know,"" Groupon may still be the best daily deal.Rather than repeat the analysis of Groupon's amazing cash-generating capability, I looked at a different way to quantify the popularity of Groupon. A recent factor weighing on the stock was the ComScore report that Groupon's traffic numbers were lower in June than a year ago though, as the CNBC article points out, June numbers were higher than its Q1 quarter when Groupon reported its best revenue. How do we reconcile declining yr/yr site traffic with growing revenues?One word-mobile.The Groupon app is increasingly the way that users are interacting with Groupon. If the number of reviews of an app can be a proxy for its popularity, here is how Groupon stacks up in comparison to its nearest competitors:Data from Apple's App Store as of 7/17/2002.Note that these are the big bad guys that are supposed to be killing Groupon - LivingSocial, in which Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a stake, Google Offers by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) which is also being considered competition.These statistics are from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store. Statistics on Android may be somewhat different. This is not the place to analyze the Apple vs Google battle on the mobile platform. Nonetheless the Apple App Store numbers are indicative of the dominating position of Groupon and its high satisfaction rating.It is also worth reading the reviews of the Groupon app in the App Store.Click to enlarge.It gives an insight into why Groupon revenue is up and comScore's report of traffic dropping on Groupon's site can be explained simply by this review - ""Prefer the app version over the classic internet site"" - and is not indicative of a drop in Groupon's revenue. Note over a hundred enthusiastic reviews were posted on July 16 with the new app upgrade.In the last quarter (Q1 2012), Groupon reported revenues of $559.3 million, an increase of 89% from Q1 2011. It gave guidance of an increase of 40-50% of revenue in Q2 2012 over the previous year. Notably, mobile revenue was already 30% of overall revenue in April 2012 and continuing to increase as a percentage of revenue. In an area where companies like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are facing questions on their ability to monetize mobile Groupon is demonstrating how to do it.While the bears make valid points, including the issue of how Groupon accounts for its sales, all these issues are fixable as long as Groupon's top-line keeps growing and it keeps satisfying its growing customer base. Groupon's Customer Satisfaction ratings are among the highest according to Forsee. Even its much maligned merchant satisfaction ratings are higher than its peers and 91% of its merchant daily deal partners intend to do business via Groupon again.Currently Groupon trades for less than 10x this year's FCF, for a business that is still projected to show over 50% top-line growth and where cash flow grew at over 80% yr/yr. The next few quarterly earnings will give a clearer picture of Groupon's earning power and there is a high probability of an upside surprise from today's depressed valuations.Disclosure: I am long GRPN calls."

Groupon's business is perfectly legal.Investors should see reason for hope. Its legal problems are manageable, its lock-up period has expired, and it's moving steadily toward profitability. (The company next announces earnings on August 13.)For its March quarter, remember, Groupon reported its first profit in the ""income before tax"" line. It has been keeping its general expenses line steady, so growth on the top line (and that has been accelerating over the last year) should start heading to the bottom one. The company has no debt and enough cash on hand to get through six full months without revenue.My problem is with Groupon's basic business model. Remember that the idea is to have merchants offer a bargain price, to advertise that price to people who might be in a position to buy, and to activate the deal once enough people have signed-on to it.What's my problem with that?There will always be recessions, and there will always be companies that are suffering, that need something like Groupon in order to survive.

717731,20809,2012-07-12T12:31:39-04:00,,"Once again, it appears that short sellers are piling on in the lead up to Groupon's (GRPN) earnings report. It should be noted that this occurred leading up to the company's Q1 report as well and there was a tremendous short squeeze that started on the day of the company's quarterly release that continued driving the stock higher the following day. This two day squeeze allowed for a 50%+ gain in just two trading days as the stock traded as high as $14.93 per share.After the close yesterday, Nasdaq's short interest report was released showing that Groupon's short interest has surged to the highest level in the company's history - with over 27 million shares sold short. This report was based on the short interest as of the close of trading on June 29. Groupon's stock has traded down over 30% since that June 29th report was released (it traded down to $7.24 just a few minutes ago) leading me to believe that the short interest is potentially much higher now.While there have been many incidents (GRPN chairman Lefkofsky's ""stepping back"" blog post, negative analyst reports, etc.) that have likely contributed to the downward pressure on the stock, many outlets have pointed to the Comscore report showing that traffic to the Groupon sites was down 15% in June over the same period last year. Could it be that such a decline in traffic is largely the result of the company spending less on pay per click advertising, which was the company's largest expenditure in the months (including June of last year) leading up to the company's IPO? During that period, the company was still in the mode where it was spending like a sailor to add new subscribers, to a degree that many commentators suggested the effort to be excessive. As such, to report a month where traffic was down year over year vs. a period where the focus was growing the traffic and subscriber counts instead of operating profitably may not be indicative of anything other than that the company now has adjusted their aim to focus squarely on profitability and it is possible that the company is no longer spending wildly on pay per click advertising to keep those traffic counts up. While this is not knowable until the company reports for the quarter, traders may want to consider the possibility and also what will likely occur if this proves to be correct and the company again reports revenue and earnings that are substantially stronger than current street estimates.

782521,24631,2012-08-06T02:17:34-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reports Q2 earnings on August 13.The Street expects:In Q1, Groupon reported revenue of $559 million (+89% y/y) and consolidated segment operating income (CSOI) of $68 million, all of which were above street consensus. In particular, North American revenue was strong (+75% y/y) due to the introduction of technology innovations such as deal personalization, which delivers more relevant deals to the consumers and enhances the group-buying experience. The management guided a conservative $570 million in revenue and $70 million in CSOI for Q2.Heading into the earnings, we could see Groupon to continue making solid progress toward profitability. In my view, Groupon is the clear leader among group-buying sites because the company has first mover advantage, strong network effect, robust infrastructure, unrivaled scale, and superior technology, compared with the other group-buy clones. As it increases in scale, Groupon's marketing expense, a major component of group-buy sites' cost structure, has been steadily declining. I note that marketing expense declined 50% y/y in Q1, while revenue almost doubled. Strong execution will likely allow Groupon to maintain its positive operational trend, which places the company on a steady path towards profitability.Unlike many daily deal sites that simply broadcast merchants' deals to the consumers, Groupon has been investing on technology to address deal fatigue by incorporating deal personalization to deliver relevant deals based on the user's interest. The improved feature will lead to superior user experience and user growth.Finally, Groupon has been on a shopping spree, snapping up local startups such as Uptake (social travel search), Hyperpublic (location-based-services), Campfire Labs (social networking), and Breadcrumb (Point-of-Sale). The acquisitions seem to result in various degrees of synergy, given that Groupon could leverage the acquired talents and the customer base to further expand its daily offerings, which may allow the company to continue to enlarge the lead it has over rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Groupon first started raising eyebrows when it hit a $1.35B valuation within two years of being founded -- and raised even more eyebrows when it subsequently turned down a $5B buyout offer from Google in late 2010.Hyped by Forbes as the ""Fastest Growing Company Ever,"" Groupon's IPO in 2011 valued it at $12.7B. The stock popped 40% and briefly hit $30 a share. It was touted as the next great feel-good tech story.But unfortunately, from there, it all went downhill. The stock hit record low after record low, with the July 12 low of $7.25 representing a drop of over 60% from the IPO price, and a 75% drop from the all-time high of $31.14.So what happened to Groupon's growth?GRPN data by YChartsThe Business of CouponingCoupons are apparently worth a lot.

I haven't, but I've heard it's pretty crazy.What's also pretty crazy is that Groupon is yet another entrant in the string of ""publicly-adored tech companies that don't know how to make money."" I thought after the dot-com bubble that we'd see more rationality, and investors would actually start to care about whether or not a company was making money -- but as it turns out, the market is still addicted to the promise of a happy ending that the tech growth stocks can't ever seem to deliver.Even prior to the IPO, commentators were questioning Groupon's business model. Its inherent reliance on other companies' products gave the company little leverage to maximize profits, and its business model is not conducive to a moat. [Amazon (AMZN) offers a similar service called AmazonLocal, and Google (GOOG) has Google Offers.] The pessimism started to drown out the optimism as the months went on: in March, analyst Rocky Agrawal predicted Groupon was poised for collapse, and examined further problems with the business model:Shady Earnings, Shady AccountingWhile Groupon hasn't collapsed yet, many of Agrawal's points are still troubling: for example, Groupon has sold deals on medical procedures requiring certain medical qualifications, yet Groupon sells the deals to anyone. Further problems centered around Groupon's travel deals: the company often sold such deals without confirming purchasers were available on the specified dates. (Agrawal's analysis is fantastic, and if you're looking into Groupon from either a short or long perspective, I'd certainly suggest you click the link above the block quote to read it.)With such problems, it should come as no surprise that Groupon had a bit of a problem with refunds. If you buy a deal that you can't actually use for medical or scheduling reasons, you're probably going to be upset -- which is why Groupon was hit with a class-action lawsuit.It also turns out that Groupon didn't bother to account for refunds, instead booking income immediately -- so it had to restate Q4 2011 earnings to show a loss of $64.9 million. Refunds clearly had a pretty big effect on earnings, which is a bad sign for investors.But Groupon's semi-shady accounting problems didn't just start in Q1 - they're part of a long term trend. Forbes contributor Francine McKenna was being generous when she labeled Groupon ""Ernst & Young's Accounting Challenged Client.""Groupon ran into trouble with the SEC for using creative accounting on its S-1 last summer -- not only did Groupon use gross revenue instead of net revenue, but it also used a stat for total all-time customer orders in a quarterly results section.Even pretending for a second that Groupon didn't have to restate earnings, the company's earnings are reduced by stock-based compensation. While it forecasts income from operations at $15 to $35 million, Groupon also guided that stock-based compensation would be at the high end of that range -- essentially stripping public investors of any share of the profit, as all the profit is instead distributed to employees and executives via equity compensation. As explained by John Shinal at Marketwatch, this tactic is a throwback to the '90s dot-com era:All these accounting tricks add up to what I like to call a ""mess."" Groupon may be shuffling the board, but it doesn't surprise me that it can't seem to keep a COO around. One or two accounting mishaps would be one thing, but a consistent trend of borderline shady dealings? Doesn't look too good.The Future For GrouponSo far, I've established that Groupon A) has business model issues and B) has accounting issues. But at the current valuation, does it represent a good buy?I don't think so. ComScore traffic shows Groupon's visitor numbers are dropping, though company representatives say it isn't a big deal. Even putting aside Groupon's accounting issues, lack of a moat, and decreasing popularity with businesses and consumers (see Comscore data) alike, let's try to put a valuation on the company.Groupon's pre-revision Q1 earnings clocked in at 2 cents per share. (Note: this figure isn't actually accurate, as earnings were revised.) This figure was on $559M of revenue.Let's be extremely generous and give Groupon a yearly revenue of $3B. Scaling up EPS to this level resultings in a full-year EPS of 10.73 cents -- again, we'll be generous and round EPS up to, say, $0.12. Since Groupon is a ""growth"" stock, we'll give it a high TTM P/E of 50. Based on these fairly generous stats, at the end of the fiscal year, Groupon should be worth $6. This represents a substantial discount (>20%) to the current stock price -- and mind you, two factors to consider here. First, this is giving Groupon extra-generous earnings, and ignoring its 1Q restatement. Second, this is an end-of-year valuation. My conclusion is that Groupon still has room to fall -- and consequently, it looks like a bad long candidate, and a decent short candidate. (I'm not one for shorting myself, but if I was to short, I'd short Groupon. Now imagine me saying that in the Dos Equis Guy's voice.)ConclusionUnless Groupon's management can get the ship righted soon, the ugly downward trend may have a ways to run. Groupon faces stiff competition from bigger competitors Google and Amazon, who both have large built-in userbases that they can leverage.To me, it seems that Groupon is a symptom of a classic problem: putting the cart (the share price) before the horse (earnings). While Groupon is a novel and potentially useful service, I must admit that while I myself have signed up, I've never actually purchased a Groupon. Some of my friends have, though, and they were pleased enough with it. Yet here's the fundamental issue: having people like what you have to offer isn't good enough in the business world. You must be able to make money (and no, accounting shenanigans don't count). Since Groupon hasn't yet demonstrated an ability to do that -- and since the company is plagued by declining popularity and so many management questions -- it's hard to find much to like about the stock.Groupon isn't alone: many new tech stocks are overvalued. (See: All You Need To Know About Tech Investing In 5 Charts.) This problem also affects Facebook (FB), Amazon, and Zynga (ZNGA), to name a few. While such stocks may be suitable as a small speculative position for experienced investors, in my opinion, retail investors should stay well away.This is the conclusion I came to after thoroughly researching Groupon.

I realize the price of Groupon stock may bounce around. I am not looking at the stock price as I write this article - only the sustainability of the business.

623351,30151,2012-05-29T13:44:21-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is finally coming up on its IPO lockup expiration on Friday, June 1. After a restatement of prior earnings in April, the lockup, previously scheduled for May 4, was delayed 30 days and is now upon us.After the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO, Groupon was probably one of the most anticipated IPOs in 2011. While it did not shoot up 200% after going public like LinkedIn (LNKD), the stock did trade significantly higher than its list price at IPO of $20, peaking at $31. Anyone lucky enough to get allocated shares would have been able to flip them for a quick 50%-plus profit. Not bad for a day's work.The problem, of course, comes from the performance after the IPO. Since trading started on Nov 3, 2011, the stock has fallen significantly from $20 to $12.05 on Friday's close, a loss of 39.75%.While many question the viability of the company and the benefits that its products brings to consumers and retailers, GRPN, as a stock, was due for a bounce on the last earnings report.(Click to enlarge)Looking at the April - May RSI and price action there was a bullish divergence with the stock making lower lows with higher corresponding RSIs. While the GRPN report was nothing to write home about, yes Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) GAAP accounting losses still count, it was not abysmal and that was enough to get a significant short squeeze started.Popping from $10 to $15 and settling in around $12, the stock is now back near equilibrium and ready to make a move. With the lockup expiration coming up, many are expecting GRPN to sell off significantly. Let's see what the numbers have to say about it.Expiration ExpectationsWhatever you feel about the long term prospects, Groupon is still growing fast and is on the verge of profitability. While the company reported a GAAP loss of -0.02 for 1Q2012, it was a significant improvement from the -0.24 that it reported for 1Q2011.With revenue growing at 89% YoY and earnings showing significant improvement, the metrics we are seeing now at $12.05 are not screaming overvalued like they were above the IPO price.Price to sales stands at 4.10 and the estimated five-year PEG ratio is 2.16. While these are rich valuations, they are a far cry from what we saw at the IPO. We see higher price/sales valuations on the Facebook shares, even if FB comes under further pressure.Currently the float stands at 226M shares of 645M total outstanding shares. Of these 226M shares, 20.7M shares are being held short as of May 15 for a 10% short interest. This level of short interest is not high enough to justify much of a short squeeze and is likely indicative of the 1Q earnings short squeeze.With metrics that are not extreme in comparison to the other speculative growth plays out there, an improving earnings picture and a low short interest we have a few possibilities of what may happen once lockup expiration occurs. Some of the recent IPO lockup expirations might give us a hint of what to expect in the next few weeks.LinkedIn vs. Pandora (NYSE:P)Two of the other hot 2011 IPOs were LNKD and P and each had a different reaction once their IPO lockups expired.(Click to enlarge)LNKD is a great example of what most expect on a IPO lockup expiration, weakness in front of the date and further weakness afterwards. One week ahead of the date, the stock lost 10.6% and three weeks later had collapsed another 18.5% lower. When one thinks of the impact lockup expiration can have on a stock, LNKD is a classic example of why people attempt to short ahead of the event.(Click to enlarge)P had the same setup as LNKD with a 15% sell off the week before lockup expiration but a very different follow through. After initial weakness on the day of, the stock recovered all of its losses and by the end of the week closed 13% higher.The Trade That PaysEach of these scenarios had weakness the week before expiration so I can see a case being made for a short position in GRPN for the near term. I do not plan on trading the lockup expiration, but here is the trade that I would recommend.Start a small short position at open on Tuesday. If the stock is lower by 3 p/m. on Wednesday I would add to the short position and look to start taking any available profits near close on Thursday.The day of expiration I would observe and look to see if a stick save manifests. LNKD had a gradual stick save early in the day while P came late in the day and shot up like a rocket. I would use the nature of any stick saves to determine whether to cover the whole position or let it ride.After researching for the article, the Pandora scenario is that I see most likely for GRPN. I started out extremely negative on the stock but after the recent collapse and learning my lesson on P last year, the setup for a collapse does not appear to be in the cards.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
636001,21232,2012-06-04T14:52:13-04:00,,"Groupon probably won't make it another year. A great idea at inception, the company lacks a sustainable competitive advantage and has a slim (if any) hope for a profit margin. Here are 5 reasons why Groupon likely will not be a going concern within one year:1. The collective bargain model has limited barriers to entry. New entrants with large mailing lists can just as easily send out a mass-mail coupon as Groupon can. Evidence of this began years ago when OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) initiated OpenTable Spotlight, and had success stealing Groupon's restaurant market share using similar deal tactics.2. Groupon's major competitors, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), are companies with diverse business portfolios and this is just one of their many investments funded by deep pockets - Groupon is a pure play with no other financial backing to support potential cash shortfalls.3. Customers (business who use Groupons) have a high rate of attrition to competitors. Google offers a better cut of the end-user revenues and, perhaps more importantly, disburses the money back to the businesses more quickly - because they have the working capital to do so (see point #2). Just ask any business owner who has used this service.4. Low stock price = low morale = high employee turnover. Groupon's core competency is grass-roots consumer acquisition. That means their greatest assets are its people - and people won't want to stick around as the share price continues to fall (and hence, their compensation). Now, I realize this is a circular argument (because I'm assuming I'm right about the share price falling), but with the lock-up expiring and a lack of investor confidence (due to issues with internal controls and, frankly, some sketchy accounting), one would think the downward pressure might continue.5. Eric Lefkofsky has a past with aggressive accounting and ultimate business failures. He acquired Brandon Apparel, athletic-apparel maker, in 1994. At first, the company, like Groupon, saw fast growth, with revenue rising from $2 million to $20 million. Shortly after, however, the company went bankrupt: ""We over-leveraged the company and it eventually crumbled under the weight of that debt,"" Lefkofsky wrote. In 1999, Lefkofsky founded Starbelly, a relative first-mover B2B service provider. In early 2000, Starbelly sold itself to another company called Ha-Lo Industries for $240 million, much of which went to him. Not long after that transaction, Ha-Lo declared bankruptcy. Shareholders and others blamed the Starbelly deal, and a series of lawsuits ensued. His next company, InterWorkings, also has had some red flags, including a racketeering lawsuit. This track record demonstrates a pattern: rapid revenue growth accompanied by big losses, a penchant to sell stock early on, and lawsuits filed by investors, lenders or customers who feel they have been wronged.Groupon is probably kicking itself for turning down Google's $6 billion dollar bid a few years back. Now it's up to the shareholders to decide how fast the clock is ticking.Disclosure: I am long GOOG."
625831,22762,2012-05-30T10:48:59-04:00,,"By Rip EmpsonGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) just announced via its blog that it has acquired Breadcrumb, the creators of an affordable point of sale system and iPad app that targets local restaurants.While the terms of the deal have not yet been disclosed, Groupon has made a run of acquisitions over the last six months, and this move is likely one being made half for talent and half for access to the startup's client roster. That being said, we're hearing from sources close to the deal that the acquisition price was in the $10 to $15 million range, with a sizable retention pool for founder Seth Harris along with the sales and support team that will be staying on.The move comes as the daily deals behemoth looks to create more defined inroads with local mom and pop restaurants in accordance with its post-IPO mission to become ""the OS for local commerce"" - adding Breadcrumb and its technology to the fold is a step in that direction.The Breadcrumb buy is the latest in a slew of startup talent and tech acquisitions Groupon has made since going public last year - as far as we can tell, its eighth acquisition since November. In March, Groupon added FeeFighters to the fold, which followed the likes of Mertado, Adku, Campfire Labs, Hyperpublic, Kima Labs, and Uptake into Camp Groupon. And, again, all of those acquisitions have come since November.After all the grumbling surrounding Groupon's high valuation and blockbuster IPO, it seems that the company has been quietly ignoring detractors and is - at least by its own standards - on somewhat of a hot streak. Not two weeks ago Groupon beat estimates in its second quarterly earnings report since going public, seeing $559.3 million in revenue in Q1 2012, up 89 percent year-over-year, as well as increasing the total amount of money collected from customers for Groupons sold to $1.35 billion, up 103 percent, as Frederic reported.As a result, analysts have been far more positive on Groupon than they have in the past, thanks to acceleration in revenues at home (North America revenue grew 33 percent Q/Q) and a decline in marketing spend (down 25 percent Q/Q). While the company is spending money and really putting a lot of focus into growing abroad (see more on this here), the unsung hero of this positive outlook really seems to be Groupon's reinvestment in technology - a lot of which is owed to its recent talent and tech acquisitions.As CEO Andrew Mason said in his recent letter to shareholders, in total, Groupon has made 11 acquisitions in the last year, and the plan going forward is to integrate all of these acquisitions into a ""platform for local commerce.""Groupon's initial value centered around its being a marketing tool to connect consumers and merchants, but as Mason said at the time, the company's mission (as part of phase two) is to ""move upstream and serve as the entry point for local transactions.""The acquisition of Breadcrumb fits squarely into this mission, as the point of sale (POS) solution allows local merchants to cut the cord, take orders table-side and update their menus as they go using Breadcrumb's wireless technology built for iOS. The solution is designed to be flexible, allowing merchants to add or remove devices from their network easily, and easy enough that merchants can set up themselves and have it up and running in the same day.On top of that, Breadcrumb allows merchants to download their venue data and do with it as they please, keeping physical records or running their own reports, on top of speedy device registration.To sustain its upswing, Groupon needs to become an end-to-end commerce solution for local merchants, from marketing and scheduling, to integration with smart point of sale systems, to offer tracking, analytics, and better ways for merchants to retain customers (and find new ones) - both on the Web and on mobile. It's a tall order, but one that could create an actual valuable service for merchants - not to mention the fact that it comes with a lofty price tag, in that local commerce is a multi-trillion-dollar business.As for Breadcrumb users? Judging by the company's statement, the startup (and app) will continue to exist and operate both ""for new and existing clients,"" but obviously this means that Groupon now has access to the startup's client list, and Breadcrumb gets to reach a wider audience.What's more, we're hearing from sources that Breadcrumb founder Seth Harris will be staying on, running Breadcrumb at Groupon as part of a newly created company called Groupon Pospitality. Groupon will be putting the Kima Labs team (which they acquired in February) on the project to take over development, according to sources.Breadcrumb was designed in collaboration with mobile content development company, Two Bulls, and the startup's founder, Noah Harlan, who co-conceived the app along with Harris.The startup's website is currently down, but you can find it here.Find Groupon's announcement below:Original post"
631091,25106,2012-06-01T10:45:59-04:00,,"Shares of Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) are down sharply today to a new all-time low. This sharp move lower comes after GRPN had rallied sharply in early May following better than expected earnings.Facebook IPOThe Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO has been a disappointment to almost everyone in the investing community. The pressure on Facebook shares has spilled over to almost all other social media plays including Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Renren (NYSE:RENN) and LinkedIn (LNKD). Similarly, the Facebook disappointment has put pressure on GRPN as investors continue to re-value the company.End Of Lock-Up PeriodFriday is the end of the insider lock up period which means that 93% of the company's shares are now free for trading. However, it should be noted that a large percentage of these shares are held by venture backers and CEO Andrew Mason. Because of this, it is unlikely that a massive number of shares comes to market. That being said, the effect of the lock-up ending could weigh on GRPN for a while longer.Short InterestShort interest in GRPN currently stands at 20 million shares or 10% of the previous float. With the lock-up ending, the short interest as a percentage of the float will likely fall. This means that while the potential for a short squeeze still exist, it is less likely as the float will increase.CompetitionOne major headwind for GRPN's business is the increasing competition. While competitors such as Living Social and Google Offers (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been around for a while, Amazon Deals is a relatively new competitor. I find it difficult to say GRPN has any real competitive advantage.CashOne strong point for GRPN is the balance sheet. The company has $1.16 billion or $1.80 per share in cash and no debt. This money could be used in a variety of ways to benefit shareholders. One interesting use of the cash would be a share buyback.My TakeI find it difficult to get behind GRPN because I am not a huge believer in the business itself. While the stock may be oversold and due for a bounce, I do not think it is worth playing. I would rather buy almost any other social media play including ZNGA, FB, LNKD or RENN ahead of GRPN.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
655511,24802,2012-06-13T02:40:53-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is one of the most controversial stocks in the market, and one of the most emotionally charged. Its supporters, most of whom are overwhelmed here on Seeking Alpha, argue that the company is a leader in a huge new market, and will become a large and profitable e-commerce company. And its detractors, many of whom are here on Seeking Alpha, argue that the company is nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. Emotions are running high on both sides, something that we think is unwise. Emotion has no place in investing, and the hysteria surrounding Groupon has drowned out almost all reason and logic.In this article, we will attempt to address two issues central to the Groupon debate: its merchant satisfaction and the way Groupon accounts for its payments to merchants. We will also touch on Groupon's competitive positioning, as well as its overall restructuring of its accounting department.Since Groupon made its public debut back in 2011, the stock has steadily fallen, due to lock-up expiration, competitive fears, and a general climate of distrust surrounding Groupon.For purposes of disclosure, we initiated a position in Groupon this week, albeit indirectly, based on our belief that the stock has fallen too far. We own shares of GSV Capital (GSVC), an investment fund that owns shares of Groupon, and hold cash-secured puts (July 2012 puts at $9 strike) in Groupon. Before we delve into our examination of Groupon, a quick financial overview is in order.*Data is for Q4 2011, not Q1 2011Groupon is set to reach sustained profitability in 2012, based on consensus Reuters estimates, and as of this writing, trades at a P/E ratio of 49.75x 2012 EPS, and 14.21x 2013 EPS. We now turn to Groupon's merchant satisfaction and what the company is doing to increase it.Merchants: The True CustomerSubscribers who buy Groupons are essential to Groupon. And yet, they are not the company's true customer. Merchants are who Groupon is truly seeking. Without merchants, there would be no subscribers to buy Groupons. Therefore, Groupon must do all it can to attract, and above all, retain merchants to ensure the company's sustainability.Much has been made over whether or not Groupon provides value to merchants. Groupon would like to see itself as a company that enables each and every merchant to prosper with a Groupon deal. And Groupon's critics see it as a Ponzi scheme that throws merchants under the bus. As with many things, the truth lies in the middle. For some merchants, Groupon is in fact a flawed promotional tool. And for others, Groupon is a great way to enhance exposure and generate traffic.In general, merchants have one of two goals when they strike a Groupon deal: to either generate traffic or reduce inventory (such as off season inventory). There have been plenty of ""horror stories"" about how Groupons have proved disastrous for businesses. But there are also many success stories as well, and it is important to not let one side dominate the discussions. No product, including Groupons, can provide exactly what a customer wants every single time. As long as the majority of Groupon merchants are happy, then Groupon has done its job.So just what is Groupon doing to attract and retain merchants. The company's first quarter conference call yielded many insights into the company's strategy. Groupon served 100,000 unique merchants for the first time in its most recent quarter, a testament to the company's growing reach. So what is the company doing to retain those merchants? Several initiatives are being rolled out to address these issues.Groupon is moving aggressively to prove (to both merchants and critics) that it is an asset for merchants. In the coming quarters, these 2 initiatives will need to be watched closely for signs of increasing traction. Groupon's model is based in part on a cycle. More merchants mean a bigger subscriber pool. And more subscribers mean more merchants. Whatever Groupon has been doing to retain merchants, it seems to be working. According to studies commissioned by Groupon and conducted by ForSee (as well as independent ForSee studies), Groupon scored a 79 on ForSee's benchmark merchant satisfaction test, while the average score was a 64. Groupon also exceeds the Fortune 500 B2B (business to business) benchmark score by 10 points. In addition, 74% of merchants say that the main reason they work with Groupon is that the company helps them bring customers in the door.Merchants: A Dynamic Accounting ProcessThe way that Groupon accounts for its operations has been the subject of much debate and arguments. We will focus here specifically on merchant accounting, and touch on overall accounting later in the article.When a subscriber purchases a Groupon, Groupon splits that amount between itself and the merchant. Groupon's 10-Q filing for the first quarter of 2012 addresses the way it accounts for its payments to merchants. Groupon currently has 2 ways of paying the merchants it deals with: a redemption payment model and a fixed payment model. Below are direct excerpts from Groupon's latest 10-Q filing explaining the 2 models.Groupon's cash flows benefit from a redemption model because it sends cash out the door on an ""as needed"" basis. When a Groupon is redeemed, cash is sent, and it stays with Groupon until that time. Given that 57.34% of Groupon's revenue is derived outside of North America, the company's merchant payables increase quarter to quarter because international operations have so far been based on a redemption model. In the most recent quarter, the company's accrued merchant payables increased to over $576 million. There are several reasons for this. The first is due to international operations. Given that they are based on the redemption model, this figure serves as a sort of proxy for unredeemed Groupon liabilities, at least in the international business. The second is Groupon's scale, and the time lag of the fixed payment model. Under that model, used in the United States and likely the rest of North America, merchants are paid within 60 days of the Groupon purchase. Therefore, as Groupon pays merchants each quarter and accrues new liabilities, the accrued merchant payable account sees significant turnover, which many investors forget. It is not as if Groupon is simply not paying its merchants at all. Rather, that specific liability is growing because Groupon itself is growing. More Groupon deals mean more merchant payables to pay, and the company is accumulating them faster than it is paying down old ones. Given that Groupon is still in ""growth mode,"" this is to be expected. More merchants mean more revenue, and so long as Groupon can continue to achieve leverage in its business, that liability should not be seen as a major concern, in our opinion. The risk to this is that Groupon's cash flows are being propped up. However, this specific change in working capital would not drag Groupon to negative operating cash flow if it were absent. In the most recent quarter, Groupon had operating cash flow of $83.714 million. Changes in accrued merchant payables contributed $46 million of that, and that figure represents a sharp drop from the $121.173 million it contributed in the year-ago period. A shift to a fixed payment model would, on balance, depress Groupon's cash flows because cash would be sent out the door faster, but with operating leverage, sustained profitability would allow for more cash to be brought in the door.Groupon's accounting also ties into the satisfaction of its customers, meaning merchants. To increase their satisfaction, Groupon is speeding up the time it takes to pay merchants. According to CFO Jason Child, Groupon is accelerating payments to merchants in Europe, a trend that has been happening for a few quarters now. Groupon is moving some of its mature international operations (meaning Europe) to the fixed U.S. payment model. A year ago, Groupon took 75 days, on average, to pay its merchant customers. In the most recent quarter, that figure has fallen to 66 days.According to the usual ""people familiar with the matter"", there is another reason why Groupon slows its payments besides cash flow benefits: it has seen merchants use Groupons to provide a quick infusion of cash before going out of business, which would leave both subscribers and Groupon itself holding the bag. Merchants themselves are mixed on Groupon's payment terms, which lag those of competitors such as LivingSocial and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both promise full payment in 15 days, as opposed to Groupon's process of paying in installments of 1/3 of 60 days. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) promises 80% payment in 4 days and the remainder to be paid within 90 days. Some small businesses need cash flows to be prompt, while others say that there are no issues with stretching out payment, particularly if it means being able to do a deal with Groupon, which does have more scale than any of its competitors.Too many investors and followers of Grouopn ignore the nuances of the company's accounting, both on the bullish and bearish side. It is important to understand how Groupon's accounting for its deals with merchants works before making a judgment call on the stock.Overall Accounting & Control ProcessesEver since Groupon entered the public eye, its overall accounting practices have been the subject of much scrutiny. The latest accounting controversy at Groupon had to do with its restatement of 2011 results due to a need to increase refund reserve accrual. Groupon has pledged to tighten its accounting and internal controls, and so far we think the company is delivering on that pledge. Groupon has added 2 directors to its board with extensive accounting experience: American Express (NYSE:AXP) CFO Daniel Henry and Robert Bass, who retired as a vice chairman at Deloitte this month. The 2 will add accounting oversight to Groupon's board. Analysts brought up this issue of accounting and internal controls to CFO Jason Child on the company's latest earnings call. Child responded that Groupon is working to tighten its internal controls. He stated that the company has changed its refund methodology to get a much more granular look into the business. The company is now able to see weekly what is going on and plan for refunds accordingly. That process is being rolled out to the 48 countries in which Groupon does business, he said. Child expects for these fixes to be completed within one or two quarters. The statement of material weakness present in Groupon's annual report, however, will stay there until the company files its annual report for 2012.Competition: What is to be Done?In addition to accounting, competition has also been central to the bearish thesis on Groupon. And the truth is that there will always be at least one competitor for Groupon (LivingSocial). The daily deals market is such that it is easy to set up shop. But building a profitable business is what matters in the long run, and we believe that only Groupon, and possibly LivingSocial, have the necessary scale and reach to build a sustainable and profitable daily deals business.Groupon is the current leader in this sector, and it is working to maintain that lead. Initiatives such as Groupon Now! and Groupon Goods show that the company can innovate rapidly to stay ahead of its competition. Furthermore, Groupon's mobile presence is proving to be an increasingly profitable part of its business. In April, 30% of Groupon's transactions in North America were performed on mobile devices, as opposed to 25% just 4 months before that. Thanks to Groupon Now! and an emphasis on mobile features, subscribers who use the company's mobile applications generate about 50% more revenue than Groupon's web-only customers. As mobile becomes an increasingly bigger part of Groupon's business, revenue growth should be set to continue.It is important to understand that Groupon will never have the best deal for each and every subscriber. It is impossible for Groupon, or any daily deal company for that matter, to attract and retain every merchant. And on any given day in any given city, it is possible that Groupon will not be offering the ""best"" daily deal out of every single deal offered by every single daily deal company that operates in that city. But it is also possible for Amazon, Google, or LivingSocial to not offer the best deal as well. It is important for investors to not extrapolate their own experiences (or lack of experience) with a particular company's product from clouding their opinions about that company. The way that Groupon operates in your particular city on a given day, week, or month is unlikely to be indicative of how the company functions across all of its markets.Groupon is likely to emerge the victor in the daily deal battle because it has built a large business that despite popular opinion, has a decent economic moat. Groupon's merchant tools are at the forefront of the industry, and the company's subscriber base provides an added incentive to work with Groupon. It is a cycle that reinforces itself, and we expect that 2012 will prove that it is sustainable. Furthermore, Groupon is rapidly building its international business, and it now contributes a majority of Groupon's revenue. Groupon has worked hard to cement its status as the international leader, and we believe that too many people overlook the potential that Groupon has abroad. Groupon has a strategy of either entering localized international markets itself or buying the strongest daily deals company in those markets, using it to cement relationships with merchants, which is even more essential internationally than here in the United States.ConclusionsEmotion has no place in investing, and emotions have clouded the judgment of many Groupon investors on both sides of the debate. Groupon is not yet a company that is worth $20 per share. Will it someday be worth that amount? Possible. Is Groupon worth less than $10 per share? We do not think so, and that is why we now hold cash-secured puts against the stock. Now that the lockup has expired and so called ""weak longs"" have been flushed out, we think that it is likely that Groupon has found a bottom. Once emotion is removed, an investor can find that Groupon is a company that is on the way to sustained profitability, albeit not the kind of profitability that inflated expectations when the company first launched. A rational look at Groupon reveals that the stock has fallen too far, and that over time, long-term investors should see a good return on their investment as Groupon cements its leadership position here in the United States and internationally.Disclosure: I am long GRPN, GSVC, GOOG, AMZN.Additional disclosure: We are long GRPN via cash secured puts and via our holdings of GSV Capital. We are long GOOG and AMZN via a mutual fund that gives the company respective weightings of 2.1% and 0.94%."

We had suggested that:Since then, the market provided significant opportunities to profit from the fear around Groupon while the business has been firing on all cylinders. The stock remains significantly undervalued and there is little reason why it shouldn't go back to the $20 in the next few days after this earnings release.Fear creates opportunitySignificant concerns have been expressed about Groupon:As long as Groupon continues to delight its customers and keeps growing its active customer base, we see it doing well.Gobs of cashWe see free cash flow of at least $500 million in FY 2012, given this is the first quarter and revenue is increasing sequentially even after the Q4 2011 holiday season quarter and 89% yr/yr. Q4 2011 generated FCF of $155 million. What multiple would you assign to a company growing at 89% yr/yr? A back of the envelope calculation with a multiple of 40, less than half the growth rate, gives a valuation of $20 billion. Adding cash in hand of $1.2 billion and assuming a diluted share count of 700 million (current is 648 million) we get a valuation of about $30 a share. The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO will provide another catalyst to realize the valuation. At a price under $15, shares are over 50% off and it remains as good a deal now as any Groupon.Disclosure: I have long calls on GRPN."
569651,24631,2012-05-08T12:36:10-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reports 1Q12 results on May 14th. The Street expects:Heading into the earnings, investors can expect some uncertainty involving Groupon's financials and continued pain in the group-buy industry.Early last month, Groupon restated its 4Q11 results due to increased refund reserve accruals in which it adjusted revenue downward by $14.3 million, operating income by $30.0 million and net income by $22.6 million. The higher refund rate on the higher price offerings from the company's upscale service, Groupon Reserve, partially resulted in the increased refund reserve accrual.Higher refund accrual is a major risk that Groupon faces because it has serious impact on the company's margin. In a refund, Groupon return the associated purchase back to the customer, which lowers the revenue. However, investors need to note that the marketing cost associated with the purchase remains on the Groupon's income statement, thereby negatively impacting its margins.While it is encouraging to see Groupon moving toward the upscale segment, higher than average refund rate is a major concern and could continue amid slow growth in the group-buy industry. I note that LivingSocial reported a loss of $92 million during 1Q12, which gives investors some color on the weakness in the overall industry landscape.Going beyond earnings, investors can expect continued volatility of the stock and possible insider sales due to uncertainty involved in its financials and the upcoming June 1st expiration of lock-up agreements that will allow insiders to sell their shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The  Chicago-based company made $559.3 million in revenue during the first  quarter of 2012, up 89% year-over year. Groupon also announced that the  total amount of money it collected from customers for Groupons sold  (excluding taxes and estimated refunds) increased 103% from $668.2  million in the same quarter last year to $1.35 billion in Q1 2012.  Overall, though, Groupon still reported a net loss of $0.02 per share.  Non-GAAP earnings, however, showed earnings of $0.02 per share.The overall consensus  among analysts was that Groupon would report about $530 million in  revenue and the company itself had predicted revenue somewhere between  $510 and $550 million. For the next quarter, Groupon expects revenue to  be between $550 and $590 million.After its IPO, Groupon’s shares famously lost about 50% of their value.Update: The stock was up more than 17.76% in  after-hours trading. That’s on top of an 18.54% gain throughout the day  while the markets were open. That’s the biggest one-day increase in  Groupon’s stock price since it went public.More Highlights From Today’s ReportIn its report, Groupon also highlighted that its revenues in North  America grew 75% year-over-year “and accelerated sequentially faster  than they have since the first quarter of 2011.”For the first time, Groupon also served more than 100,000 merchants  per quarter in Q1. The company also reported that 50% of the offers it  ran in the first quarter were with merchants that had previously run on  Groupon. These merchants, Groupon also noted, continue to quickly adopt  the company’s Groupon Rewards  program. More than 30% of eligible merchants in the cities where the  company is piloting this program have signed up for it now.Another interesting number from the report: 30% of transactions in  North America were completed on mobile devices in the last quarter.

587651,25106,2012-05-14T14:41:44-04:00,,"Shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) are up nearly 20% today and many traders are asking why. Here are some of the reasons for the rally:Earnings After The CloseGRPN will report Q1 earnings after the close today. Simply put, someone knows something good is coming. It is highly unusual for a company's stock price to spike just before the company reports earnings. In many cases, a stock will make a large move after the company reports. However, in this case, it appears possible that a leak about the earnings report may have gotten out. While that is purely speculation, it would not be the first time such a ""leak"" has gotten out. Of course no one knows for sure what the numbers will be, but I believe the price action today indicates a good number is coming.Options ActivityGRPN options have been very active so far today. So far, over 20,000 May call options alone have traded. While a significant number of puts have also traded, about 15,000 in May, the call volume has been stronger. The options trades have likely forced options market makers to take a position in the stock to hedge their risk. The large options activity indicates that institutional money has been active in the name.Short InterestCurrently, GRPN has a short interest of 17.4 million shares or 8.4%. It is possible that the momentum from early in the day led short sellers to cover their positions ahead of earnings to lock in gains.Facebook IPOAs the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO approaches, some believe the event will serve as a catalyst for stocks such as GRPN. If the Facebook IPO is successful, it will likely alter they way other social media stocks such as GRPN are valued.ConclusionWhile it is difficult to say exactly why GRPN is up 20% ahead of earnings, the themes mentioned in this article are all likely playing a role. I believe investors should wait to see the actual earnings report before making a decision on GRPN. One thing I plan to listen for during the conference call is any mention of the competition. Are similar products such as Amazon Deals (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Google Offers (NASDAQ:GOOG) having an adverse impact on business for GRPN?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
566731,22762,2012-05-07T15:42:15-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenGroupon's CEO Andrew Mason today posted a letter to shareholders with some updated figures on how the company is doing, and a more specific outline of what Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) plans to do to to move beyond daily deals: ""To become the operating system for local commerce.""The move is a significant one as Groupon attempts to shore up investor confidence amidst a series of accounting issues, and the fact that some believe interest in the basic service of daily deals is beginning to wane.It also underscores some of the challenges Groupon still faces as a company. Mason notes that at the moment there are ""10 million geo-located subscribers engaging with Groupon every month who have yet to make a purchase.""""Though the six months since our IPO have been rocky to say the least, the fundamentals of our business have continued to improve,"" wrote Mason in the letter.Mason's letter today (on Groupon's blog and also filed with the SEC), is a long one, and here are some of the highlights.First he took investors through some of its milestone usage figures:Meanwhile, Mason's description of the next phase for Groupon is light on the specifics of what it will do, but essentially, the plan is for the the company to integrate those acquisitions and more in an attempt to create a platform for local commerce - which Mason says is a multi-trillion-dollar business.""Today, Groupon is a marketing tool that connects consumers and merchants. Tomorrow, we aim to move upstream and serve as the entry point for local transactions,"" he writes.Mason notes that there have been several key achievements already in its plan to develop a platform. Among them, he says the company is continuing to hone its personalization algorithm. (His example is the area of SmartDeals in Chicago, which he says have a 50 percent higher purchase rate than emails sent without them - and if that means less offers for vajazzles for me, well then that's awesome news.)Mason says that Groupon is now rolling out SmartDeals outside of the U.S., with a broad rollout planned by the end of 2012.Mobile is another area where Groupon is going large - not just in terms of acquisitions. That's because apparently, according to Mason, the average Groupon mobile user spends more than 50 percent more than those who are not using mobile.He notes that last month (April) nearly 30 percent of North American transactions were completed on mobile devices - although that doesn't seem like much of an improvement than four months ago when it was 25 percent.Mason doesn't go into detail on this here, but Groupon has, among other acquisitions, bought companies that bring it closer to the point of sale so we may well see the company offering more services here and trying to be more active in the mobile payments space.Mason also noted that its non-daily deal service - Groupon Now - has recently passed the 1.5 million items purchased mark. That's a fair distance still from Amazon and other companies that are more established in straight e-commerce, but it's a start.Groupon Rewards, the company's loyalty program, has now signed up about 30 percent of all eligible daily deal merchants.And the company's booking management service, Groupon Scheduler, is in the process of being upgraded, Mason says, with plans to offer ""a fully automated yield management system for every local business.""He notes: ""Scheduler embodies our intent to provide every mom and pop store with powerful technology solutions that were once reserved for sophisticated corporations with multimillion-dollar budgets.""""The company has seen revenues grow by 415 percent over 2010 to $1.6 billion in 2011, noted Mason, with its operating margin still showing the company at a loss - but significantly less so than before: it's now at -14 percent for the full year compared to -134 percent a year ago. In terms of earns per share that loss is down to $0.12 compared to $0.48 a year ago.Original post"

Now a public company, they have an obligation to provide investors with enough information to make an informed decision about investing in the company's stock. Sadly, the company did not provide sufficient metrics on their first quarterly report to gauge the underlying health of the business . We demand better stewardship from a company sporting a $13 billion market cap and a self-proclaimed market leader in the burgeoning Daily Deals industry.Providing a contrast between Groupon and a true a Best-of-Breed company, LinkedIn (LNKD), highlights Groupon's failings in financial transparency. Below is a summary of the key information that Groupon and LinkedIn provide on a quarterly basis:The amount of financial information a company provides can be a great indication of their confidence in the company's competitive advantage and growth prospects. They are proud of the business model they have built and are happy to share information. LinkedIn is a great example (Key Metrics & Financials 4Q 2011 and 4Q 2011 Earnings Presentation). Another great example is Rackspace (NYSE:RAX). Take a look at all the awesome Profitability, Return on Capital, Utilization, and Segment information they provide in their quarterly press release). Companies that are less confident in the future or have something to hide do not provide as much financial information. They prefer to keep investors in the dark and hope that people don't ask hard questions.Here is another visual that illustrates the lack of information from Groupon. The first slide shows what they were forced to report in their IPO filing by the SEC, the second slide shows you what they reported when left to their own desires:We are not sure why Groupon is being so coy with the metrics. It may be for competitive purposes, but management should at least tell us this is their reasoning on the conference call. Regardless, the lack of information they have provided makes it very hard to properly assess the health of the business, which is concerning since Groupon is a very immature business model that loses money, yet has a $13 billion market cap. We think it's important for investors to ask for the information and then let management tell us why they won't give it to us.Disclosure: We have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. We have a negative bias towards Groupon because we don't believe in the  longevity of the business model, are worried about the quality of  management and their technology infrastructure, and think the stock is  wildly over-valued."

We later took profits, by closing 50% of our position, at $13.12 and we are now left with half the size of our original position. This is how the downhill appears:I believed it was a fantastic opportunity because of an aberration in valuation converged with a catalyst. The catalyst at the time was the company having to issue revised reports due to a high refund reserve.ValuationsGroupon, although still pricey in absolute terms, is no longer expensive compared to other social companies or even compared to where it was only 2 months ago. In fact, judging by its PEG or by its Price/Sales, some investors might even claim that it is an absolute bargain. Some would say that the company was over-punished for its sins. I appears much more reasonably valued at current valuations.Accounting GimmicksOn March 30th, GRPN reported that it was revising its previously reported revenue of $506ML by $14.3ML.What this basically means is that the company has suffered a high rate of refunds.

526021,24802,2012-04-25T09:13:29-04:00,,"Newly public companies rarely have their stories written in the first few months, or even the first year of trading. As one of the most prominent IPO's of 2011 Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has received a great deal of coverage, both positive and negative. On balance, however, the coverage has tilted towards the negative side, and there has been a substantial impact on Groupon's stock price.With such a fall in the stock since its IPO, is Groupon now a buy? That is the question we wish to explore. As a matter of disclosure, we hold no position in Groupon stock or options. We would like to remind readers that this article is not intended to recommend Groupon one way or another. We will be presenting a look at both the bullish and bearish theses on Groupon, and readers should draw their own conclusions from those.Before we delve into the arguments surrounding Groupon, we first provide a brief overview of the company's financials (the data includes the effects of Groupon's fourth-quarter restatement, which we discuss below).Groupon FinancialsBearish on Groupon: Accounting IssuesWe will start first with the revised fourth quarter earnings. On March 30, Groupon announced that it is restating its fourth quarter earnings. Specifically, the company lowered EPS by 4 cents per share and lowered revenue by $14.3 million (both figures are accounted for in the financial figures above). The restatement was due to a shift in quarterly deal mix to higher priced deals, which have higher refund rates. As such, both Groupon's revenue and cost of revenue were affected by this due to the need to increase refund reserve accrual.Groupon noted that its cash flows were unaffected by the restatement and affirmed Q1 guidance of $510-$550 million in revenue and operating income of $15-$35 million. Furthermore, the company noted that its auditor, Ernst & Young included a statement of material weakness related to its internal controls in its annual filing with the SEC. Groupon also noted that it is working to address these issues and is expanding its accounting staff and engagement with auditors.This opens up a debate on other accounting elements of Groupon's business model. By its very nature, accounting is an imprecise science, at best. And although GAAP does provide a measure of standardization across different companies, it often does not truly portray how a company is doing. There is no one set of accounting practices that can paint an exact picture of how a company is doing, no matter how ordinary its business may seem. That being said, Groupon has had a history of unusual (albeit legal) accounting practices.When the company first filed for its IPO back in 2011, it included a new way of measuring income: adjusted consolidated segment operating income. In that measure, known as adjusted CSOI, Groupon excluded several costs, such as marketing and acquisition-related expenses, arguing that those expenses will not be elevated indefinitely. Thus, the company believed that adjusted CSOI presented a better picture of its performance. Under pressure from both investors and the SEC, the company no longer gives prime weighting to that measure.When it first filed for its IPO, Groupon used gross accounting to arrive at its revenue figures. For example, if Groupon sold a Groupon for $50, it would split that $50 with the merchant, keeping $25 for itself. But the company would book that $50 as revenue, and charge $25 as cost of revenue, or cost of goods sold. Thus, the company had a gross profit of $25, before operating expenses were added in. We believe that the net effect of this is a wash, at least in regards to income. This is due to the fact that under the net method, the cost of the Groupon (cost of goods sold) has already been accounted for.Thus, there would be no real cost of goods sold, and the company's expenses would be the only figures to deduct from revenue. The FASB states that the issue of gross vs. net accounting relates to the fact that some investors value companies on multiples of revenue, not income. It notes that there is no real difference between the two methods in regards to income. We illustrate this below, using the hypothetical example of the $50 Groupon above.Gross vs. Net AccountingThis accounting measure was controversial because it allowed the company to essentially alter its revenue by changing the kinds of deals it sold, even if net income would be the same at the end. Thus, growth could possibly be manipulated under the gross method. Groupon has also dropped this metric, and now records revenue on a net basis, while still reporting gross billings.The third, and perhaps most concerning accounting issue we have identified with Groupon is one that relates to refunds (similar to the refund reserve issue that led to the company's refund restatement). Groupon openly states that customers may ask for refunds at almost any time. If a business that a customer bought a Groupon for goes out of business, Groupon issues a refund. And if a merchant refuses to honor a Groupon, the company also usually issues a refund.While this may not be an issue related to the largest Groupon campaigns, it is a risk when it comes to deals relating to smaller businesses. In this case, Groupon is essentially acting like a retailer that does not account for gift cards. A retailer that sells a gift card to a customer treats it as deferred revenue, and recognizes it only when an actual sale has occurred. Groupon, however, does not currently report Groupon's outstanding as a liability, due to the fact that it is largely impossible to calculate that figure. It is possible that Groupon's restructuring of its accounting will lead to more clarity on this front.Bearish on Groupon: Competition & User RetentionAnother central aspect of the bearish thesis surrounding Groupon is competition. There are many daily deals sites, and although Groupon is the largest, it is certainly not the only one to have caught the attention of consumers. LivingSocial is Groupon's fiercest competitor, and the two companies are actively trying to be the undisputed leader in this space.In addition, both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are trying to gain a foothold in the space, and it can be argued that they have far more financial firepower to invest in that business than either Groupon or LivingSocial. In addition, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is rumored to be entering the daily deals space in 2012. Should they choose to ramp up their activity in the sector, Groupon could possibly lose its leadership position in the daily deals space.Groupon also faces issues with customer and merchant retention. Bears argue that there is little incentive for customers and merchants to stay with Groupon once a particular deal has executed. There is little in the way of hard evidence when it comes to retention. Most stories are anecdotal in nature that happen to go viral. Some merchants love Groupon.Others say it was a terrible experience, and say Groupon does nothing to promote repeat and loyal customers. Business Insider did a small survey of Groupon merchants and found mixed results. 60% of businesses considered their Groupon campaign a success, but more than half said that they will not do another one. In addition, the majority of businesses said that Groupon was equal to other daily deal sites, arguable a bearish factor for the company's stock.The issues presented above are several of the main bearish arguments concerning Groupon. But the truth is that there is never one side to any stock. There is always a bearish argument, and there is always a bullish argument. Simply criticizing Groupon without exploring the positives of the company is not constructive. Nor is ignoring the negatives. Having laid out the bearish thesis, we now turn to the bullish arguments concerning Groupon.Bullish on Groupon: A Value Stock in Social and High-Growth TechnologyMerely providing a P/E ratio, or other valuation ratio and saying that a company is undervalued or overvalued is largely irrelevant. A company with a P/E ratio of 5 is not necessarily cheap. Nor is a company with a P/E ratio of 50 necessarily expensive. To gauge value, a company must be compared to either the markets, or its peers. And on that basis, Groupon offers value in the social and high-growth technology sector.On a price-to-sales basis, Groupon is now cheaper than many companies in the S&P 500. According to our figures, Groupon trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.136. To calculate that figure, we adjusted Groupon's trailing 12 month sales by taking away Groupon's revenue for the first quarter of 2011 and adding it the midpoint of its projected first quarter 2012 revenue guidance of $510-$550 million (thus we arrived at adjusted trailing sales of $1.844907 billion). We compare Groupon's price-to-sales ratio to that of several of its social media and high-growth technology peers below. Data is taken from Yahoo! Finance unless otherwise cited.Price/Sales Ratios for Social and High-Growth Technology StocksOn a price-to-sales basis, Groupon's valuation is not stretched, at least in relation to its social and high-growth peers (comparable data for its most direct competitor, LivingSocial, is not available as it is a private company).As Evercore noted on Monday, Groupon now trades at just 10x its 2013 EBITDA estimates, half of the multiple Google offered when it attempted to buy Groupon in December 2010 (Evercore upgraded Groupon to Overweight, and despite a cut it its price target from $20 to $15, still sees 25% upside in the stock).Groupon also present value relative to the rest of the sector on several other valuation metrics. The Reuters consensus estimate for 2012 earnings is a profit of 22 cents per share, implying a P/E ratio of 54.45x 2012 earnings. While that may be a large premium to the rest of the market, it is a discount to many stocks in the rest of the social media space.Pandora has no P/E ratio, LinkedIn has a forward P/E ratio of almost 164. Zillow has a forward P/E ratio of almost 122. And HomeAway has a forward P/E ratio of around 50. Zynga has a forward P/E ratio of around 33. And Google, Amazon, eBay, and Travelzoo have forward P/E ratios of 13.77, 149.21, 16.88, and 15.89, respectively. While 54 times forward earnings may not be ""cheap"" by classical definitions, it is important to look at Groupon's valuation in the context of the rest of the social media space, where large P/E ratios are the norm.On a price-to-free cash flow basis, Groupon presents even more value, according to data compiled by Credit Suisse.Groupon trades at a discount to many of its peers on this metric, and currently has a P/FCF ratio of 29.21, based on 2012 estimates. When 2013 free cash flow estimates are used, Groupon is cheaper than even Google, which is trading at 9x 2013 estimated free cash flow as of this writing compared to Google's 15x estimated free cash flow. It is much more difficult to argue that Groupon is overvalued at its current stock price when it trades at a discount to its sector and its peers on multiple metrics.Bullish on Groupon: Competition Can be Kept at Bay & Customers Can be RetainedOne of the central tenets of the bearish thesis on Groupon is the fact that competition in the daily deals space is fierce, and that customers have no reason to use Groupon versus its competitors. Yet to truly understand the dynamics of the industry, several factors need to be examined.Already, Yelp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have both withdrawn from the daily deals space due to an inability to gain traction. Furthermore, the fact that Groupon is already the largest daily deals company may in fact give it economies of scale that strengthen its competitive position, according to Credit Suisse.Merchants know that since Groupon has the largest subscriber base on any daily deals company, they can reach more customers that way. Therefore, they go to Groupon. Customers know that since Groupon has the most merchant partners of any daily deal company, they can get better deals from it than other companies. Therefore, there is an incentive for them to choose Groupon.More customers leads to stronger relationships with merchants, which leads to more customers. Simply building a daily deals website and signing up some merchants is not enough to challenge Groupon. The lead that the company has in merchant partners and subscribers may not be possible for other companies to overcome.Furthermore, competition is rarely the reason that Groupon users stop using the service. Credit Suisse's survey of Groupon customers shows that of the customer's that stopped using the service, only 8% said that they stopped using Groupon because its competitors were superior. The vast majority said that they could not find relevant deals, a risk that all daily deal companies face. It is impossible for Groupon, or any company for that matter, to please every customer and potential customer.From the data above, it does not seem like competition is the main issue. Rather, it is relevance. And Groupon has been working to address that issue with new initiatives like Groupon Now! and Groupon Rewards, which is designed to increase customer loyalty, a key concern merchants have with Groupon. It appears that the company is going to great lengths to enhance its relationship with both customers and merchants.ConclusionsGroupon is certainly a controversial company, and this article was designed to provide an overview of both the bearish and bullish arguments surrounding the company. It is inevitable that different readers will draw different conclusions from this article. Some people will see Groupon as too cheap to pass up, given its growth potential and valuation. And some will see it as an unsustainable company with too many competitors and accounting issues. For those who place value in such metrics, the Reuters average price target of 25 analysts covering Groupon is $22.53, implying upside of 88.38% from current levels.As for our opinion, it is a bit more complex. We do believe that the Groupon business model is sustainable, but are not yet comfortable buying the shares. Why? Because we would like to see LivingSocial become a public company before we consider initiating a position in Groupon. Part of what makes Groupon so controversial is that it is the only major daily deals company to be public (there is much debate regarding whether or not Travelzoo is a Groupon peer).As such, there is no real way to evaluate precisely how well Groupon is performing relative to its true competitors, namely LivingSocial. Once that company goes public, it will become much easier to see just how well, or how poorly Groupon is performing. For now, however, Groupon will continue to attract the interest of the investment community, and we see no signs that the debate surrounding the company will go away. Our goal with this article was to present the bearish and bullish arguments for Groupon in a balanced way, and we hope that readers will be able to make an informed investment decision regarding Groupon based on that.Disclosure: I am long P, FB, GOOG.Additional disclosure: We are long shares of FB via our holdings of GSV Capital (GSVC) and the Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC).

568131,20809,2012-05-08T03:02:42-04:00,,"Last month I wrote an article suggesting that investors should consider buying Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) shares because there will be some point at which traders will recognize that the sentiment has gotten so ridiculously negative and there are so many short sellers crowding the trade that any small shift in sentiment will allow for a double digit return almost overnight. Since that time, the negativity has only increased as there have been at least five new 52 week lows (including yesterday at $9.82) to add to the five or six new lows we had in the days leading up to the previous article. The only substantive news since that time has been the hiring of two new accounting oriented board members and two high profile management additions to help the company manage its remarkable growth.What seems to have an even bigger impact on Groupon's stock than any substantive news is the constant drumbeat of negative commentary, most of which continues to harp on the same issues that caused the stock to start selling off back when it was trading north of $20 per share, along with a good dose of the ""Groupon is evil"" and ""Groupon is going bankrupt"" garbage. The volume and increasing fervor with which this negativity is being perpetuated leads me to believe that there are some who may have actually crossed a line between 1) a healthy distrust for the reported numbers of a company that has achieved such unprecedented growth and 2) a contempt, antipathy and what seems to border on some kind of irrational fear of Groupon. For the sake of brevity, I will call the latter ""Groupophobes"".It appears that these Groupophobes will continue to inundate us with negativity in hopes of beating Groupon's stock down even further. I believe that if you take a closer look at two of the most oft repeated Groupon ""evils"", those usually peppered with such phrases as fraudulent, misleading, bankrupt, etc., you may find that Groupon is not as evil as the Groupophobes would have us believe.1 - The SEC mandated accounting change before the IPO - Usually given as an example of Groupon management's ""fraudulent"" or ""misleading"" accounting, this most often includes a discussion of the SEC required adjustment in how Groupon reported its revenue leading up to the IPO. Before the required adjustment, Groupon was reporting gross billings (the amount it collects from consumers when they purchase goods and services) as revenue. There is nothing evil about that, it's the same thing that Priceline (PCLN) does with its opaque hotels offering where it acts as the merchant of record and nobody has ever suggested that Priceline is evil for doing it. While I will not use this space to argue against the SEC's determination that the company should report revenue as gross billings net of the amount paid to the merchants, I think it's ridiculous to suggest that Groupon management was trying to mislead or ""be evil"" like the Groupophobes would have us believe, given that the most relevant determinant in which approach is proper is the question of who is the ""primary obligor"" in the transaction. This can be measured by determining the party the customer will look to for ensuring its satisfaction, which is best measured by who bears the majority of the risk in the transaction. Arguably, the ""Groupon Promise"" puts Groupon (in certain scenarios) at risk up to the full amount of the transaction (see point #2 below for the impact that can have) and it is often the party consumers will hold responsible for ensuring their satisfaction. Thus, while we can argue about the SEC's determination that Groupon should report net vs. gross, it is ridiculous to suggest that Groupon management was trying to mislead investors when they reported using the Priceline approach, particularly when the Groupon promise makes them much more of the primary obligor than Priceline is in its transactions.2 - Restatement of Q4 Results - Your average Groupophobe would like you to believe that Groupon management intentionally tried to mislead investors as to their earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 and that they got caught by the auditors so they had to restate their reported results. I have to disagree. This is just a really good example of the kinds of surprises that occur when a company that is growing as rapidly as Groupon tries something new - which in this case was the introduction of higher priced luxury goods in the lead up to the Christmas shopping season. While we can all agree in hindsight that the company should have adjusted their allowances for the possibility of a different level of returns, do we really believe that Groupon management was trying to sneak this one past us? Or are we all guilty of thinking that anyone who can grow a company from 120 employees and $14m in revenue to 10,400 employees and $1.6B in revenue in three years must have a crystal ball that allows them to see the future better than the rest of us and this should have allowed them to see that a larger percentage of customers would return higher priced daily deals than what the ""historical"" averages would suggest. Keep in mind also that the ""historical"" requires us to hark back to the early daily deals era - (maybe even as far back as 2009) to crunch numbers from smaller deal transactions and somehow extrapolate that to determine what would happen with higher priced goods/services. In hindsight, it's obvious that the company's historical allowances for returns were insufficient because they were based on the lower priced goods and services we might usually associate with ""traditional"" daily deal offerings. However, the ""obvious in hindsight insufficiency"" should not be construed as an attempt to mislead and the company has obviously taken steps since that time to put greater controls in place to catch such errors in the future.These are just two great examples of how the phenomenon of Groupophobia can distort things in such a way that investors might not see clearly the potential that still lies within the Groupon franchise. While it's still early to assume that Groupon will continue its meteoric growth and become the force in local commerce that leads many of us to consider investing in Groupon in the first place, those looking to profit from Groupon stock should give serious consideration to the near term potential for a rebound in the shares. I believe the next week or so will cause investors and even traders to be a little more open minded about the Groupon trade and we might even get a reprieve from the ""Groupon is evil"" dogma that we have been inundated with the last few months. A quick survey of traders whose opinion I value indicates that some who were short are now covering and others who would have just recently argued for aggressively selling Groupon short now reveals a slightly more open-minded ""No, I am not long Groupon...not that there is anything wrong with that"". This is progress and as we start to look ahead to the next week or so, I think you will see more and more Groupon longs come out of the closet. No more hiding away from the dogmatic rhetoric and denying what we know to be a great growth story, (albeit one with the inevitable bumps in the road). Maybe even some of those Groupophobes will confirm what we already suspect - that many of them now want to be long Groupon too, they are just afraid that they will be chastised by their peers for taking such a stand. While they may not have the guts to take a true long position, I believe that many will at least ""box"" those short positions over the next couple of weeks. Other Groupon longs who might come out include all the fence sitters who quietly have appreciated the Groupon growth story, but were afraid to try and catch the falling knife and traders who perceived Groupon to be a poor investment at $20+ but now get to invest at a valuation similar to what Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was willing to pay when the company was about one third its current size. Additionally, I think investors/traders on both sides of the table (longs and shorts) will have to give serious consideration to several factors that may impact the stock over the next seven or eight trading sessions:1) On Wednesday the Nasdaq short interest will be released and I expect that we will continue to see an enormous short interest in Groupon shares, one that would take weeks of ""buy to cover"" transactions at the normal trading volume levels to cover entirely. Given the timing of #2 and #3 below, I would be surprised if we do not see major short covering or at least the boxing of short positions until these potentially explosive events are in the past.2) Groupon reports earnings next Monday - Do we really think that Groupon is going to miss the revenue or earnings projection for Q1, the projections that they made on the last day of the quarter when they disclosed the accounting issue that has knocked nearly 50% of their market cap? I am betting that they will exceed those numbers and maybe even increase their projections for the remainder of the year. Also, I will be very surprised if we do not see other significant positive news in the release or on the earnings call Monday. Even the most hardened Groupophobes will likely consider covering or boxing at least some part of their position going into Monday's earnings call.3) The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO is currently expected to price next Thursday the 17th. No conspiracy theory here, but doesn't it seem likely that many of the big banks that brought Groupon to market who are also participating in the Facebook offering would have an incentive to see Groupon shares rally from their current record lows? Trying to place what is arguably the biggest tech IPO in US history would be less challenging if the most recent significant tech offering from just six months ago is showing signs of life vs. hitting new 52 week lows each day. Not saying that Goldman, Morgan Stanley, et al.'s trading desks or retail brokers will be pushing Groupon over the next week or so, just saying that I would be surprised if we don't see some money flowing into Groupon over the next week and a half leading up to the Facebook IPO.In summary, it seems that investors/traders who are looking to trade Groupon on either side might want to start considering some of the Groupophobes' negative commentary in its proper context. Many of them are likely short Groupon stock and there are so many shares sold short now that it will be difficult for them all to cover their positions before the events mentioned above without causing a significant increase in the stock price. Given the number of traders watching the Groupon story and the propensity for them to ""pile on"" when the momentum shifts in either direction, the likelihood of positive news coming on Monday and the powerful hype machine for tech and social media names that will be running at levels heretofore unseen for the Facebook IPO, it seems that the money to be made with the Groupon trade is on the long side for the near term, regardless of what you believe about Groupon's future. So if you run across some of those Groupophobes over the next few days and they seem a little testy, don't hate, just hug them. Isn't it time we gave the Groupophobes a little squeeze?Disclosure: I am long GRPN."
521981,22762,2012-04-24T12:23:55-04:00,,"By Kim-Mai CutlerRemember when Groupon raised, like, a billion dollars? We certainly do. Well, it looks like Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) slide over the past month is bringing its last round of venture investors ever closer to breaking even. The stock has rebounded slightly this morning to $11.49, but the number to watch is $7.90.That's effectively what several top-tier Silicon Valley venture firms including Kleiner Perkins, Greylock and Andreessen Horowitz paid per share when they invested $946 million in Groupon between Dec. 2010 and Jan. 2011. At that point, they bought Series G Preferred Shares for $31.59 each. These later converted into four shares of Class A common stock on Oct. 31 of last year, just a few days before Groupon's initial public offering on Nov. 4.All eyes are on May 14, when Groupon will report quarterly earnings for the second time as a publicly traded company. More notably, the end of the lock-up period is coming up soon. That's the point at which investors will actually be able to sell their stakes in the company. It's coming up on June 1, after being pushed back from the original date of May 2 because that was too close to their earnings date.Right now, their stakes in Groupon are up about 45 percent from the price they paid a year and a half ago. It's the kind of return that would normally sound awesome, but it's probably not the kind of return late-stage venture investors were hoping for when Groupon looked like an easy win in late 2010 after turning down a $6 billion offer from Google. When Groupon debuted, it shot to $28 on its first day, which would have given investors at least a 3X on their investment. Now it's down to the kind of margin that a bad earnings report could devour in a heartbeat.For those who like to keep score, here's the table of who participated in that round and how much they invested:It's worth noting that these shares had preferences or protections, and were senior to several other rounds of preferred shares (meaning these investors had the right to take their money out first before others). But those preferences apply during a ""liquidating event"" or if the company is dissolved, wound up or liquidated.Now to be clear, when the lock-up period expires, these investors will merely have the option to sell their shares. They may decide to hold onto them for longer as a bet that this is a short-term stumble and that Groupon will rebound. It would also be silly to lock-in losses at the bottom. The company's shares took a precipitous slide when Groupon said on March 30 that it had to restate its fourth quarter earnings because of weak accounting controls. The restatement deepened the company's net loss to $65.4 million from $42.7 million.For the next report, Groupon has given guidance to expect $510-550 million in first quarter revenue with income from operations coming in at between $15 million to $35 million. That would be up from $295.5 million in revenue and a $117.1 million operating loss from the same time period a year earlier.There are analysts out there arguing a bull case for Groupon. Goldman Sachs' research team had a buy recommendation with a 12-month price target of $25 as of April 1. Morgan Stanley analysts say that the company's relationships with local merchants through its 5,000-person salesforce help make the company's model defensible. The earnings restatement was ""a mild hiccup in Groupon's compelling long-term story,"" Morgan Stanley's Scott Devitt wrote in a research note.So it's quite possible that this very post marks the point at which all negative news has been priced in. Here's hoping for Groupon's sake.P.S.: Do you know which late-stage investors would actually be in the red if they could sell today? The ones that bought Zynga's Series C Preferred shares in February 2011 at $14.03 a pop. They converted one-for-one into Class B common stock with the company's IPO. Zynga shares currently trade at $8.72. (Ouch!)These investors include 11 mutual funds associated with Morgan Stanley plus a token investment from Kleiner Perkins, through the firms' digital growth fund and another digital growth founders fund. Don't cry for Kleiner though. Bing Gordon, who sits on Zynga's board, got the firm into the company years ago. Most of Zynga's investors are subject to a lock-up that ends around May 28, although some employees will be able to start selling their holdings a week from now around April 30, according to the company's prospectus.So what do Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Groupon teach us? For highly hyped consumer tech IPOs, public markets have turned out to be far harsher judges of value than previously thought.Original Post"
515401,22829,2012-04-20T23:34:00-04:00,,"By Brian SatterfieldBefore its IPO last November, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) acquired 16 companies, 10 of  which were competitors that expanded the daily deal heavyweight’s reach  into regions such as South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  Having grown its coupon empire to cover most corners of the globe and  established itself as the sector’s market leader, Groupon has since  taken a broader approach to M&A, buying into areas that complement  its core coupon business.Since the capital infusion that accompanied its Nasdaq debut last  November, Groupon has been on an acquisition spree. More than one-third  of its total 25 deals have come in just the past five months. In fact,  according to its recently filed annual report, the company completed six  transactions in just the first two months of 2012. But with the  exception of the purchase of Mertado in January, Groupon has strayed  away from scooping up other daily websites, instead targeting businesses  that allow the company to bolster its online community and commerce  capabilities. More specifically, Groupon’s recent M&A moves have  been primarily to obtain the startups’ expertise in information database  development, search engine development, location-based technologies,  merchant products and support, and transactional marketing.Earlier this week, Groupon picked up San Francisco-based Ditto, the  maker of an iPhone application that enables users to plan activities  with friends based on their location. A Ditto blog post hinted that the  deal was primarily geared toward Groupon’s need to add community  features, the same rationale that likely drove the company’s purchase in  February of online travel enthusiast community Uptake Networks.  Groupon’s other post-IPO mobile play also came in February, when it  reached for VC-backed Kima Labs, which developed an iPhone application  that allowed consumers to make online purchases with their phones. That  same month, the company made yet another e-commerce move when it took  out online shopping recommendation software provider Adku.It’s also worth noting that while Groupon has expanded its M&A  strategy in terms of technology, its geographic focus has clearly  shrunk. Eight of the nine companies it has acquired post-IPO have been  based in the US."

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) executives realized this back in 2010 when they bid 6 billion dollars for Groupon while the companies annual revenue was a mere 310 million. Since then Groupon's revenue has soared 500% to 1.6 billion and continues to boom. Groupon fell from favor amidst an accounting snafu that caused Groupon to restate earnings in order to correct a 30 million accounting error. As a result, Groupon is now trading at about half its IPO price - making it the ""deal of the day.""Just a few days ago at Evercore Partners, Analyst Ken Sena, upgraded shares of Groupon to ""Overweight"" and has a conservative $15 target price. Nasdaq research list 6 Strong Buy, 10 Hold, and 3 Sell ratings making Groupon a ""Buy.""Bloomberg is reporting that Groupon is replacing 2 board members with seasoned financial experts Daniel Henery, and Robert Bass to reassure investors that the accounting problems will not reoccur.The sell-off is clearly overdone and obviously exacerbated by fear mongering short sellers that traffic in terrorizing investors. But before you give your shares away, consider these facts. Groupon has no debt, over 1 billion in cash, and an astronomical revenue projection in 2013. Earnings growth for 2012 is estimated at 97%. In 2013, earnings growth is forecasted off the chart at 975% as international growth kicks in to warp drive.From a technical perspective, Groupon could easily rally back to $15 before encountering any serious resistance. Even at $15 the price is still attractive and could grind up to about 18.50 before encountering serious resistance.(Click to enlarge)Earnings release for Q1 is scheduled for May 14th, and I suspect the smart short sellers are already headed for the exit. Thursday, May 3rd, Groupon dipped slightly below $10, but heavy short covering and bargain hunters forced an afternoon reversal to close well off the low at 10.31. After hours price action traded up to the 10.70 range before settling at 10.45.Is the bottom in? Is Groupon a buy? Maybe and yes, respectively. But don't be surprised if you hear a lot of trash talk on Friday. All the bad news was in the stock at $15. The last $5 dollars down was unwarranted.Disclosure: I am long GRPN."
507591,24714,2012-04-18T14:27:35-04:00,,"Groupon (GRPN) shares closed at $24.58 at the close of February 8th trading. At the close of April 17th, the share price dropped to $12.58, down 48.8 percent. During this time, we have seen Groupon miss earnings and then have to restate earnings, but the vast majority of the drop came from a consistent bearish influence during a time where the Nasdaq was up 4.34 percent. In this article, I explain why I think Groupon's bear run may end for now, but investors should still be wary going forward.Groupon has been tagged as ""the fastest growing company ever."" The company reported $1.61 billion in revenue in 2011, which is a 952.4 percent annualized increase over its 2009 revenue. However, many critics, including myself, believe that Groupon IPO'd at way too high of a valuation because of its lack of earnings, potential competition, and sketchy accounting.Groupon has never reported a profitable quarter, but that is supposed to change soon. Analysts expect Groupon to report earnings per share of $0.01 in the first quarter of 2012, and if there is another miss, the company should be profitable in quarter two with expected earnings per share of $0.04. Groupon is expected to be a fairly profitable company by 2013 with expected annual EPS of $0.77. If its $12.58 share price stays constant, that would give Groupon a P/E ratio of 16.34, which is fairly reasonable.What has turned off investors as of late is that the prospect of Groupon meeting its expectations is turning into a very big ""if."" Groupon is already the largest daily deals site in almost every developed country on Earth, so how is it going to make $3.01 billion in revenue in 2013 if it only made $1.61 billion in 2011? It is very likely that Groupon, or daily deals as a whole, may just be a passing trend and we're looking at the company's peak.The reason why I believe Groupon will stop its bear run for the time being is two-fold. First, the stock price has come down to Earth and its expected future earnings better support its current stock price. Second, I believe the peak of tech bubble 2.0 is yet to come and upcoming events like the Facebook (FB) IPO may cause all of the tech darlings' shares to be bullish. Groupon is a bargain compared with the $1 billion purchase of Instagram. However, a lot rides on its May 14th earnings call. Investors will want to see black numbers, and a quarterly loss could send the stock plummeting.Today I came across a Kozmo.com reference and the company reminded me so much of Groupon's short history. Kozmo.com was founded in 1998 and was liquidated in 2001. In 1999, the company lost $26.3 million on $3.5 million in revenue. In this same year, it raised $250 million from investors, including a $60 million investment from Amazon (AMZN). Although Groupon's business model is much more far reaching and much closer to being a successful company, it was a harsh reminder of how dot coms that show a lot of potential can come crashing down. I recommend not going long on shares right now, but it is also a good time to ease off of short positions, as I believe that Groupon has finished its bleeding, for now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
505501,20809,2012-04-18T02:23:52-04:00,,"This week, in an attempt to refocus the legions of Groupon employees in a Google-like fashion, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) management has introduced the company's new mantra, designed (like Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG)) to be Grouponer's moral compass going forward. After much internal debate among top executives, it appears that the simpler and more concise ""Be Evil"" has trumped ""Don't Not Be Evil"" as the new corporate mantra.In other developments, it appears that Darth Vader is no longer being considered for the unfilled slot on Groupon's board after CEO Mason nixed the idea when a partial viewing of Star Wars Episode 6 left Mason concerned that ""Vader may have lost his focus."" OK, so maybe it's not really quite that bad, but it seems that everything I see, hear and read about Groupon these days is trying to convince me that Groupon is evil, that it is going bankrupt, that everyone hates Groupon, yada, yada, yada.There has been a parade of bad news and daily articles taking Groupon management, its board of directors and anyone who publicly claims to use Groupons (without seeking a return more than 60 days later) to task. Is there anything negative about Groupon that hasn't already been said? It seems that Groupon has evolved into the Bizarro Priceline (PCLN), with each day bringing more negative commentary, a new 52 week low on its stock and new analyst reports lowering the price target because it just traded below the old target low. GRPN has recorded a new 52 week low in each of the past four trading sessions and is now down over 50% from where it closed trading on its offering day, with Tuesday's new historical low of $12.25.Given the negativity surrounding anything Groupon related, it's not as surprising that there were 23,338,658 shares sold short as of the settlement date of March 30. However, investors should note that GRPN was trading in the $18 - $19 per share range when that measure was taken. In the two weeks since that time, the stock has fallen another 30% on fairly heavy trading volume and an onslaught of negative articles and commentary.Given the trading action since that time, it is quite likely that the next short interest report will show short interest has risen to the highest level in the company's short history, likely exceeding 25 million shares sold short, despite the fact that the stock is now trading 53% off the closing price on its IPO day. If there are over 25 million shares sold short, it would take close to three full weeks at current trading volumes (1.7m average last two days trading volume) with 100% of the transactions being buys to cover this short position.Groupon management has clearly made some bad decisions along the way, particularly with how they chose to report their results to investors and the timing of some of those bad decisions. However, it appears that this is now fully baked into Groupon's valuation, possibly even a bit overdone. What will happen if the company issues some kind of positive news? What if GRPN's $8B market cap and 220% growth since their $6B offer entices Google to make a new offer?What if the management team that created one of the most amazing business success stories in U.S. corporate history decides that the negativity surrounding the free fall in its stock price is starting to have a substantive impact on its day to day operations (less engagement with merchants as they start perceiving negativity, employees being less motivated etc.) and decides to focus its energies on turning that around? What if next month CEO Mason announces the company will reduce marketing expenditures in Q2, allowing investors to better see the earnings potential of the existing user base and thus offer significantly better expectations for Q2 than analysts have been predicting?Even if none of these scenarios materialize, it still seems likely that there will be some point at which traders will recognize that the sentiment has gotten so ridiculously negative and there are so many selling short that any small shift in sentiment will allow for a double digit return almost overnight.This is why I am buying Groupon. In the mean time, the ""over the top"" negativity, exploding short interest, oversold technical indicators and everything else suggests this is a pretty good short term trade that could turn out to be an opportunity to buy into one of the greatest growth stories in American corporate history at valuation metrics that are cheaper than what Google was willing to pay in late 2010 if Groupon management executes.Disclosure: I am long GRPN."

We calculate its Days Payables Outstanding for 2011 by dividing the average of its beginning and ending Accounts Payables over the period by its Average Cost of Sales per day.Here are the figures for Groupon for 2011:Source: Groupon 10-K, 2011, $ in thousandsSo Groupon has a negative cash conversion of -52 days. In essence, it is a business that gets paid to make money. It is funded by its suppliers. Other notable businesses that have a negative cash conversion cycle are Amazon (AMZN) and Dell (DELL), both incredibly efficient in their generation of cash. Moreover, Groupon also has accounts payables for its merchant partners. It pays its merchants much later than it receives money from its customers. Here are the total payable numbers after including the Merchant Payables [MP].Source: Groupon 10-K, 2011, $ in thousandsHere the CCC is -534 days, a mind-boggling negative year and a half of ""free loan"" of cash for its payables. Note that these payable do not include ""Accrued Expenses"" with the much discussed return reserves, set at $67,452 in the 2011 balance sheet. Including this would further lengthen the negative CCC.What about the reserves?One issue that has been highlighted by the issue of material deficiency in Groupon's 10-K is its reserves for returns. As Felix Salmon points out, Groupon has booked only 1.69% of its total revenue (Groupon calls this ""gross billings"") for its return reserves and may incur more liability if its return rate is higher, since the merchant may already have been paid beforehand. There are two factors to note about this. Firstly, this situation only applies to Groupon's North American business since, according to the 10-K ""In our International segment, merchant partners are not paid until the customer redeems the Groupon.""What percent of revenues is Groupon booking from international sales? From its 10-K:So based on these figures, international revenues have increased from 0% in 2009 to over 60% in 2011. This 60% of the business does not have the issue of the liability overhang from the merchant being paid in advance of the Groupon being used, which has been the major ding against the company. Furthermore international revenues are expected to go up as a percentage of overall revenues. Note that total return reserves as a percent of 2011 North American revenues (not ""gross billings"") are more than 10%. Anecdotally, I have personally bought many Groupon deals, far above their average sales per customer, and have immensely enjoyed each one of them and have yet to experience buyer's remorse on even a single transaction. To me, the Groupon Promise is a net positive. As long as Groupon continues to delight its users, the merchants are sure to follow.Overall, Groupon is a rapidly growing business that has the capacity to throws out an amazing amount of cash. For a business growing at a nearly 100% run rate it is trading at nearly 4x forward revenues. Note that these revenues have a gross margin of over 80%. For 2011, it generated $290+ million of cash from operations and is trading at 30x trailing cash flow. It would not be surprising to see its double its cash from operations in 2012 over 2011 and generate over 600 million of operating cash flow. There are legitimate questions of how long this torrid growth can continue, but at these numbers, Groupon is a strong buy. Conservative investors may want to buy call options or use bull call spreads to benefits from Groupon's growth while limiting downside.Groupon has gone down far too quickly, based mainly on fear. A positive surprise in the next earnings report on May 15, 2012 could easily return it back to where it was trading just two weeks ago at $18+. One trade we like is buying calls expiring on May 19, 2012 or setting up May call spreads. Buying May calls with a strike price of 15 and selling calls with a strike price of 18 currently cost around 50c per call spread position and can yield $2.50 (500%) in profit if the stock closes at or above $18 at expiry. Note that if the stock closes below 15 at expiry you will lose your entire investment if you hold till then. You may be able to profit without holding to expiration if the stock rises between then and now. Longer term investors may buy long-term calls or set up bull-call diagonal spreads or purchase the shares outright at these prices.Disclosure:  I have bull call spreads on GRPN."

The issue at hand is that of refunds, and how they’re accounted for. Let’s say that Groupon has managed to sell 240 coupons for “cool sculpting”, at $500 apiece. That’s a total of $120,000. The coupons expire on September 19, in six months’ time.Let’s also assume that, as per usual, Groupon keeps 50% of the proceeds, and gives the other 50% to the merchant. In this case, it would keep $60,000 for itself, and remit $60,000 to Dr. Aron Kressel. But Dr. Kressel wouldn’t get all the money up front. He gets one third, or $20,000, immediately. He gets another $20,000 after 30 days. And then he gets the final $20,000 after 60 days. That’s May 18.Now, Kressel might not get all of his $60,000. Let’s say that some of the people who bought a coupon turn up for their initial consultation before May 18, and are told that they’re not medically suitable for the treatment and therefore can’t have it. Those people — let’s say there are 20 of them — are eligible for a full refund from Groupon. So Groupon gives those people back their money, $10,000 in all, and holds back from Kressel his $5,000 share of that money. As a result, Kressel’s final payment is not $20,000 but rather $15,000, and he ends up getting paid $55,000 in total by Groupon.And at the same time, of course, Groupon’s own revenues from the deal are also reduced to $55,000: the economics of selling 240 coupons and refunding 20 of them before May 18 are basically the same as the economics of selling 220 coupons and refunding none of them.After May 18, however, things change. At that point, Kressel is paid out, but Groupon still has the Groupon Promise. As a result, if anybody gets turned away from Kressel’s office after May 18, Groupon eats the whole refund. Let’s say that appointments become easier to come by after May 18, and a further 50 people end up being told that they’re not eligible for the procedure after that point. Remember that Kressel has already been paid $250 by each of those people, and doesn’t need to repay the money if he finds them ineligible.Those 50 people still get their refunds from Groupon — a total of $25,000. But in this case, all of that $25,000 comes out of Groupon’s share of the revenues, and none of it comes out of Kressel’s cut.So what’s the situation on September 19, when the deal expires? 240 coupons will have been sold, for an up-front total of $120,000. 70 of those coupons will have been refunded, bringing total revenues down by $35,000 to $85,000. And of those revenues, Kressel will have received $55,000, while Groupon will have received just $30,000 — a 65/35 split in favor of the merchant, rather than the 50/50 split originally envisioned.And in fact it’s possible for Groupon to lose money on the deal, if there are enough refunds after May 18.How is all this accounted for?The way that Groupon does its accounting, it adds up its share of the gross revenues — that would be $60,000 in the cool sculpting example — and books it as revenue immediately, minus the quantity of refunds it expects to have to issue after applying a model which tries to predict such things. If you look at Groupon’s new 10-K, you’ll find this chart (click on “Notes to Financial Statements” and then “Accrued Expenses”):(Click to enlarge)The line you want to look at here is “refunds reserve” — the number which was $13.9 million in 2010, and $67.5 million in 2011. If you add up all of the deals that Groupon issued in 2010 — that’s some $745 million in total — Groupon reckons that it’s going to have to refund $13.9 million, or 1.87%.Then, in 2011, a lot of things changed at Groupon. It sold a lot more deals than in 2010, for starters. It also moved into higher-priced deals, things like cool sculpting, which are more likely to be refunded. And it started selling travel deals, too, which are also more likely to get people asking for refunds, especially if they turn out not to be able to book travel on the days they want.So in 2011, out of $3.985 billion in total revenues, Groupon reserved $67.452 million for refunds. Now note these are the revised figures, which were released after Groupon realized that its initial estimates for refunds were too low.But do the math, and it turns out that $67.452 million is just 1.69% of $3.985 billion — the anticipated refund rate actually fell from 2010 to 2011. This does not make much sense, since by all accounts — including Groupon’s — it should by rights have gone up, quite substantially.Now there’s an easy way of dealing with this problem, which doesn’t involve any predictive algorithms at all. Here’s Monga:This, then, is probably what the SEC is investigating at Groupon. If it sells 240 coupons for cool sculpting, should it book $60,000 in revenue? Or $50,000? Or $30,000? The fact is that Groupon doesn’t know how much if any money it’s going to end up making from that deal until the deal expires in September. So there’s a case to be made that the company shouldn’t book any revenue at all until September, just to be on the safe side.What happened with the earnings restatement is that Groupon discovered that the refund reserve it had been using was too low; when it increased that reserve, it ended up losing more money than it had originally reported. But should it have booked any revenue at all, so long as that revenue was subject to potential refund? I have a feeling that the SEC is going to be asking Groupon that question in quite a pointed manner."
475201,24946,2012-04-03T09:23:38-04:00,,"In an article I published on February 8th, I took a closer look at social media stocks in light of Facebook's soon-to-be glorious IPO.All the social media stocks appeared way overvalued, to say the least, but my final recommendation was not to short any of them because the trend can be their friend and we might incur substantial losses by following this course of action. In other words, it is always risky to short stocks based solely on valuation.Over the past 2 months, all the social media stocks have experienced great volatility: LinkedIn (LNKD) skyrocketed by over 20%, Yelp Inc.(YELP) and Angie's List, Inc. (ANGI) have risen by 15% while Zinga (ZNGA) and groupon (GRPN) both lost some value.I believe now is the time to short GRPN, and that is for the following reasons:Overly rich valuationsLets take a closer look at some of the valuations of the recent social media IPOs:A malfunctioning business modelThe coupon business model of Groupon is falling apart for several reasons:Accounting GimmicksOn March 30th, GRPN reported that it was revising its previously reported revenue of $506ML by $14.3ML.What this basically means is that the company has suffered a high rate of refunds. It is imperative to understand that this error does not end with refunds. It means that the company does not have its risk controls intact. Very problematic for a company whose main business is to manage receivables.This was not the first encounter of GRPN with the SEC. In its pre IPO phase, the company misleadingly disclosed the total number of customers having ever bought a Groupon offer in a portion of the S-1 clearly reserved for quarterly results.As you can see, this company is an immediate suspect of accounting gimmicks.Technical FrontThe stock has lost approximately 15% in the past week. While doing so, it violated the 50 day EMA of 18.8, and broke through several support lines at - 18.9 and 16.9 heading towards the ultimate support at 14.85. The price of 14.85 is likely to make-or-break the upcoming trend. You will see that the rate of decrease will speed up as soon as the 14.8 is broken on the way downwards.The contrarian viewSome might say that the company has already paid for its sins. In fact, it might have actually over-paid: $1BL was lost in market share value for a 4 cent per-share crime. I, on the other hand, believe that there is an explosive combination of valuation issues together with accounting gimmicks that will eventually lead to the demise of GRPN.What's an investor to do?Short GRPN at prices between $14 and $17. Place a tight stop loss at $19 to avoid losses due to volatility, while allowing the winner to run. Take profit at $10.1 to avoid a round number.Disclosure: I am short GRPN."
489991,22271,2012-04-10T18:31:52-04:00,,"There is no such thing as a free lunch.Groupon (GRPN), as much as I would love to see it flourish, is indeed, finished. With Groupon, the stage was set for a cadre of plucky Midwesterners to prove that they could finally step up to the plate and compete against Silicon Valley California techies, Silicon Alley New York hipsters, Route 128 Boston Ivy Leaguers, and polished Fairfax-Montgomery County government contract offices in the high-stakes technology game. Although noble with his intent, I am doubtful that Groupon founder Andrew Mason will be able to convert his deal distribution idea into serious profits. Groupon is well on the road to bankruptcy, and is doomed to serve as yet another Economics 101 case study in bubble economics.Put on your black suits, shades, and hard bottoms. The reaper is coming.The Groupon Business ModelGroupon functions as an online intermediary that matches its army of deal-seeking consumer subscribers against local businesses that are offering discounts - in hopes of generating an immediate spike in sales alongside increased long-term demand for their services. As the middleman, Groupon splits incoming revenue and fees between merchants, in exchange for helping them to market their goods through online coupons and promotions.According to technology consultant Rocky Agrawal, it is within our best interests to treat the Chicago firm as a ""subprime lender,"" instead of merely accepting its coupon business model at face value. Indeed, Groupon's smoke-and-mirror accounting practices can only accelerate its demise, as investors struggle to interpret financial statements that closely resemble a Chicago Hillside Strangler interchange of revenue, refunds, and confusing ""adjusted consolidated segment operating income"" bridges to nowhere. Similar to the subprime crisis, it is only a matter of time before the Groupon business model is completely exposed, and its shares collapse towards zero and oblivion.Rather than operating as a conduit for repeat customers to local businesses, Andrew Mason and company have created a bourgeoning class of savvy Web 2.0 coupon clippers, who capitalize upon the hottest daily deal at the expense of sustained consumer loyalty. In Chicago, the Groupon crowd runs the streets on a nightly basis for a taste of fine dining at Rush Street, Michigan Avenue, and the West Loop. It is obvious to all, from the regulars to the maitre d', that Cool Disco Dan in his fresh blazer and skinny jeans will never again set foot in this restaurant  without his $20 coupon for a five course meal plus drinks.Profitable enterprises will quickly realize that up-front cash flow from the Groupon crowd is merely a high-interest rate loan that cannot be leveraged into future earnings growth - and refuse to participate. Over time, the Groupon salesforce will be forced to compete against slick talking mob boss loan sharks in zoot suits - as the lender of last resort to struggling business owners.History has proven that only gangsters, of course, can survive this subprime loan shark business, because they have the artillery to strictly enforce their ""no refunds"" policy and collect interest on demand.Party Like It's 1999: The Web 2.0 BubbleYet, again, Wall Street has lost touch with any semblance of reality. According to Wall Street market capitalization, Groupon is a $9 billion business. Groupon, however, has never turned a profit. In fact, this coupon dealer is showing a trend of widening losses against larger revenues throughout its brief history of existence. Although reported revenue has tracked an impossible trajectory from $94,000 in 2008 to well over $1.5 billion in 2011, operating expenses have also snowballed from $1.6 million to $1.8 billion during this same time frame. After taxes, the end result calculates out to show a $373.5 million net loss, or a $1.03 loss per share.Of course, all of these numbers can be taken with a grain of salt, as Groupon brass must now battle against a Pandora's box of SEC probes, class action lawsuits, and inevitable restructuring at the top - in response to their own accounting shenanigans and lack of internal controls. In reality, I would surmise that Groupon tallied a $750 million loss in 2011.  First, Groupon has booked all of the cash received for its coupons as its own revenue, instead of accurately splitting those dollars between itself and outside participating merchants. Secondly, Groupon has failed to set aside enough reserves to deal with a slew of inevitable refunds from irate consumers who have purchased coupons on big-ticket items that failed to deliver. As an intelligent investor, I cannot justify any valuation for Groupon's shares that is one penny above zero.The End of the RoadI am afraid that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its looming May 2012 IPO will mark the capstone event for this Web 2.0 bubble. It is only a matter of time before Web 2.0 bubble stocks, such as Millennial Media (MM), Zynga (ZNGA), and Groupon unceremoniously implode beneath the weight of unrealistic expectations, insurmountable losses, and drying wells of investor capital. When the smoke clears, only Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) alongside small, privately held niche sites, will be left standing as the real Internet players who can regularly turn profits amid the rubble.Going forward, I feel that inflation expectations will accelerate the carnage. Inevitably, creditors will demand interest rates above the rate of inflation to generate real returns. At that point, money will flow out of equities and into fixed income, which will be the death knell of faltering stocks such as Groupon. The Fed will be helpless to contain the looming Web 2.0 collapse, because it has already ran out of ammunition to prop up the U.S. economy, as evidenced by its current zero interest rate regime and obscene $2 trillion balance sheet.This is raw, survival-of-the-fittest capitalism. Groupon is finished. It's the end of the Web 2.0 world as we know it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
469831,22762,2012-03-30T23:02:35-04:00,,"By Colleen TaylorDaily deals site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) today issued a pretty significant revision of the financial results it previously reported for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2011.According to the company, it actually made $14.3 million less in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2011 than it previously reported  — $492.2 million, compared to the previously stated $506.5 million. It  also spent more in operating expenses than it previously said it did —  resulting in its Q4 operating income and net income being $30 million  and $22.6 million less, respectively, than the company initially said it  was.How did this mixup occur? Groupon said in a filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the revisions “are  primarily related to an increase to the Company’s refund reserve accrual  to reflect a shift in the Company’s fourth quarter deal mix and higher  price point offers, which have higher refund rates.” (Full disclosure:  I’m not sure what that means.)Not surprisingly, Wall Street was none too happy about the news.  Groupon issued the revision on Friday afternoon after trading stopped  for the week, but at the moment (2:45 PM Pacific Time) the company’s  stock price is down 6.4 percent in after-hours trading. The company’s  stock price as of market close today was $18.38, which was already well  below the $20 share price of its initial public offering back in October.Groupon’s accounting practices have raised many eyebrows  in the tech and business worlds, particularly in the run-up to its  stock market debut last fall, so this is not a completely unexpected  situation. Going forward, though, the company vows that it has its  financial house in order. Groupon’s CFO Jason Child said in a press release  today: “We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business, as our  performance continues to highlight the value that we provide to  customers and merchants.”Original post"
470311,28311,2012-04-01T04:37:48-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) was forced to restate fourth quarter earnings, sending its  stock down 6% in after-hours trading. This surprised me as much as my $2  investment in the Mega Millions jackpot not paying off.The reasons for Groupon’s restatement were higher refund reserves and  weakness in internal controls. These are issues I’ve repeatedly  discussed. I raised them directly with Groupon PR in September (back  when they still would speak to me) and I was assured that refunds  weren’t an issue for Groupon.I also spoke with a former Groupon salesperson who claimed he was  fired because he raised concerns about poor internal systems that didn’t  track deals correctly and complaints about poor risk management when it  comes to running deals.So what’s happening at the coupon company?Well, for starters, it’s not a coupon company nor a marketing  company. At its core, Groupon’s U.S. business is a receivables factoring  business, as I wrote last year. They give loans to small businesses at a  very steep rate (the price of the discount plus Groupon’s commission).  They get the money to fund these loans from credit card companies such  as Chase Paymentech. Groupon is essentially a sub-prime lender that does  zero risk assessment. And as word continues to spread about what a  terrible deal running a Groupon is for many categories of businesses,  the ones that will choose to run Groupons are the ones that are the most  desperate. For U.S. based businesses, the only time I can definitely  recommend running a Groupon is if it is otherwise going to go out of  business.Another factor is that Groupon is selling bigger and bigger deals and  many of these have requirements for use. Some deals have medical  qualifications. The former salesperson told me about Groupons for a  procedure called “cool sculpting”.  In this procedure, fat is frozen off the body. In order to get the  treatment, patients must be medically qualified. But Groupon has no way  of medically qualifying purchasers and will sell it to anyone. When they  go to the doctor and find out that they aren’t eligible, they call  Groupon for a refund. If this is several months later, after Groupon has  paid out the entirety of what it owes the provider, this can mean a  refund loss for Groupon.Travel is another risky category for Groupon. Unlike Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE),  Travelocity, Priceline (PCLN), Jetsetter and nearly every other major travel  provider, Groupon does not require consumers to pick their dates and  confirm availability at the time of purchase. When a consumer finds he  can’t use his Groupon months later, he calls for a refund. Groupon also hides material restrictions on travel deals, something I pointed out in September and Groupon still hasn’t rectified.Because these are higher ticket items that cost hundreds or thousands  of dollars, consumers are more likely to ask for a refund than on lower  ticket items. In the short term, it means a revenue boost to Groupon,  which the company needs as its once torrid growth itself cools. In the  long term, it means refund losses.The “Groupon Promise” is another risk factor. It’s an overly broad  promise designed to allay consumers’ concern about using Groupons.  Because it is so broad, it results in higher refund rates than would  otherwise be the case.Yet another concern is that Groupon does not track how much  outstanding Groupon “debt” there is. There is no one in the world who  can tell you how many and how much Groupon value is outstanding. Unlike typical gift card sales,  Groupon books revenue immediately and then does not show the Groupons  on its balance sheet. By my estimates, Groupon has between $500 million  and $750 million in liabilities that it doesn’t show on its balance  sheet.In theory, Groupon’s exposure to that risk is covered by its refund  reserves — but we don’t know the size of those reserves. And as  yesterday’s restatement shows, they’ve calculated them poorly. Unless  Groupon begins to do risk assessment on deals before they run, changes  its payout terms to businesses or drastically changes its refund  policies, I expect refund rates to continue to rise. If they do any of  those things, I expect revenue declines because it will make running  Groupons less attractive to businesses and buying Groupons less  attractive to consumers.Groupon has also worked hard to hide their refund rates. While going  through their S-1 process last year, Groupon continually revised its  accounting. At one point, I discovered a way to calculate their refund  rates and found that refund rates had likely increased more than 40% year-over-year. In the next amendment to their S-1, they changed their accounting again to bury that data.Investors should also be concerned about the fact that Groupon’s lock  up should end in early May, releasing a lot more shares on to the  market. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Groupon trading in single digits  after that and heading to zero within the next 36 months. Groupon’s best  bet is if they can acquire their way into a sustainable business model;  I’m doubtful that will happen considering the companies they have  purchased to date.With its restatement, Groupon said that its guidance for the first  quarter remained the same as earlier. Given that their lockup should end  shortly before they report first quarter results, I would take that  assessment with a mine full of salt."
469821,21950,2012-03-30T22:19:36-04:00,,"After traders packed up for the weekend, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) issued two warnings during the evening of March 30th.First, Groupon discovered it under-estimated its refund rate for the previous quarter. As a result, the company revised downward its revenue and earnings numbers:This means GRPN actually had a greater loss for the last quarter. GRPN claims in its 10K filing released in parallel with the restatement that it has fixed its refund model to include a change in deal mix and higher priced offers. GRPN does not indicate whether these shifts represent a one-time change or an on-going, dynamic change. GRPN is holding firm on its guidance for the current quarter, so the company is implying the shift could be temporary and/or seasonal/cyclical. It is of course possible GRPN got blindsided with a higher number of low-quality merchants. For now, I expect overall refund rates to trend upward, and I expect analysts to ask a lot of questions about this during the next conference call. Refund dynamics will get the spotlight as a source of potential uncertainty in GRPN's revenues and profits.Second, GRPN warned that it ""..identified a material weakness in [its] internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements."" The details are included in the company's 10K filing. GRPN is now expanding the scope of a review of its internal controls mandated by its IPO filing so that it can understand the source of the weakness and fix it. The 10K makes it clear that the conclusion of this review could uncover more financial surprises at an as yet undetermined time:Until this issue is resolved, the implied risk premium for GRPN grows larger. GRPN's stock dropped as much as 10% in after-hours trading. Curiously, GRPN's stock rallied into these revelations.(Click to enlarge)This latest news just increased my skepticism regarding GRPN's stock, and I continue to recommend investors avoid it. The press release does contain one small bit of good news for stockholders who do find value in these shares: GRPN extended its lockup period from May 2nd to June 1, 2012. That is a one-month delay for an event that will likely generate immense selling pressure as insiders rush to take profits while they still exist.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I am short GRPN.Additional disclosure: I am short GRPN through put options"
443651,22762,2012-03-19T15:50:51-04:00,,"By Rip EmpsonSince its big IPO last year,  Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been picking up the pace of international expansion. Today,  for example, we were tipped by an email written by Groupon Co-founder and  CEO Andrew Mason  to Groupon employees, which announced some big changes to international  management, specifically in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and  Latin America.Regardless of the fact that Groupon scooped up at least six startups since November (including Mertado, Adku, Campfire Labs, Hyperpublic, Kima Labs, and Uptake), taking a look at Groupon’s first earnings report as a public company,  one will find that the company lost $350 million in 2011 — not because  of marketing or M&A spend — but because of its “very aggressive  international expansion” efforts.In his email to employees, dated February 29, the Groupon CEO  revealed that the company announced a new organizational structure for  EMEA this past December, “promoting seven of [its] best country  Managing Directors to International VPs, overseeing different regions of  EMEA, and reporting directly into Marc Samwer, our head of  International.”This international management is becoming increasingly important to  Groupon, as 7,000 of its 10,000 employees are now stationed outside of  the U.S., and the chain of command leads directly up the ladder to Marc  Samwer. At the annual DLD confab in Munich,  David Kirkpatrick asked the Groupon CEO about the supposed “problem” of  giving two of the Samwer brothers so much control over the way it expands internationally, to which the CEO replied:Nonetheless, Groupon struggled with its entrance into China and  as a result, there has been a lot of attention from investors and  analysts paid to the discrepancy between its business in the U.S. and  abroad. But, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Conference last month, Mason attributed this to the fact that the company is “farther along technologically” in the U.S. than it is abroad.However, the CEO was optimistic that this is beginning to change,  partly because of Groupon’s plans to roll out deal personalization  overseas, among other things. Furthermore, on Friday, the Office of Fair  Trading (the U.K.’s version of the Federal Trade Commission) cracked  down on Groupon Britain for what it considered “widespread breaches of  consumer protection regulations,” including the way in which Groupon’s  British arm is dealing with reference pricing, advertising, refunds,  promoting unfair terms, and the diligence of its interactions with  merchants. (More from GigaOm here.)In response, Groupon announced that it would be making the changes that the Office of Fair Trading suggested, including to pricing and and advertising,  and Groupon Communications Director Julie Mossler said that the company  had actually been in the process of making those changes before the  government’s ruling came down.While there are clearly issues with meeting regulations in the U.K.  (and perhaps management issues), Groupon believes in the potential of  its overseas businesses and the strength of leadership. Such that Mason  said in his email to Groupon employees (dated the 28th of February) that  it is applying the same structure the company has used in Europe, the  Middle East, and Africa — the one led by the Samwer brothers — to Latin  America.This includes a number of executive-level changes among its  international ranks, including hiring Patrick Schmidt as VP of Latin  America. Schmidt is formerly co-CEO (and co-founder) of Groupon  Australia/New Zealand.According to Mason:In addition to hiring Schmidt as VP of Latin America, Mason announced  that Miguel Queimado will become CEO of Groupon Brazil, where he will  report to Schmidt. Queimado has been living in Portugal, where he has  worked for the last three and a half years for McKinsey, leading  projects in Portugal and Angola.Of course, this means that the founders of both Groupon Latin  America, and Groupon Brazil, specifically, are out and will be taking  new positions within the company. Oskar Hjertonsson, the founder of  Groupon Latin America and Florian Otto, the Founder and CEO of Groupon  Brazil, will be helping to lead the new transition to new leadership  over the next several months, Mason said. Then Hjertonsson will be  serving Groupon “in a to-be-determined role from his new home in San  Francisco, and Otto will join the global corporate development team.”In light of The Next Web’s report  that the third largest Groupon competitor in Brazil, Peixe Urbano,  acquired its second largest, Groupalia, Groupon will be getting some  more heated competition going forward from its merged competitors. Both  trailed Groupon in traction in LatAm, according to comScore, but not by much, and the merger significantly strengthens the company’s position in the region.Groupon has already spent a great deal trying to push its model in  international markets, and Mason’s talk at the Goldman Sachs Conference  implied that just based on the size of its brand in the U.S., it  shouldn’t be too difficult to snatch up market share abroad. But with  its stumbling in China, issues in the U.K., and growing competition in  Latin America, it falls on its new leaders to make sure the rising  international expenditures aren’t for naught.Original post"

Groupon found material weaknesses in its internal accounting controls.Accounting restatementsThe revisions that the company made were related to an ""increase in the refund reserve account and reflects a shift in the deal mix and higher price point offers"". Essentially it means that customers where unhappy with their purchases and requested more in refunds from Groupon.As a result, the company restated its fourth quarter earnings by over $22 million which leads to a restatement and a loss of $65 million for the final quarter, or $0.12 per share. Revenues were restated from $506 million to $492 million.The issue was found by its independent auditor Ernst & Young which noted the internal weakness in internal control for financial reporting. The company responded by hiring another external auditor to run through its accounting practices.Last September, the company shocked the investment community by a restatement of its accounting practices. After the accounting revision, the company had to report a 55% decline in its revenue. This latest restatement feeds the negative sentiment regarding the financial disclosure of the company as it had to restate its financial statements for the second time in six months.OutlookGroupon previously issued a revenue outlook of $510-$550 million for the first quarter of 2012. Income from operations is expected to come in at $15-$35 million. The latest revision of the accounting statements for the fourth quarter of 2011 has no consequences for the previously issued outlook for the first quarter. Analyst are expecting Groupon to generate $534 million in revenue for the first quarter and expect the company to generate net profit of $23 million.Valuation Incorporating a 6% decline in after-hours trading, the market values Groupon at roughly $11 billion. Excluding cash and equivalents of little over $1 billion, this values the company at 6.2 times annual revenue in the year in which the company lost $257 million.What justifies this valuation? Stellar growth.For the second half of 2011 the company generated $935 million, compared to $690 million for the first half year. Net losses for the second half declined to $53 million compared to $204 million in the first half. At this pace the company is on track to continue revenue growth for 2012 and report an annual profit for the first time in its history.Investment ThesisGroupon continues to report stellar revenue growth and will most likely return to profit in 2012. Despite this good news shares trade roughly 10% below its initial public offering price as shares have reacted on the revision of accounting statements, an increase in refund reserves and problems with merchants and customers as the quality of offerings is sometimes outright bad.In a mere three years Groupon has grown from inception to a multi-billion company which is an enormous achievement. If the company can resolve accounting issues and quality issues which are a result of growing pains, it may deserve a higher valuation and should recover to levels above its initial public offering price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
474131,20991,2012-04-02T20:45:46-04:00,,"I bought  Rocky Agrawal brunch on Saturday, at a cost to myself somewhat smaller  than the amount I’m going to have to shell out if I lose my bet  with him. Which is looking increasingly likely. I lose the bet if  Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) market capitalization on October 31 is less than 30% of the  market capitalization of Priceline (PCLN). When Groupon went public, the ratio  was 72%,  which gave me a very healthy cushion. But as of today, I’m underwater:  the ratio is now just 24%, thanks in large part to an astonishing and  quite unexpected run-up in Priceline’s stock, which is now comfortably  over $700 per share.Still, the proximate cause of the ratio dropping below 30% came from Groupon, not Priceline: it revised its 2011 results downwards,  in a pretty opaque manner. “The revisions are primarily related to an  increase to the Company’s refund reserve accrual to reflect a shift in  the Company’s fourth quarter deal mix and higher price point offers,  which have higher refund rates,” says the press release, in a marked  departure from Groupon’s normal habit of communicating in plain English.The official SEC filing is a tiny bit clearer:Groupon is explaining how it accounts for the money it sets aside to cover customer refunds.Groupon basically has two business models: the US model, and the  European model. In the US, Groupon sells a bunch of deals for a given  merchant, gets lots of revenue as a result, keeps roughly half that  revenue for itself, and then passes on the other half to the merchant in  question. In Europe, by contrast, Groupon keeps the merchant’s share of  the revenue until such time as the buyer redeems the Groupon.Obviously, the US model is much more attractive to merchants than the  European model is. But it also creates much bigger dangers for Groupon,  thanks to Groupon’s refund policy. “If the experience using your Groupon ever lets you down, we’ll make it right or return your purchase. Simple as that.”That policy is good business for Groupon: it gives people a lot of  confidence to buy a Groupon for merchants who might otherwise seem a bit  sketchy. But it also creates dangers, because if Groupon does a deal  with a sketchy merchant, then Groupon can be on the hook for a lot of  refunds. And even if the merchant is entirely legitimate, if for good  reason a lot of people end up being disappointed with their deal,  Groupon can still end up massively out of pocket.What happened in 2011 is that the price of Groupons started going up —  and it turns out that Groupon ends up issuing refunds on a  significantly higher percentage of high-ticket Groupons than it has  historically done on low-ticket Groupons. I’ll let Rocky explain why:Pretty much all of these problems could be addressed quite simply if  Groupon simply moved its high-ticket US sales to a European-style system  where it paid the merchant only after the deal was successfully  redeemed. If Groupon hasn’t done that, then that implies that there  might be less merchant demand to run Groupon deals than Groupon likes to  imply — and that Groupon needs to be able to promise a large amount of  cash up front in order to be able to sign up the merchants it needs.Groupon, as an intermediary, is in the business of balancing the  interests of merchants and consumers. The problem with the high-value  tickets is that it’s trying to have it both ways: giving merchants a lot  of money up front, while also giving very strong consumer protections  to the people buying the deals. The result is enormous contingent  liabilities for the middleman — Agrawal estimates that Groupon has more  than half a billion dollars in liabilities which aren’t showing up on  its balance sheet.I suspect that what’s going to happen is that Groupon will start  tightening up its standard contract with high-ticket-price merchants, to  make it easier for Groupon to have recourse to the merchant when it  needs to issue a refund. Will that scare away the merchants Groupon  wants? If it does, then there are much deeper problems at Groupon than  simply refund issues. Because a Groupon without a steady supply of  merchants wanting to do deals would surely be a company in very big  trouble.Update: Groupon’s Mike Buckley calls to say  that only about a third of the money payable to the merchant is paid up  front, and that “a significant portion” is held back until the customer  actually redeems. And that as a result, Groupon never loses money on a  deal, it just ends up selling fewer than it originally thought. But  there are still some question marks over when exactly the merchant gets  the last payment, and whether it’s before the Groupon expires — I’m  hoping to nail those down shortly."
474241,20725,2012-04-03T01:13:19-04:00,,"There was a lot of hype about Groupon (GRPN) during the IPO phase. And rightfully so, Groupon owners wanted to create as much of a buzz as possible about the stock so they can get a very high market valuation of the company and more money in their pockets. However, times are tough now and after trading over $30 a share on the first day of trading, the stock is now trading at just over $16 a share as the bullishness about the company and business model has come down. Even now, assigning a value of $8.5 billion to the company seems foolish as Groupon has no competitive advantage that will stop any other company of entering the niche industry. For an idea of how extreme the valuation is, one doesn't have to go too far. The company is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 13.5. Even Google (GOOG), a highly successful internet company with a history of success is only trading at a 3.6 multiple. Apple (AAPL), the darling of the stock market, is trading at a price to book ratio of 6.2. This suggests that Groupon has much further south to go. Analysts, however, are very bullish on the stock with a consensus target of $25 a share, upside of over 50%. The big question is why are the analysts bullish? Are they just trying to bring more IPO business in the future for their investment bank by having a high valuation? Or do they actually believe the valuation they are assigning Groupon?To make matters worse, the company, just six months into its status as public company, already has discovered some accounting issues. Last week, the company revised Q4 results. The revisions resulted in a reduction to fourth quarter 2011 revenue of $14.3 million. The revisions also resulted in an increase to fourth quarter operating expenses that reduced operating income by $30.0 million, net income by $22.6 million, and earnings per share by $0.04. Groupon noted that the revisions are primarily related to an increase to the company's refund reserve accrual to reflect a shift in the company's fourth quarter deal mix and higher price point offers, which have higher refund rates. That, however, wasn't the end of Groupon's problems. The company also said that its independent auditor included a statement of a material weakness in its internal controls over its financial statement close process.I believe that the downside here is tremendous despite the stock already taking a near 50% haircut from its IPO price. My big concern here is what is the competitive advantage Groupon has that will protect it from other companies competing with Groupon? There are already plenty of coupon sites out there that are similar to Groupon. I would stay away from the stock for sure and actually consider it as a short here. Analysts are still too bullish on the stock and the hype from the IPO phase is still supporting the stock valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
373731,22762,2012-02-16T22:56:53-05:00,,"By Rip EmpsonAt the Goldman Sachs Internet and Technology Conference in San  Francisco Thursday, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) Founder and CEO Andrew Mason took to the  stage to talk about the daily deal behemoth’s newly-minted position as a  public company, its roller coaster ride both leading up to and since  its IPO, as well as plans for the future.There was a lot of pressure bearing down on Groupon in the months  leading up to its emergence on Nasdaq, with many grumbling about its  overvaluation and undercooked business model, among other things. After  listing its initial offering at $26 a share in November, the company’s  stock today has dropped to $20 a share, after a series of ups and downs.It also recently shared its first earnings report as a public  company, missing expectations, losing $350 million overall and seeing  $137 million in international operating losses. Most of this loss,  however, could be attributed to the company's aggressive international  expansion, as 70 percent of its some-10,000 employees are now overseas.Though one might be able to say this about any number of points in a  company’s history, it does seem that Groupon is entering a crucial phase  of its development. In just three years, it skyrocketed to domination  in the deals space, raised multiple massive rounds of funding, and  piloted a successful (and huge) IPO. The quiet period (pre-IPO was tough  on the company, exposing many of its inherent weaknesses, but  “toughening it up,” Mason said today.)That’s all well and good, but there are appallingly low barriers to  entry in the daily deals space, and while Groupon deserves much credit  maintaining a firm grasp on market share in spite of a slew of  competition (much of which has now receded), it must now transition from  Groupon 1.0 to Groupon 2.0. The company is well aware that it needs to  deliver longer-term value to both merchants and customers if it is to  continue outpacing competition.Groupon is focused on closing the redemption loop on its platform,  and enabling merchants to encourage repeat visits to their stores, and  distance itself from its reputation as platform that encourages bargain  hunting and not loyalty. Mason says that he and the team believe in the  success they’ve had in bringing marketing to small businesses, and that  they are eager to continue expanding on their mobile services by  shipping mobile devices with pre-installed merchant apps, for example,  that can be used by its merchants to track redemption and collect data  on customer spend.It has been piloting Groupon Rewards, a program that serves rewards  to repeat customers based on their credit card information, and Mason  said that he believes that the “paper model of redemption” is on its way  out.Over the last few quarters, Groupon has been spending an increasing  amount on international marketing efforts, and questions from the  audience brought up the discrepancy between the company’s U.S. business  and its international efforts. “There are big differences now in  Groupon’s business in the U.S. versus internationally,” Mason said, “but  we’ve seen the model work wherever we take it — besides China.” The  company’s efforts in China have been a widely-covered disaster, but Mason was firm in the belief that Groupon would still be successful elsewhere.He attributed some of its problems in international markets to the  fact that the company is just simply farther along technologically in  the U.S. “But that’s starting to change,” he said. Why? Well, the CEO  clearly has big hopes for rolling out deal personalization overseas, as  the company already serves personalized deals in the U.S. based on  location, gender, past buying behaviors, and other criteria.Up until now, Groupon hasn’t offered any of the same deal  personalization features on its international platform, but that will be  “starting to change later this quarter,” the Founder assured the crowd.  Groupon has taken an approach to global expansion that involves  replicating its playbook in city after city, but questions remain over  whether or not it can sustain its growth on a diet of daily deals alone.And now it appears that there is some evidence that Groupon  is testing an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)-like commerce platform abroad, with the company  now using international markets as testing grounds for new services.  With personalization moving abroad, and it testing more robust shopping  experiences, Groupon is hoping that its aggressive spending on its  global business (and transactional advertising) will be a valuable investment in the long-term.And perhaps a VIP service, too.Original post"
378741,25062,2012-02-21T04:00:04-05:00,,"Summary: In the fragmented space of local deals, buyers converged upon Groupon, forming a perfect storm of scale. Market dynamics and technology will invert the future equation, with a convergence of competitors and a fragmentation of buyers.14 years ago Henry Blodget established his contrarian legacy by being among the first to recognize Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) enduring value. Now, Blodget is making another contrarian call in favor of the long-term profitability of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Blodget consistently says of Groupon: ""its scale gives it a big barrier to entry"". Could Groupon be too scaled to fail?At this moment, Groupon establishes scale relative to one competitor: Living Social. But we don't care much about this moment. We value Groupon based on its expected future earnings. So if the bull case for Groupon is scale, we need to look at Groupon's expected future scale.Before I explain why you should doubt Groupon's future scale, let me address another defense of Groupon's optimistic valuation: the possibility that Groupon could horizontally diversify out of its niche and into a wider range of revenue.Let's start by asking ourselves what Groupon's niche is, and what it isn't. Groupon's niche is coupons for local businesses. Groupon's niche is not group coupons.Of course, Groupon did something clever by organizing group bids. But this cleverness is not enough to reify group bids as a niche in and of itself. The US Dollar already fills the basic market need for a liquid expression of group bids. If anything, group bids meet a human psychological need for closure, but this is a psychological need, not a market one. Psychological needs are met by brands; market needs are met in niches.So let's assume we're clear that Groupon's niche is local business, not group coupons. Groupon can try to diversify horizontally, but it will have to do so by leaving its niche. Priceline (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) shouldn't panic about Groupon's expansion into travel deals. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY) will survive Groupon's move into retail. There is a reason bullish Blodget emphasizes Groupon's niche, and not its outward expansion: Groupon simply isn't competitive outside its niche. Priceline's brand communicates reliability and expediency in discount airline tickets; Groupon's doesn't. TripAdvisor results show up in search results when I look for information on local parks; Groupon's results don't. If I want to score a deal on a book, toy, or fashion accessory, I'll pick it up at Walmart, not Groupon. Groupon is successfully emulating Ebay, but only within the niche of local businesses. This is the definitive present tense, and Groupon has done little to signal a markedly better future.Thus Groupon's opportunity exists soley in local deals. Here is why you should doubt Groupon's scale even within its own niche:Amazon is a retailer with a track record of squeezing smaller and larger companies out of business. Amazon Local is currently partnered with Living Social, Groupon's #1 competitor, but the partnership is just a place-marker for Amazon's more decisive move into the space. Did you think Kindle was just for watching movies? Imagine searching for weight loss books on your Kindle Fire 2, and getting offered a discount for 24 Hour Fitness. You won't have time to read the Groupon emails in your spam folder offering you 35% off a pilates bootcamp, because you'll be on your way to the gym.Do you really think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) are going to permanently give up on deal localization? Facebook and Yelp are ongoing case studies in social-done-immaculately. Facebook's fundamental business model is connecting people with businesses; to the extent these businesses are local, Facebook will be a direct Groupon competitor. Yelp's fundamental business is connecting people with local businesses; Yelp is a direct Groupon competitor, and Yelp is more likely to realize Amazon-level success, because unlike Groupon Yelp and Amazon offer extensive consumer reviews, with a frictionless shopping interface.Groupon the pigeon has swooped in early to the local picnic. It has a few insect competitors. But now the fat cats, like Visa (NYSE:V), are trotting out from the bushes. Amazon is slithering in the grass. Facebook and Google have swung from the branches and are chattering within knuckle-walking distance. Groupon's scale meant something to the insects, but it won't mean anything to the reptiles and the mammals.The single most definitive convergence of big businesses displacing Groupon will happen in mobile apps. Mobilization complements localization. And Groupon knows this. But as better-established companies converge on local and punish Groupon for not being big enough, Groupon will also suffer fragmentation for being too big and spread out.Internet literacy will transition from visual (reading) to auditory (speaking) via voice recognition infrastructure advanced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN). Many people are reading-impaired. The less reading, and more talking, they need to do to communicate with an interface, the more they can accomplish with technology.As a result of voice recognition, increased Internet competence among illiterates will undermine the role of simplifiers. A main value provided by Groupon is that of a simplifier. But with simplicity integrated throughout the auditory web, simplifiers will be made redundant. An Internet that takes verbal instructions will simplify interactions for both consumers and local businesses. More local transactions will be able to slip through the Internet without touching Groupon's interface.The slow, steady move of big companies into localization will squeeze Groupon's margins: Groupon is too small. The auditory Internet will fragment Groupon's simplifier position: Groupon is too big. Groupon is not too scaled to fail. Don't bet against Tilson on this one. Bet against Henry Blodget's lonely understanding of scale. Just don't bet against Blodget himself; even Blodget thinks Groupon is overpriced.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
430801,25158,2012-03-13T13:32:55-04:00,,"On February 9th, the day after Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) released its first ever public quarterly report, I wrote an article founded on glaring warning signs that the stock was the perfect setup for an immediate short. The stock opened up for trading that day at $21.83, and closed yesterday at $16.74 - a more than 23% decline in 22 trading days. To take advantage of this likely swan dive, I recommended purchasing puts as opposed to outright shorting the stock. Whether you purchased an in the money, at the money, or out of the money put option, you made out with superb results. The following is a case study of the performance of March puts that were purchased on that day.After the close of trading February 8, 2012, Groupon reported that it yet again failed to register its first profitable quarter in an unexpected earnings miss. More importantly, Groupon decided to be a bit more secretive regarding key operating metrics. The first and most troublesome is Groupon's number of subscribers. Groupon has disclosed the number of subscribers in every quarter since its inception in its SEC filings, but failed to do it in its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. I pointed out in the previously linked article that the most likely reason was because subscriber growth was anemic. Secondly, Groupon also hid how many of those subscribers, old and new alike, actually purchased groupons. Unlike the first metric, Groupon has never disclosed this key measurable and failed to do so yet again. The earnings miss and glaring lack of transparency was all that was needed to suggest shorting the stock immediately via the purchase of puts. As illustrated below, if you bought an in the money put ($23), an at the money put ($22), or an out of the money put ($21), with March expiration, you had returns of 63%, 78%, and 105% respectively as of the close of trade on Monday.GRPN March $23 Put: 2/9 - $3.75; 3/12 - $6.10 (63%)GRPN March $22 Put: 2/9 - $2.75; 3/12 - $4.90 (78%)GRPN March $21 Put: 2/9 - $2.00; 3/12 - $4.09 (105%)Purchasing puts, while risky, are a viable way of generating substantial returns on stocks that are a conviction sell. While there are alternatives to this method depending on your risk tolerance, this case study shows the return may definitely be worth risking the premium paid. This article is by no means intended to bash the recent rash of dot com IPOs. Notably, Global X has significantly scaled down its GRPN position in its Social Media Index ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL). On November 22nd, that ETF which includes fellow IPO darlings - RenRen (NYSE:RENN), LinkedIn (LNKD), Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), and Pandora (NYSE:P), had Groupon as part of its top ten holdings with a 5.1% weighting. SOCL has since sold more than 50% of its Groupon position to 2.41%. Needless to say, Groupon has been a laggard in that ETF and has underperformed it since its earnings. As I previously highlighted in numerous articles, Groupon is a growth stock that simply isn't growing anymore. From issues surrounding its business model to merchant retention, accounting issues, and omissions of critical data, this is the perfect example of a stock to short or simply avoid altogether.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
363171,21950,2012-02-13T20:50:19-05:00,,"When Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) filed its IPO papers with the SEC on February 1, the news lit a rocket under almost all things internet. Stocks across the industry got revalued just because Facebook could be worth $75-100B. Even Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) jumped 5.3% on Feb 1 on its way to a 6-day jump off its $20 IPO price and into its first earnings announcement as a public company. Never mind that Facebook could eventually become a fierce competitor to Groupon.The disappointment set in after Groupon reported a loss on February 8. Excluding some international tax items, GRPN could have reported a small profit. Nevertheless, the loss helped remind investors and traders that Groupon's massive revenue creation through its steals and deals does not easily translate into profits.After earnings, I claimed that was the time to buy puts in GRPN: the pre-earnings premium on implied volatility had mostly melted away (see twitter feed). The market had managed to price the options near perfectly as the puts near-the-money (around the $22 strike) expiring February 18th remained flat despite GRPN's 14% loss on the day. Today's follow-through (Feb 13th) with a 7.5% drop occurred despite another general market rally. GRPN has now officially wiped away all the gains it made on Facebook's coattails. This may be the last time Groupon ever benefits from Facebook.In the meantime, put options on GRPN have soared. For example, the Feb $22 puts expiring this Friday have roughly doubled from Thurday's close. While I expect the stock to once again linger around its $20 IPO price for a while, in short order, I also expect the all-time lows of $15 to get tested and eventually broken.Source: FreeStockCharts.comBe careful out there!Disclosure: I am short GRPN through puts."
368311,22762,2012-02-15T12:21:32-05:00,,"By Ingrid LundenWhen Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) was gearing up for its IPO last year, there was a lot of talk about whether the company would be able to sustain its business on a diet that mainly consisted of daily deals. Today, a little sign of what Groupon might be cooking up for its next course.Over in Germany, Groupon has launched a new site, Groupon Deals, an Amazon-like storefront that sells a range of goods, from boots to bodysuits.Like Groupon’s mainstay-daily deals, the products are being sold at big discounts, of up to 70 percent on some items. Unlike the daily deals, these products do not have timeouts on buying them.According to the site, Groupon Deals offers consumers a “complete shopping experience,” although at the moment, the selection of goods on offer is pretty small. That points to this being a local experiment more than anything else for now.But even so, it is already starting to market the service in some form: A reader tells us that offers from Groupon Deals started appearing in his Facebook feed earlier today.It is unclear at this point whether this is something that Groupon is planning on offering only in Germany, or whether it intends to roll out similar storefronts in other regions, which currently serve 33 million active users.We have contacted Groupon to ask questions and will update this post as we learn more.Extending out its services to a more conventional model of selling goods online is not exactly disruptive and cutting-edge, but it is probably also a natural move for Groupon: the company already has extensive relationships with retailers and brands for its time-based daily deals, which cover not only events and services, but a range of physical products, too. Each product on the site comes with a list of “supplier details”: that might mean Groupon has a platform for third parties to upload products for sale.It also puts Groupon even more directly in competition with the likes of more established players like Amazon and eBay, to mention nothing of more local online retailing operations.International is a division where Groupon is focusing hard, but at a price. In the company’s Q4 earnings reported last week, Groupon reported a loss of $350 million, with $137 million of that attributable to international expansion costs.Groupon’s European operation was kick-started back in May 2010, when it bought Germany-based competitor Citydeal for an undisclosed sum. At that time Citydeal was already active in several European markets.Original post"
359531,24710,2012-02-12T03:37:21-05:00,,"Yesterday I published the following article on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN): ""Groupon Rights The Ship: Take Profits In Short Positions."" After reading one of the comments on my article it occurred to me that some very important qualifications were necessary regarding my contention that things were taking a turn for the better at Groupon.In the above-mentioned article, I noted that Groupon suddenly had enough cash and cash equivalents to cover the balance it owes its participating merchants. While I assumed most people would realize that the lion's share of this cash came from the initial public offering, I now believe it is necessary to make the point explicitly clear to avoid painting an overly optimistic picture regarding Groupon's finances.Although cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2011 were twice as much as accounts/merchants payable, most of that cash ($867 million out of $1.12 billion, so 80%) came from ""financing activities""--in other words, the company's IPO. Cash from operating activities was $290 million, less than half of the $557 million Groupon would need to pay-off participating merchants. While this certainly tells investors that the company's business model is technically not working, the cash from the IPO is still cash, and regardless of where it came from, the company now has enough money to pay its accounts and merchants payable more than twice over. With marketing costs as a percentage of revenue declining substantially, the cash influx from the IPO may buy the company enough time to make the business model into something sustainable.More worrisome is the fact that, according to CFO magazine, the company uses an 'aggregate free cash flow' statement which can make it difficult to discern exactly where the cash is coming from. It appears the company may be increasing its operating cash flow by stretching-out or otherwise putting-off payments to merchants and concealing this by lumping together accounts payable and merchants payable in the liabilities column of its balance sheet. If the company is indeed doing this, it could be juicing its cash flows in the short term by kicking the can down the road regarding the balances it owes merchants. This would support my original contention that the company essentially operates like a ponzi scheme.Ultimately, I stand by my contention that traders should close out their short positions for the near-term, given that impressive revenue growth and an influx of cash are likely to make Groupon appear more attractive in the short term which in turn, will likely give the stock a boost over the next few quarters. The stock could get an extra boost if the international tax expenses which caused last quarter's loss disappear and help the company swing to a profit in the coming quarters. Over the long-haul, the company's prospects are much less bright--investors should adjust their strategies accordinglyDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
358451,24710,2012-02-10T14:55:50-05:00,,"A few months back, I published a scathing criticism of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Among the factors I cited in suggesting that investors steer clear of the shares were the high cost Groupon pays to recruit new subscribers, the low percentage (25%) of Groupon's subscribers who actually purchase a coupon, and the fact that the company's merchant-payment schedule was not competitive with comparable offerings from competitors Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Offers and LivingSocial, an issue which was already causing some participating merchants to defect. On Wednesday, Groupon reported a small loss for the fourth quarter causing its shares to fall 14% the following day--the stock now trades around $20, a decline of nearly 30% from its IPO price.What was surprising about the report, and by extension, about the sell off in Groupon's shares, is that overall, the results were positive. Revenue came in at $506.475 million, far ahead of analysts' expectations of $473 million, and up 194% from the same period in 2010. The revenue figure was up 18% from the third quarter, indicating that sequential revenue growth is accelerating--revenue grew only 10% from the second to the third quarter. The quarterly loss was apparently attributable to tax expenses related to the company's international operations, excepting that, ""the company's operating profit was $15 million for the quarter,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.Notably, the company's marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue fell to 30% during the fourth quarter, down 25% from the first nine months of the year, and down 70% from the fourth quarter of 2010. This allays investor concerns over the astronomical cost the company was paying to acquire new subscribers and recruit new merchants. While this is a step in the right direction, The Wall Street Journal notes that the company still has a ways to go before its marketing expenses fall to a more sustainable percentage of revenue such as the 5% of sales Amazon pays for marketing.When you look at the numbers then, you discover that Groupon is quickly becoming more efficient from a marketing perspective. The company spend $14 million less on marketing during the fourth quarter than it spent in the third quarter, yet generated $76 million more in revenue. In fact, marketing fell as a percentage of revenue in every quarter of 2011 according to the company.Perhaps the most notable part of Groupon's fourth quarter report however, is the fact that for the first time, Groupon's cash and cash equivalents exceed its accounts payable and merchants payable. This is absolutely critical as it may signal that the business is no longer operating in a fashion that closely resembles a ponzi scheme. In my previous article on Groupon, I noted that if all of Groupon's participating merchants suddenly came-calling wanting their portion of the coupons sold, Groupon could not cover the balance. In other words, Groupon was literally spending money that didn't belong to the company. Now it appears, Groupon could not only pay its merchants the money they are owed, but could do so twice-over. As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.12 billion while accounts payable and merchants payable totaled only $557.2 million. This is a small miracle considering the company owed more than twice as much in the form of accounts payable than it had in cash and cash equivalents just three months prior. If you have short positions in Groupon, I suggest taking profits after this week's slide. Same thing goes for put options on the stock. Incredibly, it appears Groupon may be righting the ship.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
353281,25881,2012-02-09T05:40:12-05:00,,"Today Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is offering one of their best deals yet! They are offering the general public the ability to sell little pieces of their company for over $24 per share. The case with Groupon is not if, but when, their stock will start plummeting downwards. The following article will outline exactly why stocks in Groupon will never be a sound investment.Groupon is ExpandingGroupon has been expanding aggressively through purchasing startup companies which should be a cause for concern to shareholders. Purchasing companies like Adku, Mertado, and Campfire labs all within the last eight weeks will not be the necessary steps to bring Groupon to profitability. Groupon should be focusing on their core business structure and start making money before they take after the well established tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in acquiring start-ups. Furthermore they're moving their own coupons into industries where they're in way over their head. The discounted travel industry has been around for years and is saturated with companies like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Priceline (PCLN), Red Tag, Hotwire, Flight Centre etc. This is a dangerous world for the likes of Groupon to be entering while they're trying to stop the bleeding. The tech world is littered with companies which looked to expand outside of their core competencies too early in their life cycle. Groupon will soon be among these fallen techs.Groupon is currently losing money. Lots of money.But that's not a problem right? Many tech companies lose money in their early years before striking it rich. While that may be true, the companies which have come out of the difficult years of heavy losses are doing so through high R&D expenses while developing a new product. Groupon has no tangible products. Groupon has no intentions of creating a tangible product. They provide a service, not to mention that it's one of the oldest services known to the consumer world.Zero Barriers to EntryGroupon is the most well known online coupon company today. Groupon may forever be the most well known online coupon company and they will still be on the path to failure. Every campus in North America is starting to get ""Groupon"" type companies giving students the best deals. Every city in North America is starting to get ""Groupon"" companies giving them the best deals for bars and restaurants. Soon they will have to compete with every local niche coupon company. How will they fare against a golfing coupon company which is heavily networked with all the local golf courses? Or a bar and restaurant company which is friends with all the different bar owners in a city? The increase in competition is only going to drive the marketing expenses to higher levels. These marketing expenses are currently around 90% of their revenues. If they cut these marketing expenses, the competition will take over and they'll see a diminished brand recognition. If they keep these marketing expenses the competition will undercut their service fee (they currently take roughly %50 of the Groupon). It's a lose-lose scenario.Brand RecognitionThey currently have great brand recognition. Unfortunately for them they are now up against other brands in their industry with the likes of WagJag and DealFind looking to increase their market share. Anyone who is truly interested in getting the best deals will have all of these companies emailing them daily. In fact there are now services which consolidate all these companies into one singular email.Lack of Repeat BusinessCompanies use Groupon in order to attract repeat business, and often operate at a loss through the coupons. They're now starting to realize that repeat business is rarely the case. Having your product or service on Groupon creates a sense of ""cheapness."" Would you rather get a $100 massage from the parlor which has been offered on Groupon for $40 or the one which has not? Personally, once the coupon is over and they're the same price, I'm going straight to the upscale parlor that did not appear on Groupon. This applies to all services. Just consult the old proverb of the barber who put up a sign which read ""We fix $5 haircuts."" Devaluing the price of your service, even if only for a short time, will resonate with your customers that you're not worth what the other service providers are.Accounting IssuesThis is something one could expect with a new tech company which has grown rapidly since inception. But not one with a market cap of 15.43B. Groupon got themselves in trouble with the SEC for misleading investors. As a result, they had to restate their financial results for the last three years to show more accurately their true revenue. Prior to this correction they were reporting all revenue which came through the company, including the share which belongs to their merchant partners, as their own revenue.Inflated Subscriber BaseTo become a groupon subscriber you need to type an address into their website. Any address. I do not own the email address grouponwillfail@hotmail.com, but after my latest visit to the website, it is a subscriber to their growing base.ConclusionGroupon has risen 22% over the last week as a result of all the hype around Facebook. Their current Price to Book ratio is 11, while their EPS is -$1.08 as they have yet to turn a profit. They are riding the Facebook wave right now and it has presented a great short opportunity on the market. Beware, as you will be entering a popular position. They will be one of the most shorted stocks on the market as people start to see the complete lack of reasoning behind their most recent rally. This could lead to a short squeeze once they get low enough. But anything close to the price they're currently at and you can sit back and enjoy the best deal they've given you yet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN over the next 72 hours."
352711,24714,2012-02-09T02:36:31-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), who was expected to post their first quarterly profit, failed to get into the black as the ""fastest growing company ever"" reporting a non-GAAP loss per share of 2 cents and a net loss per share attributed to common shareholders of 8 cents. Revenue, however, beat estimates as the company reported over $1.6 billion in revenue in 2011. The announcement made Groupon's shares drop by over 15 percent at some points in after hours trading and disappointed investors. In this article, I express my concerns with Groupon's earnings report along with some investment advice going into the future.Groupon's stock price, unfortunately, is in almost no way controlled by the free market economy that we're all so proud of. A huge chunk of Groupon's stock is owned by a small group of shareholders and still has a very small float as only about 5 percent of outstanding shares were floated in its IPO. Small floats can substantially distort value. For example, if I started my own company and sold 0.01 percent of it to my parents or a close friend for $100, I would technically be a millionaire. This is an extreme picture of what Groupon did, but it should give you a better idea of how the company's stock price doesn't necessarily reflect its true value.Relatively small selloffs and buy ups of the stock can affect share price substantially. In early trading on February 7th, a high volume selloff of Groupon (along with some other tech darlings) brought shares down over 5 percent in a matter of minutes and then shares rebounded quickly. Before the close of trading on February 8th, right before its earnings announcement, there was a flash buy-up of shares that raised the stock price by 5 percent in a matter of minutes. Flash crashes and spikes happen frequently in stock trading, but very rarely does this abnormal trading activity happen 2 to 3 times per week.Groupon's revenue beat, in my opinion, actually hurt the company since much of their value proposition is based on its operating leverage. A relatively small increase in revenue growth is supposed to trigger a huge increase in earnings per share. Groupon's expected earnings are essentially an application of a model that predicts what the company's earnings will be based on its revenue, which is the more predictable metric. The fact that Groupon beat revenue but still missed badly in earnings suggests that the implied model was wrong and earnings won't jump as quickly as expected. This can substantially hurt the stock price going forward, especially if Groupon misses revenue estimates in the near future.Here are my current suggestions for how to trade off of Groupon's earnings announcement:1. Go long volatility on Groupon. Despite being overvalued, the stock will probably trade anywhere between $15 and $25 over the next few days. Going long options can put you in this position. If you're a conservative investor, I suggest avoiding GRPN until at least the next earnings announcement.2. Go long Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and/or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both companies have a high stake in the daily deals business. Google has Google Offers and Amazon owns a big piece of Living Social. I believe Groupon's revenue beat suggest that daily deals is beating expectations of becoming an acceptable way for consumers to buy. I know both companies are huge and their daily deals businesses are only a very small piece of the pie, but Google and Amazon know how to generate long term earnings and take over new industries that they enter. I personally prefer Google because its shares trade at a much lower multiple, but both stocks should grow in the coming months.Groupon is still a young company and nobody can guarantee whether or not it will grow to meet investors' long term expectations. However, its failure to post its first profitable quarter will turn away a lot of investors and Groupon's trading activity right now is based more on group think than data. By trading Groupon with caution and keeping an eye on the developing daily deals industry, the smart money will end up making a pretty penny from dabbling in daily deals.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
353221,24408,2012-02-09T05:10:18-05:00,,"In its first earnings release since became public, Groupon (GRPN) missed analyst estimates on the bottom line, but beat on the top line. Specifically, the company reported a loss of 2 cents, missing the 3 cents profits analysts expected. Revenues came at $506 million, exceeding the $475 million estimate. Obviously, markets didn't like the results, as the stock was sharply lower in after-hours trading. What should investors do?Stay away from the stock, as the company doesn't have a sustainable competitive advantage. Groupon's business model is based on three economic concepts that allow the company to enjoy an advantage over its competitors: ""economies of networking"", ""economies of scale,"" and the ""power of WOM and Buzz.""Economies of networking arise on the demand side of the market, when consumers buy a product in groups rather as individual units, the larger the number of consumers joining the group, the greater the benefit for each consumer. Economies of network in Groupon's model arise, as soon as a certain threshold is reached, in the form of discounts (coupons) to consumers who participate in the network - the larger the threshold, the larger the discount. As explained in Groupon's site: ""Each day, Groupon emails its members one unbeatable offer on something great to do in your city. We offer consumers great values by guaranteeing businesses a minimum number of customers. If a certain number of people sign up, then everyone gets the Groupon offer. If that minimum isn't reached, then no one gets it.""Economies of scale are the cost savings associated with a larger production size of certain product, the larger the production scale, the lower the per unit product cost. Manufacturing 100,000 laptops is cheaper than manufacturing 10,000 laptops. This means that economies of scale arise on the supply side of the market, on the savings from a larger production batch with the same fixed resources, and with the improved bargaining power with suppliers that eventually is passed on to consumers.Groupon's offerings create Word-of-Mouth and buzz for new products and services, helping them reach the ""tipping point-"" a very important factor for marketing new products and services. In essence, Groupon is turning consumers into ""product evangelists,"" which is nothing new. Amway and Avon (AVP) products have been exploiting this idea for many years - though in a different format, turning consumers into entrepreneurs and independent business owners, rather than product evangelists.While Groupon's model is simple, it isn't sustainable; for two reasons. First, as has been the case with other web-based companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Open Table (OPEN), and LinkedIn (LNKD), Groupon is selling other companies' products that have the upper hand in any deal negotiations. Second, they have plenty of competition from direct offerings from other web-based companies with a broad user base like Google (GOOG), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Yahoo (YHOO), Expedia (EXPE), Priceline.com (PCLN) and Travelzoo (TZOO).Compounding the problem is the product nature of Groupon deals. Most offers are in the discretionary category and services that are at the low end of the consumer list that are economically sensitive - like club memberships and cruises rather than everyday items like dental paste and laundry detergents. This means that Groupon must spend heavily on advertising to push these products and services on the top of their list, which certainly has a negative impact on the company's profitability.The bottom line: Groupon's most important source of advantage is the power of WOM and Buzz that it creates among customers for new products and services. But this advantage isn't sustainable as the company has little bargaining power with product suppliers, and no barriers of entry to protect its businesses from competition. That's why I will avoid the stock.Disclosure: I am short NFLX."
352851,25158,2012-02-09T03:31:03-05:00,,"Pardon the pun, but much like its popular ""Groupon Now"" mobile application feature, the time to short Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is now. The earnings report, or lack thereof, was abysmal to say the least. Expected by analysts to earn 3 cents a share the past quarter, Groupon sorely disappointed by losing 2 cents a share. While this company has failed to register a profit since its inception, much worse is its slowing sequential growth in revenue and active users. No profits, no growth, no buy.Earlier in December, I wrote an article entitled ""When to Short Groupon."" In that article, I highlighted several red flags that warned this stock would be in trouble. In addition, I predicted the stock's January rise in share price and told bearish investors to wait until after the fourth quarter earnings release to initiate a short position. Now that we have the results confirming our suspicions, the time to sell short is now as I illustrate why below.Below is a summary of the 4th quarter earnings report released by Groupon:1) Gross Billings - 1.25 billion2) Revenue - 506.5 million (40% of gross billings)3) Operating Expenses - 491.4 million (97% of revenue)4) Biggest Expense - Marketing (156.4 million - 31% of revenue)5) Tax - 34.8 million (including 1600% tax rate for international revenues)6) Adjusted Return - Loss of 42.7 million7) Adjusted Earnings per share: Loss of .02c vs. expected .03c profit/share8) Subscribers - 150 million (estimated as of Jan. 23rd)9) Active Users - 33 million10) Merchants - 250,000 in 47 countries11) Employees - 10,000 (7,000 internationally)12) Projected Revenue - 510-550 million vs. 501 million analyst expectationGroupon registered just a 3% profit margin ($15 million on 506.5 million of revenue) before interest, taxes, deductions and amortization. While Groupon beat analyst expectations on revenue (506.5 vs. expected 473 million), they failed expectations in earnings per share, with a surprising 42.7 million dollar loss on an adjusted basis. Groupon's failure to register its first profitable quarter in history can largely be attributed to an unexpected and unusually high tax payment of $34.8 million.In the earnings conference call, CFO Jason Child said the 1600% tax rate came as a result of profitability in overseas markets and establishing an international base in Switzerland. He stated that the tax rate would ""decline over time."" How long ""over time"" remains an unknown. Marketing expenses were through the roof, accounting for 31% of gross revenues.CEO Andrew Mason stated that the marketing expense as a percentage of revenue should decrease but it's ""going to take a little while."" How long is a ""little while"" remains an unknown. What we do know is that it won't happen anytime soon. That's because in addition to the army of salesman groupon has been hiring, Mr. Mason revealed that Groupon is about to spend a substantial amount of money on tech hires, in particular engineers.While gross billings of 1.25 billion seems impressive on a quarter over quarter basis (300% growth from same quarter 2010), sequentially, it's only a 7.8% increase from the third quarter's 1.16 billion. That is probably due to the most troubling aspect of Groupon's quarter - subscriber acquisition. Groupon failed to include in its earnings report the number of subscribers as of December 31, 2012. However, CEO Mason was quoted at the DLD conference held on January 23rd in Germany that Groupon currently had 150 million subscribers. That is a big red flag.I have included a chart of Groupon's growth in subscribers sequentially the past two years below. As you can see, Groupon has seen substantial growth quarter over quarter. Even when viewed sequentially, subscriber growth has increased notably, until now.As you can see, Groupon only added 5% to its subscriber base from the previous quarter. That is a substantial drop-off from previous quarters. Beginning in quarter one 2010, growth in subscriber base sequentially has increased 300%, 200%, 237%, 64%, 39%, 23%, to 5% in the last quarter. Of course, over time, growth will slow. That's the law of large numbers. But the latest drop is steep.Whether the reason for failing to add more subscribers is due to increasing competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), or Living Social is unknown. But if subscriber growth is going to slow that severely, the revenue per subscriber must increase. Unfortunately for Groupon, that hasn't occurred. Gross revenue per subscriber has been declining quarter over quarter and has remained static in 2011 on a sequential basis as you can see in the spreadsheet. This stagnant revenue growth, combined with increasing costs of subscriber acquisition, spells trouble for the future.Another problem is that we simply cannot quantify the return on Groupon's investments in technology and labor force. The reason is because Groupon fails to inform investors about critical metrics. I pointed out in my previous article that Groupon fails to inform us how many subscribers actually purchased a groupon in a given quarter. Groupon stated that ""as of December 31, 2011, Groupon's worldwide active customer base grew to over 33 million…"" At first glance, it seems that we have a number to work with as to who purchased groupons. However, the measurable is misleading. Groupon defines an active user as any customer who purchased a groupon in the past 12 months. Thus, the ""active user"" base could include customers who failed to purchase a groupon in the 4th quarter, 3rd quarter, and even the 2nd quarter. A subscriber that only purchased one groupon in a full fiscal year is hardly an active user by any reasonable standard.Moreover, Groupon states that the 33 million active customers ""may include individual customers with multiple registrations."" So if you have 4 different accounts, (which is not farfetched since Groupon only requires the registration of an email address to count you as a subscriber) Groupon will not only count you as 4 subscribers, but should you make a purchase in each account separately, you would also be considered as 4 active users. And you would be counted as 4 active users for the next 4 quarters. This is definitely a concern for investors.Why does Groupon feel the need to measure its user base in such a fashion? Instead of creating inflated categories, why don't they just tell us how many of the 150 million subscribers actually purchased a groupon in that given quarter? Groupon is fully capable of detailing how many subscribers, old and new, actually bought a groupon. They refuse to do so and it's likely because the number would not be a good reflection on the supposed ""growth story.""It's fair to say that investors were not pleased with the earnings figures and responses to questions at Groupon's first ever earnings call. The stock was down more than 15% in the after hours session at the time this article was written. But the bleeding is not over. Groupon traded sub $15 at one point not long ago and a retracement to those levels is not out of the question.Buying puts, as opposed to outright shorting the stock, is an ideal way to take advantage of the stock's decline. To those of you who currently own the stock and are hoping for a rebound possibly next quarter, a pretty good site to gauge Groupon's billings growth prior to earnings release is on Yipit. Yipit tracks the number of groupons sold and quantifies gross billings per month. I have included a link to an estimation of what they published for gross billings in the months of October and November of 2011. -Yipit Groupon Estimation.They estimated 300 million in gross billings for those two months and while I don't have their December calculations, it seems pretty close relatively speaking with Groupon's 506 million figure for the quarter (if you calculate a $200 million December). It also calculates estimates for Groupon rivals like Living Social.Without question, Groupon does trade at a high P/E multiple. But there are a lot of tech and social networking companies that trade at nosebleed valuations whose share price has been continually rising for quite some time. Companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) all trade at higher multiples than peers in the same sphere. The difference here is that those companies have a legitimate growth story. At the present moment, the same cannot be said of Groupon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
322351,24515,2012-01-26T13:22:10-05:00,,"My previous article promised survey results for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), an e-commerce company that connects merchants to consumers through the offering of discounted goods and services. Some analysts believe Groupon is a growth story while others believe it is overpriced and destined to never make money. My brief survey was designed to determine if Seeking Alpha viewers can determine the direction of this stock. Unfortunately, no definitive trend was found.84% of the respondents received Groupon offers. 39% of those look forward to receiving Groupon offers on a daily basis, 40% use Groupon but ""not very often"" while 20% are no longer interested (""…go into the spam filter."").Seeking Alpha viewers are undecided with their view of the direction of the stock, with 36% believing GRPN is an appropriately priced growth stock and 38% believing the stock price is in ""nosebleed"" territory (26% has no opinion).Interestingly, there were few short sellers (6%) taking the survey. 39% of the survey takers identify themselves as ""value"" investors. 41% place themselves in the ""growth"" camp while 19% see themselves as ""momentum"" buyers of stocks.The number of business users responding to the survey was not enough to provide results with appropriate statistical significance. Regardless, the percentages changed little over the past several days as more responses were tallied. Most businesses (68%) believe Groupon is effective in finding customers. 44% of the businesses made money by using Groupon while 24% lost money (I will assume the other 32% broke even). 40% of the businesses found acceptable loyalty from the Groupon customers while 28% ""never heard"" from those customers again.I had hoped to see a large percentage of the respondents either love or hate the service Groupon provides. Instead the survey takers were split with their views. So now investors like me have to use fundamental and strategic analysis to determine the short and long term direction of the stock.Summary of the Bullish Scenario:- First big mover in its space advantage- ""Get big fast"" strategy- Brand recognition- Rapidly growing with 10,000+ employees since 2008- Global presence- Will eventually determine and define a profitability strategy- Groupon deals are a ""win-win"" for the consumer and businessesSummary of the Bearish Scenario- Accounting issues that required restatement in Sept. 2011 to conform to GAAP (accounting for revenue as a net amount relating to merchant fees) show a company with huge losses- $15 billion market cap is difficult to justify by better case revenue projections- Marketing expenses are approximately 90% of revenue- Marketing expenses per new customer are greater than 90% of revenue- Only 21% of over 140 million subscribers have made a Groupon purchase since 2009- Low barriers to entry exist with increasing foreign and domestic competition- Additional completion from both start-ups and industry giants- Expected insider selling will begin in MayDisclosure: I intend to keep my short position of GRPN and will likely take a bearish position utilizing bear spreads before May 2012."

The only thing necessary for a person to start a daily deal site is a list of zip code-targeted emails and a the Yellow Pages. It requires a basic knowledge of computer programming and web development. Daily deals are easily integrated into existing platforms, i.e. credit card providers offering cash back bonuses, creating competition from almost every possible angle.I have read the argument that Groupon has a first mover advantage and a strong brand. The first mover advantage is relevant when the barrier to entry is high and the product has extrinsic value. Groupon's competitors are already numerous, and include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Number of Subscribers Is Inflated; Accounting IssuesUpon arriving on the Groupon website the visitor is immediately prompted to enter an email address. The site gives the impression it is the only way to gain access. Therefore, some of the subscribers have no intention of returning. Further, there is the problem of multiple registrations, where users create multiple accounts, in order to take advantage of the offers.On August 11, 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Groupon used accounting which would mislead investors about the company's marketing expenses. Groupon Chief Executive Andrew Mason responded:The SEC requested they be removed, and Groupon complied.Groupon was forced to change the way it accounted for revenue. From The New York Times:I question Groupon's ability to keep track of whats going on within the business. The numbers generated are haphazard, and do not allow managers or investors to understand the company's financial situation.Poor Customer RetentionCustomer retention is the most recent development in the Groupon saga. The businesses using Groupon do not like it. Issues with the service include:Consider a competitive business environment such as New York City. A person using Groupon for a service will switch from one competing shop to the next without ever repatronizing. The discount will lower the opportunity cost, resulting in an increase in out-of-area customers who also have no intention of repeating the business.The counter-argument is businesses need to learn to use the service. If the salespeople were not encouraged to ""squeeze as much as they can out of the business,"" this argument would be understandable. Groupon has failed to realize the basic marketing 101 lesson, create value. Instead Groupon is destroying the value of the brand. The strongest part of the company.Groupon is an overvalued company. It continues to erode itself from the bottom up, by doing the exact opposite of what it is supposed to do -- help small businesses make money. Groupon's business model presents some serious economic issues, and there is some crazy accounting going on. Multiple employees have come forward claiming the company is preying on small-business owners. By taking these risks into consideration, I do not believe Groupon is worth its asking price.Disclosure: I am short GRPN.Disclaimer: My analysis is meant to be a starting point for individual research.

When looking at the business from a big picture standpoint, there are three parties that must profit from Groupon. These are the subscribers, the merchants, and the company itself.SubscribersThe big advantage that Groupon has is its subscriber base. There were 30 million Groupon subscribers at the end of Q3 2011, and this number will be around 35 million in its next earnings announcement. Groupon is the number one daily deals site in terms of subscribers in 35 different countries. However, there are several risks that Groupon faces when it comes to subscribers. There are now over 500 daily deals sites worldwide and over 100 in the United States. Any one of these sites can be the next major daily deals site and Groupon could be left in the dust like Myspace was with Facebook's entrance.In addition, Groupon subscribers currently do not have a major anchor to keep subscribers for a reason other than its daily deals. Google Offers subscribers have Gmail accounts and other Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) services while credit card rewards programs provide a service other than just deals. However, the company has been chaning this by adding to its product line. This includes new offerings like Groupon Live, Groupon Getaways, and Groupon Goods. The company also risks losing subscribers if they fail to continue attracting merchants.MerchantsRecent bearish activity on Groupon stock has been from concerns over Groupon's merchant retention. The company has responded by releasing the Merchant Center, which shows merchants their ROI from using Groupon as a marketing instrument. However, it is overly simplistic. There is no way to know if Groupon customers would have used the service without the Groupon and monitoring repeat business is very difficult. In addition, earnings are a major concern. With deals being for more than 50 percent off and Groupon taking about 50 percent of deal revenue, merchants get at most 25 percent of what they would normally charge for their product or service.Despite Groupon having an obvious ROI in terms of revenue, many businesses lose money on their Groupons and can only be profitable on high repeat business. Merchants that can potentially profit with Groupon are realistically limited to companies with very high fixed costs and very low variable costs. This includes theme parks, movie theaters, museums, and video arcades. I believe the food service industry will eventually stop using Groupon or significantly reduce usage, and this could destroy Groupon's future earnings potential.Groupon's TakeGroupon takes about 50 percent of each Groupon it sells, which is a huge cut. I was in complete shock when I first heard that the company was not profitable. I believe for Groupon to stay competitive in the future, the company will not be able take such a big chunk from each Groupon sold. Groupon's cut will also have to decrease for Groupons to become profitable in the food service industry and retail industry. I believe that competitors will lower their cuts enough to simply stay in business. Subscribers will go where the merchants are and merchants will go where it is cheapest for them to promote their products and services. Long term, this can mean an end to Groupon or at least its potential profitability.ConclusionI believe that daily deals sites will be around as long as there are websites, and they will continue to be popular. However, I don't believe that Groupon can ever become the profitable behemouth like Google became from similar roots. It's important to remember that Google was not the first search engine, Windows was not the first operating system, Facebook was not the first social network, and that AOL used to be a $200 billion company. Daily Deals is very likely to be taken over by Google, Facebook, or maybe even a company that hasn't even been started yet. Groupon is still a very expensive short, and there is still potential for upward spikes in the future, since the stock has such a small float. I recommend shorting the stock or buying put options at $19.50, and those who are very bearish should consider holding a short position in GRPN before its next earnings announcement.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
353291,25911,2012-02-09T05:46:59-05:00,,"In Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) Q4 earnings announcement, they emphasize year over year changes, which are very impressive. In this article I will analyze some trends at the quarterly level, which I think is more illuminating.Let's start with revenues. On a year over year basis, growth is an incredible 195%. On a quarter over quarter basis, however, the growth is only 18%. Worse, it is decelerating. Groupon's guidance of $510-$550 million implies only 1%-9% revenue growth in Q1. The revenue per active subscriber, which Groupon did not state but is easy enough to calculate, fell by 2% from Q3 to Q4. The falling growth is also consistent with Groupon's strategy of reducing marketing expenses. If we extrapolate the trends of decelerating growth we find that Groupon's revenues may peak as early as Q3 or Q4 this year (this is illustrated in graph below - ). Now let's discuss costs. Cost of revenue shows a slightly growing trend on a percent basis; presumably it is taking more effort to sell the groupons. To their credit, Groupon has significantly cut down on marketing expense in the last quarter, and we extrapolate significant further cuts, although at a diminishing rate. SG&A has been rather flat on a percent basis, and we assume it will stay flat. A table of Groupon's revenues, costs and operating profit is shown below. Up through Q4 2011 we use real data. For Q1 2012 we can calibrate to make our forecast fit in the center of Groupon's revenue and operating profit guidance. For Q2 and beyond there is only extrapolation.I acknowledge that there are many assumptions, uncertainties and simplifications in this analysis. The most critical assumption is that Groupon's revenues will continue their decelerating trend, and ultimately stop to grow completely towards the end of the year. Curious investors can easily enough plug in their own projections and see what that suggests about Groupon's value. Personally I think it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Groupon's shares are significantly overvalued at present. Also, if Groupon's management expects the decelerating trend to break in Q2 or beyond, then why not announce this? They provided no guidance for the full year of 2012.Some people have claimed that Groupon is a complete ""fraud"" or ""Ponzi."" That is taking things too far. In a short amount of time, Groupon's management has built a business worth billions of dollars. That's impressive. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be content with the real value they have created. Soon their trading lock-up will expire, and they hope to sell their shares to the investing public at very inflated prices. Don't accommodate them.Disclosure: I am short GRPN."
351841,25047,2012-02-08T17:22:31-05:00,,"As Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) reports yet another loss, several things become evident.One of them is that the business Groupon is developing, in the local deals space, does not scale easily. For increased activity, the sector requires increased resources, in the form of an army of salesmen that need to contact and get the local deals with local merchants. With more than 10,000 employees already for yearly revenue of $1.6 billion, it shows how distant the model is from Facebook (2011 revenue $3.7 billion with 3,200 employees) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (2011 revenue $37.9 billion with 32,400 employees).Still, also evident is that Groupon will turn profitable. It's already showing free cash flow, and within one or two quarters it should start showing profits, which is not the same as saying that it will be worth the market capitalization it trades at (around $14.9 billion).The Main ProblemThe main problem remains what we observed: The business is not lending itself to be levered - it's requiring too much manpower. For the business to be truly stellar, it would have to evolve into the kind of business Google's AdSense is, where the local businesses themselves would set up the campaigns with little human intervention from Groupon's salesmen.It's no wonder why the daily deals sector has already been abandoned by some large competitors, such as Facebook and Yelp. We also got to know, through Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s 10-K, that LivingSocial produced a $0.5 billion loss in 2011. Amazon.com still carries a 31% interest on LivingSocial, so almost a third of that loss really is Amazon's to bear. One wonders for how much longer such losses can be allowed.Another large competitor dipping its toe into the industry is Google with Google Offers. However, recently Google seems to also have changed the focus from trying to build out the segment all by itself, to also carrying other competitor's deals.ConclusionGroupon will soon turn profitable, but its earnings release shows the daily deals sector does not scale well, and even when profitable it will never be the kind of pure high-margin Internet business that other companies, such as Facebook and Google, epitomize. Thus, it's hard to see how Groupon can warrant the huge valuation put on it by the market, especially taking into account that revenue growth is now expected to slow dramatically while profitability, though it will make an appearance, won't be extraordinary.Disclosure: I am short AMZN."

I certainly do!The way to find out the direction of any stock with non-diversified products or services is to know what its customers and potential customers are thinking and matching those thoughts to the assumptions used to value the current stock price. That information is now easy to obtain through electronic surveys like the one found here.  My goal is to have Seeking Alpha readers (and people you know) take a brief survey about Groupon, and then I will publish the results in another article within a week. The survey results should tell us if the bulls or bears are right, and give us significant information about the direction of the stock price.This survey is obviously not endorsed by Groupon or Seeking Alpha, but it is a way to test my thesis that the consumers and/or businesses that use the product of  “one-trick pony companies” are the best people to determine the future stock price of those companies. A survey of customers and businesses could be profitable if it shows that the assumptions made from leading analysts are right or wrong.The timing of my poll is perfect for a GRPN, a growth stock that has no earnings and sports a $12 billion market cap. Believers are buying into the prospect of continuing growth coming from an innovative company. Shorts see increased competition, weakening customer loyalty, high marketing costs leading to weak margins, and the likelihood that profits will never come to fruition. Who is correct?The answer lies with customers and businesses who have tried Groupon. Do these customers find the discounted deals worthy of purchasing on a regular basis? Or do they now place Groupon emails in the spam filter? Are businesses making money from  continued business after advertising on Groupon, or are they likely to find other ways to market their goods and services? A survey of customers is the only way to know before financials are released.Seeking Alpha readers are a suitable group to answer my survey for several reasons. We are all investors looking for an edge, and getting the answers to a survey ahead of professional investors is appealing.  All of us use the Internet with many of us experiencing the Groupon offers. Those of us who have purchase a “deal” already know how much more we intend to use the services of Groupon, and those of us with businesses that have used Groupon -- or know of business who have used Groupon -- are aware of its benefits or lack thereof.I commit to publish the results of the survey in a separate article in one week or sooner if there are enough respondents to make the results statistically significant.I shall not do further trading in the stock until the initial results are published.For the record, I have a small short position in GRPN based upon the negative write-up published in forensic accountant Tracey Coenen’s blog. I’ll gladly go long or short more GRPN in a heartbeat if the survey results indicate bullish or bearish earnings lie ahead.Have fun taking the survey. It should take less than a minute to answer the questions. Here is the link again: GRPN Survey.Disclosure: I am short GRPN."
317246,25158,2012-01-03T18:34:00-05:00,,"Much has been said about the viability of Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) business model. Commentators across the board have accurately identified significant obstacles to Groupon’s continued growth and aspirations of becoming a profitable enterprise. From low barriers to competition to questionable accounting tactics, Groupon certainly has its fair share of naysayers. However, the biggest threat to Groupon’s future may be its own source of income – the merchant.In a nutshell, Groupon’s business model focuses on monetizing the personal information of potential consumers across a broad spectrum of markets. It utilizes the email addresses of its subscribers as a communicative channel to advertise the discounted deals of local merchants (it also uses a mobile application as part of its marketing strategy). It is this direct and personalized communication to the masses that attracts Groupon to merchants. Merchants, in particular small businesses who have just started their operation or seek to broaden their customer base, see Groupon as a viable alternative to traditional advertising despite the hefty cost that comes along with it (merchants often split the gross revenues with Groupon).Simply put, merchants are the lifeblood of Groupon’s business model. They produce the product that Groupon markets. Acquiring more merchants diversifies the list of products they can market, which allows them to attract more paying subscribers and increase revenues. As a result, the rate at which Groupon adds new featured merchants can be quite the barometer for future subscriber and revenue growth. However, what is more important than the acquisition of featured merchants is the retention thereof. Groupon boasts of increasing the number of merchants featured in its marketplace from 212 in the second quarter of 2009 to 78,466 in the second quarter of 2011. However, this acquisition growth will undoubtedly slow, as there can only be a finite number of merchants willing to use the service. Consequently, the majority of revenues must come from repeat merchants.In its S-1 filing, Groupon acknowledged that merchant retention was integral to revenue growth and achieving profitability:What is Groupon’s plan to ensure merchant retention? In the same filing, Groupon stated:Is there strategy effective? Unfortunately, Groupon doesn’t say. In a previous article, I identified a key measurable that Groupon fails to inform its shareholders. Groupon reports how many groupons are purchased in a given period but fails to disclose how many subscribers are actually purchasing them. Along the same vein, Groupon informs us how many merchants were featured in a given period, but they refuse to inform us how many of them were repeat merchants (those who use Groupon more than once). In a letter to CEO Andrew Mason dated June 29, 2011, the SEC made it a point to highlight this omission in Groupon’s S-1 filing and requested it disclose this key information to shareholders. Groupon failed to do so in its amended September S-1 filing, which can only raise negative implications as the following case study may illustrate.On September 10, 2011, Groupon published its deal of the day for a Houston seafood restaurant called Ragin Cajun. The well-known local restaurant gave customers $40 worth of its tasty cuisine for just $20. The deal ended quickly and successfully, with over 5,000 groupons purchased. I was fortunate enough to get in on the receiving end of this great bargain. The following weekend, I went to the restaurant and used my groupon for $40 worth of shrimp and oyster platters. The restaurant was packed, and it seemed everyone in line had a printed groupon voucher in hand. Interestingly, before we could redeem our groupon, the cashier made each and everyone of us fill out a brief questionnaire. The slip asked for some personal information, one of which was our email address. Not long thereafter, I received an email from Ragin Cajun (see below):As you can see, Ragin Cajun essentially decided to cut Groupon out of the equation. Essentially, the restaurant asked itself this question: What does Groupon do that warrants a 50/50 split in proceeds? The answer: they have the email addresses of people who might be interested in our kind of food -- and nothing more. Instead of using Groupon again and splitting the proceeds down the middle, Ragin Cajun just decided to duplicate Groupon’s service. It took the email addresses of all those who redeemed the groupon and sent a mass email to those customers offering another discount (now only 25%), only this time, they stand to pocket all the money. I have yet to see another Ragin Cajun groupon offering, and I highly doubt I will see one again.What the Ragin Cajun example proves is the unlikelihood of merchants using Groupon more than once. Many businesses may not view the Groupon service as a long-term strategy to increasing profitability. Rather, they view it as a potent promotional tool to get customers they once could not access in the door. Once that is accomplished, they will cut ties with Groupon and use their own resources at a notably lesser expense to market their product. This is especially the case when it comes to the merchants in the food and beverage industry where the deals just aren’t economically feasible. The mark-up in your traditional dine-in local restaurant is 300%, give or take. Taking this figure, Ragin Cajun’s break-even price point for its deal of the day was about $13.33. Because the restaurant only received $10 per voucher (the other $10 went to Groupon), it took a $3.33 loss per voucher redeemed. Clearly, the restaurant took the one-time loss for purposes of expanding its customer base. For those who may be skeptical of the numbers, the proof is in the pudding. The restaurant didn’t use Groupon again, and it marketed the same kind of deal but with just a 25% (as opposed to 50%) discount on the meal the second go-around.Groupon must figure out a strategy to incentivize their merchants to repeatedly offer their products/services without affecting its profit share. It does not have the luxury of continuing to sustain losses before realizing a gain like its much bigger competitors, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Groupon's goal of becoming a profitable enterprise will lie in large part with its ability to convince its merchants that its service is more than just a marketing tool, but also a legitimate way to turn a profit.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312933,25158,2011-12-09T12:47:43-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has been up rather dramatically the past few days. It opened for trading on Tuesday at $18.80 ($1.20 less than its IPO price) to as high as $22.90 today. The near 22% return is notable even for this highly volatile stock. There have been numerous “reasons” for this explosion from short sellers taking profits after the stock’s steep decline late last month to the debut of Groupon’s new application “Groupon Scheduler.” However, the most likely catalyst was the recent news of rival Living Social’s new round of funding.According to a Bloomberg report yesterday, competitor LivingSocial recently initiated a second $400 million funding campaign in which $176 million has already been sold. Among the investors was Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which had previously invested $175 million in the initial private offering a year earlier. The most recent round of funding gives the online daily discounter a valuation of approximately $6 billion dollars, nearly double what it was worth just eight months ago. Expected 2011 revenues have been estimated from $1 billion to as much as $2 billion according to varying research firms. Since the financial information is not public, perhaps a better tool to compare LivingSocial to Groupon would be the number of subscribers. As of November 30, 2011, LivingSocial had approximately 46 million subscribers. That number pales in comparison to Groupon.As of the end of third quarter 2011, Groupon reported an estimated 143 million subscribers worldwide, more than three times that of LivingSocial. Since subscriber total is integral to the valuation of these Internet IPOs, Groupon should seemingly have a larger market capitalization. Groupon sold about 5.5% of its stock on November 4, 2011. With 637.2 million shares outstanding, its market cap is currently around $14 billion. A case can be made that if LivingSocial is receiving funding at a $6 billion valuation, Groupon’s shares should be trading much higher than current levels upwards of $28 a share for a market cap of $18 billion. The recent news of LivingSocial’s funding likely caused a scare among the shorts and triggered a short squeeze.I recently wrote an article on why investors should be bearish long term on Groupon. Groupon does not make money. It hasn’t since its founding in and won’t anytime soon. But that’s not what worries me the most. It’s lack of growth, rather its retracting growth, is what’s most troublesome. Yes, Groupon is in reality shrinking, not growing. While Groupon has had a rapid incline in its subscriber numbers, the actual number of groupons actually sold as a percentage has been on a decline year after year, quarter after quarter. Look at the chart I created below with data collected from Groupon’s S-1 filing earlier this year.As you can see, the number of groupons actually purchased declined from 69% in 2009 to 60% in 2010. Each quarter's sales this year was lesser than the same quarter the year before: Quarter one declined 17%; Quarter two declined 11%; Quarter three declined 15%. What’s even worse is that just this year, the number of groupons sold (again as a percentage) has declined sequentially quarter after quarter. From 34% in quarter one to 28% in quarter two, to 23% in quarter three! Now this wouldn't necessarily be a problem if the company was making money, but it doesn't. The losses have only gotten greater with every passing quarter. Which means only one thing: the cost of subscriber acquisition is greater than the revenues received from those new subscribers, much greater. The only logical explanation I can think of for this is that either the old subscribers aren't buying as much or the new ones aren't buying as much as the older subscribers, if at all. Either scenario doesn't bode well for neither the top nor bottom line. Groupon is quick to boast about how many subscribers they are adding, but if those subscribers don't buy, it just doesn't make dollars and sense. Most importantly, what we really need to know is how many subscribers are actually purchasing groupons. Groupon can easily disclose this information but they do not. Their failure to do so is definitely a red flag and a negative sign to say the least. Competition from companies like LivingSocial, Amazon, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the most likely culprit for Groupon's downward trend. Groupon's illusory perception of growth is the perfect kind of stock for an investor to start a short position because when the cat is let out the bag, everyone runs for the door. The only question is WHEN?It is definitely wise to wait and see what Groupon reports in its fourth quarter earnings. If the percentage of groupons sold relative to the number of subscribers has again declined and the losses have also increased substantially, then the case against Groupon is solidified. However, because of the usual rise in the broad market at the beginning of each year, colloquially termed the ""January Effect,"" an immediate short position may not be wise. The end of March to early April 2012 is probably the most ideal time to take advantage of an approaching decline in Groupon’s stock for two reasons. First, May 4, 2012 is the first opportunity for Groupon insiders to sell stock. According to the lock-up agreement that the company filed with the SEC, directors, officers, and anyone holding 5% or greater of outstanding capital stock are restricted from selling shares until after the 180 day period has expired (See page 130 of S-1 under Shares Eligible for Future Sale section). Shares of LinkedIn (LNKD) plummeted more than 15% to the lows of the year immediately after insiders capitalized on their newly found freedom to sell stock on November 18, 2011 (see chart).(Click to enlarge)Groupon insiders will no doubt follow the same trend. They are an over-valued internet IPO darling much like LinkedIn (and for that matter Pandora (NYSE:P) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z)), and their history tells us they will definitely do what’s best for their individual pockets as opposed to company expansion and re-investment. In the early days of their venture capital funding, $942 million of the $1.1 billion raised were paid to insiders (Insider Greed). In the latest round of private offerings, Groupon raised $946 million, of which $810 million were used to pay off insiders (Insider Greed 2)! Of course, insiders should reward themselves, but to the tune of 85% of the total venture capital funding??? The whole point of raising funds is to invest in the company’s expansion and growth. Groupon insiders clearly have a hit and run mentality and you shouldn't expect anything different come the beginning of May 2012.The second reason to take the bearish approach during the above mentioned time-frame is to capitalize in advance on one of the worst trading months traditionally for the stock market – May. The old adage “Sell in May and Go Away” rings true year after year as the Dow Jones, S&P, and Nasdaq have suffered notably poor performances in this particular month. Don't forget, Groupon should report its first quarter earnings sometime in April. So if the numbers go as I predict, it would create the perfect storm for a steep decline in share price. To take full advantage of these events, incrementally buying at the money or out of the money puts (no more than 5% out of the money) in end of March/April with three months expiration out should net significant gains if the stock should plummet as predicted. Shorting the stock outright has unlimited exposure, but with puts, at least losses can be capped if the tide turns the opposite direction.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In the process they acquired 20 companies to give the impression of growth and sold shares for $700 million to the public.  Did the public get a good deal?  Although Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse might disagree, we think not.Groupon was capitalized with $1.074 million equity on December 30, ’07.  In return for the invested capital, Groupon issued a stunning 321 million common shares and 1 million preference shares.  This amounts to 1/3 of a penny per share.  Three years later the lucky holders of these shares would have a value in the $13 billion range.  This amounts to a return for the first private investors of 13,000% - in 4 years.  Is this a coupon bubble – or am I missing something?  Somebody please explain this to me.Groupon has leveraged a strong roster of officers and directors who had the experience and background to engineer a stunning performance which would excite the public to buy shares in the IPO.  Eric P. Lefkofsky, an investment banker and database entrepreneur who operated a negative check database service, executed on a plan to consolidate an old industry and present a story of rapid growth.  With tremendous foresight, these financial entrepreneurs created an expanding company with a historical growth pattern and sold it to the public at a $20 billion valuation.  Did the public buy overpriced stock?Chart 1.1 indicates that Groupon is highly priced.  We compared Groupon market cap to annual sales and book value.  We did not consider P/E or P/CF as Groupon produces neither in positive quantities.  With the available measures, Groupon is priced in the high end of the ranges.  Could the price fall? By how much could it fall? And when could it fall?Rapid revenue growth – Is it sustainable?One feature of Groupon that attracted investors is growth momentum and plenty of it.  The company’s top line growth was a blistering 700% in the nine months ending Sept 30 ‘11 year over year. However, the sustainable growth rate has not performed at this level as the company has yet to earn a profit.  Clearly, even if the company controls itself into a profitable growth cycle, it will grow at a mere fraction of historical rates on a long term sustainable basis.  When investors pay up for rapid growth that is not sustainable, the share price tends to over inflate.Quick facts to consider when valuing Groupon:Average revenue per employee was $41,274 according to the prospectus and $56,705 according to a more recent employee tabulation from Google Finance.This compares to its peer group as follows:Revenue per employee is a critical measure of any new media company.  Revenue per employee of Google and Apple indicate highly productive, probably well paid and happy employees.  Groupon’s low revenue per employee may indicate less productive employees.Average revenue per Groupon sold was $12.00 - $13.00 as of Sept 30, ’11.Although this figure has grown, compare revenue per customer to some of the most successful companies and you will find a stark contrast.How investors make money from Groupon lessonsIn our view, investors should be looking to buy undervalued stocks and sell overvalued stocks.  With a highly valued stock and low operating metrics, Groupon appears overvalued and therefore positioned for a declining stock price throughout 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

311147,24821,2011-12-01T02:33:27-05:00,,"I believe Benjamin Graham put it best in his fantastic book, ""The Intelligent Investor,"" where he says that when an investor buys shares in a stock, he is owning a piece of a business, not just making a gamble. This was to give a different perspective as many investors during his time, and even today, often think of shares as nothing more than chips at the poker table, rather than rights to the current and future earnings stream of a particular company. In this case, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) seems like a great stock to analyze.Many people, including myself, have used Groupon's services, as they simply provide value. If I'm going to a restaurant, but GRPN allows me to enjoy the meal at 50% of the cost, why not use them. However, as sales have increased at GRPN, so have losses making for an unenviable business model.Looking at their prospectus filed with the SEC on November 7th, right before going public, sales growth is simply amazing, growing from a tiny $5,000 in 2008 to over $300M at the end of 2010. However, profits didn't follow, as GRPN lost just over $2M in net income in 2008, and swelled to over $450M in losses at the end of 2010, as marketing and SG&A expenses predominately skyrocketed. So I ask you, looking from the perspective of the great Mr. Graham, would you want to own a piece of this business when it lost over $450M in net income, while experiencing sales growth it most likely won't be able to match going forward? I surely do not want to own GRPN and it seems as though the initial euphoria has already worn off less than thirty days after going public.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312634,24714,2011-12-08T09:48:50-05:00,,"I wrote an article recently about how Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) stock went down over 10 percent in one day for no apparent reason. On December 7th, shares went up 9.93 percent over the trading day and were up as high as 11 percent at one point. The day's Groupon news consisted of the company releasing Groupon Scheduler and a lawsuit against Groupon for altering merchant contracts in e-mails. From an investor's standpoint, the lawsuit will have a negligible effect on stock price so that leaves us with Groupon Scheduler. Groupon's market cap increased by $1.22 billion and no matter how useful Groupon Scheduler will be, there is no way it will add that much value over time, especially when new functionality should be expected when the company has such high expected growth.Groupon's stock performance so far has been remarkably strange. Including its first trading day, there have been 4 days where Groupon shares increased by 8 percent or more and 4 days where Groupon shares dropped by 9 percent or more. This is out of only 23 days of trading. What's more surprising is that very little material news has been released about Groupon. Most of the fluctuations come from nowhere. Groupon stock's annualized standard deviation has been 108.36 percent since it began trading, not including its first day on the market. This is huge compared to the S&P 500's annualized standard deviation of 21.02 percent during this same period. To put this into perspective, Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) annualized standard deviation during this time has been 40.21 percent. What's even more surprising is that Groupon's beta is only 1.25 thus far, which is very small when looking at its volatility. This stems from the stock having such a low correlation with the market at only 0.317.From the research I've done to find an explanation for this volatility, it seems that most experts believe it is from trading activity and from fears that Groupon will lose market share. The days of big drops came once shorting Groupon became affordable. Then, it appears the stock bounced back once the shorts cashed in on their positions. Groupon is one of the most widely followed stocks on the market and has such a low float that hovers around $600 million. This allows trading activity to have an adverse affect on the stock.I still remain very bearish on Groupon. I believe this new Groupon Scheduler will have little to no effect on most subscribers, since only about 20 percent of Groupon subscribers have bought a Groupon and only about 10 percent have bought more than one. There are always stories coming out about small business owners who had a negative experience with Groupon, including a cupcake company that had to make over $100,000 cupcakes at a loss and the most current lawsuit against the company mentioned in the first paragraph. In the end, daily deals sites will have no moats. Every company with a large customer base including credit card companies, commercial banks, and social networking sites will get in on the daily deals craze and use their bargaining leverage to make prices lower. As this happens, small businesses will have to pay lower and lower premiums for their deals. This increased competition can easily bump Groupon out of the market, since many of its competitors will have core businesses to anchor themselves to while Groupon will not. As far as short term investing goes, I still believe the best way to make money on Groupon is to go long call options and long put options. This way, you will be able to have high returns when Groupon shares have strong fluctuations, which is all but guaranteed to happen in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
311157,23998,2011-12-01T04:02:43-05:00,,"Groupon shares spike on Wednesday, as risk assets rallyShares of Groupon, Inc. (GRPN) rose 9.24% on Wednesday, November 30th, to close at $17.49, as risk assets rallied in response to the coordinated central bank action to boost liquidity on Wednesday morning. In this post we'll look at the current optimal puts, post-rally, to hedge Groupon against a greater-than-35% drop over the next several months, and also the current costs of hedging a few other tech companies for comparison. Before that, we'll take a look at how a previous hedge on Groupon against a greater-than-35% decline reacted as the underlying stock fell almost exactly that much -- 35.4% -- from November 17th to November 29th. First, a reminder about optimal puts and decline thresholds.About Optimal PutsOptimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor uses an algorithm developed by a finance Ph.D. to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your position, scanning for the optimal ones.Decline ThresholdsIn this context, ""threshold"" is the maximum decline you are willing to risk. Another way of thinking about it is this: the percentage you can tolerate losing. In this case, since we're using 35% as a decline threshold, we are indicating that we could tolerate a 35% loss, but not a loss greater than that. You can enter any percentage you like for a decline threshold when scanning for optimal puts (the higher the percentage though, the greater the chance you will find optimal puts for your position). We used 35% as a decline threshold when calculating a hedge for it on November 17th because Groupon was too expensive to hedge against a significantly smaller threshold then.Hedging Groupon on November 17th In a Seeking Alpha article published the following day (""No Daily Deal: Groupon is Expensive to Hedge""), we included this screen capture, showing the optimal put option contract to buy to hedge 100 shares of GRPN against a greater-than-35% drop between then and April 20, 2012. A note about these optimal put options and their cost: to be conservative, Portfolio Armor calculated the cost based on the ask price of the optimal puts. In practice an investor can often purchase puts for a lower price, i.e., some price between the bid and the ask.Groupon closed at $24.77 on November 17th. If an investor purchased 100 shares of it at that closing price, and purchased the optimal puts above at their ask price, his total investment (underlying stock + option hedge) would have looked like this at the time:Option Hedge: 1 contract (100 puts) GRPN120421P00022000 = $550Underlying Stock: 100 shares of GRPN @ $24.77 = $2,477Total = $3,027 Groupon and that hedge on November 29th: On November 29th, Groupon closed at $16.01, down 35.4% from its closing price on November 17th. The screen capture below shows the quote for the $22 strike, April expiry put options on it on the 29th. Note that the ask price has jumped from $5.50 in the screen capture above to $9.60 in the screen capture below, and the last trade on the 29th was at $9.50. However, to be conservative, we'll work with the bid price of $9.00 below.Here's what our hypothetical investor's underlying stock + option hedge would have looked like on November 29th:Option Hedge: 1 contract (100 puts) GRPN120421P00022000 up 63.6% at the bid of $9.00 = $900Underlying Stock: 100 shares of GRPN down 35.4% @ $16.01 per share = $1601Total = $2,501Net decline of hedged position as stock drops 35.4%Remember that, on November 17th, by buying the optimal puts to hedge against a greater-than-35% decline, our hypothetical investor was indicating that he was willing to tolerate a 35% decline-- but not a larger one. Let's say he decided to sell both his shares and his hedge on November 29th, after the stock had declined 35.4% from November 17th. What loss would he have incurred? The difference in value between his combined positions on November 17th and November 29th was ($3,027 - $2,501) = $526, which represents a 17.4% decline. So, in this case, the hedge he bought to protect himself against a greater-than-35% decline would have actually protected him against a greater than 17% decline.The optimal puts to hedge Groupon nowBelow is a screen capture showing the optimal put option contract to hedge 100 shares of GRPN against a greater-than-35% decline as of Wednesday's close. Note that this is a different options contract, with a lower strike price than the one in the screen capture above, as this is a hedge against a 35% drop from a lower share price.Hedging costs as of Wednesday's close  The table below shows the costs of hedging several other leading tech stocks against greater-than-35% declines over the next several months, as of Thursday's close.*Based on optimal puts expiring in April, 2012**Based on optimal puts expiring in May, 2012***Based on optimal puts expiring in June, 2012Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
310905,24607,2011-11-30T07:44:01-05:00,,"Groupon (GRPN), the online group deal site, recently began trading on the NYSE, Friday November 4, amidst much hype and anticipation. Its shares originally priced at $20, shot up 40% to $28 at the start of the trading day. Today, it trades at 25% below its IPO. So, is now the time to buy, or is the hot air still leaking out of this .com bubble?We do think it is the latter, as Groupon’s fundamentals do not look terribly promising for two reasons:1. Groupon Is OvervaluedInvestors should be extremely skeptical of the price of a stock that lost close to $420 million last year and $117 million in Q1 2011. The 40% up shot of the stock price upon its opening is unfounded and based on hype surrounding Groupon and recent internet IPOs of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pandora (P), and older IPOs like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google (GOOG). Groupon’s pre-market valuation of $13 billion is 30-times higher that of Amazon.com back in 1997 ($430 million), and more than half that of Google's in 2004 ($23 billion).2. Groupon Is A FadGroupon is a glorified coupon company that features online group deals from a variety of different companies. But, ultimately, Groupon is just a middleman connecting potential customers to businesses. This leaves Groupon open to threats on both the costumer and business side of its operation. Many of the bargain hunters using Groupon are doing it out of hype. Groupon is the first to pioneer the online group discount. But, what happens when Groupon is no longer “in”. People will grow bored of the group discount fad and move onto the next thing, and Groupon will go the way of MySpace.The business side of Groupon’s operation is perhaps the bigger threat. In addition to the steep discounts these businesses have to give Groupon bargain hunters, Groupon takes another chunk out of the pie. Merchants are making little to no money off these deals, so Groupon becomes more of a form of advertisement than a source of profits. In this case, what is to prevent businesses from cutting out the middleman and putting out their own deals?Bottom LineGroupon doesn’t have a sustainable business model. Its stock valuation is all hype with no fundamental basis for its stock price. Despite the 25% drop in price below its IPO, I’m still avoiding the stock. I wouldn’t want to own Groupon when the fad completely dissolves.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
310193,24432,2011-11-25T09:23:49-05:00,,"Back on November 16, I posted a few charts showing the high value of at-the-money Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) put options compared to the calls. As I pointed out, if you can sell an ATM put, buy the same strike call, and simultaneously short the stock and collect a premium, that’s the equivalent of a guaranteed return.Only one problem. The stock is expensive to borrow. But that’s changing. Those hard-to-borrow fees are getting a lot cheaper – and so is the stock.Just before Thanksgiving, Crain’s noted that the premium to borrow shares “fell from more than 90% to about 30% early this week, opening the door for short sales, which put downward pressure on a stock price.”It also put downward pressure on the premiums we saw in those put options.Just to recap, this position back on November 15, which would have included shorting GRPN, shorting a December ATM put, and buying a December ATM call would have resulted in a “locked in” profit of $127 per contract.  And wouldn’t you know it? At the time, that 90% hard-to-borrow fee (quoted as an annual fee), worked out to be about $120 per contract for the approximate one month until December expiration. So that premium really wasn’t “free money.”Now that the stock costs less to borrow, that put-call disparity has eased significantly. That premium is now a lot less – only $30 as of November 23. Yes, the December expiration is a lot closer now, but that $30 is approximately what it would cost to be short the stock using the 30% annual fee cited by Crain’s.Here’s a chart comparing the ATM put-call option premium on both November 15 and November 23 for various expirations –shown on a per-day basis. Back on November 15. the cost of those ATM puts relative to ATM calls was a whole lot higher. Not only has the much of that premium for December evaporated, we also see that the premium went down across other expiration months.High demand for puts a factor?I often get asked if puts get expensive relative to calls because there’s more demand to buy them.When the options are at the money, no that’s not the case. The principle of put-call parity should keep those prices similar – unless there’s a dividend, shares are hard to borrow, or there are other extraneous factors (such as a high interest rate climate).But when it comes to the out-of-the-money options, that’s a different story. You will often (if not usually) see a skew that shows OTM puts more expensive than OTM calls. To a great extent, that premium can reflect a higher demand for puts vs. calls.Let’s take a look at out of the money calls and puts for Groupon. The options have only been trading a couple of weeks, but I took the data available on skew and calculated hypothetical option prices. These charts show those prices as a percentage of the price of GRPN itself.Here’s the cost for hypothetical options that are 10% out of the money – for both 90 days and 180 days And here’s a similar chart for options that are 20% out of the money. These charts show a fairly rich premium for the puts compared to the calls. Note that in percentage terms, the 10% OTM options with 90 days until expiration cost about the same as those that are 20% out of the money but expire three months later.Selling some of those OTM puts might be tempting, but this stock sank below its initial IPO price the day before and these options aren’t all that liquid.I’m steering clear, but if you think this stock has hit bottom, a short put spread and/or long call spread strategy might be attractive.

311152,23407,2011-12-01T03:40:55-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) rode the black Friday weekend sales wave with 500% growth in holiday sales from last year.  Investors who watched shares sink 50% from their IPO peak welcomed the news.  But does the Groupon back story suggest investors should pick up shares?In Q2, Groupon had gross billings of $909.2 million.  But factor out the payments to vendors supplying the deals and sales drop to $392.6 million.  While a $1.6 billion run rate is nothing to sneeze at, a $10 billion market cap still seems rich - particularly given the company's expected $700 million quarterly marketing budget. On top of that, over $400 million in 2010 losses and more coming down the pipeline should make even the most risk tolerant investor shudder.Another cause for concern is management.  I've spent the past few days reading SEC filings of other companies Groupon's founders have brought public, and I can't help but walk away uneasy.Since Groupon's founding, venture capitalists have invested over a billion dollars. But a lot of that money, including nearly $400 million used to buy back shares from co-founder Eric Lefkofsky, was funneled back to early investors.  Mr. Lefkofsky still owned a sizable 22% stake in Groupon heading into the IPO.An article in Fortune back in June highlighted questions surrounding Mr. Lefkofsky, including finances related to his pre-Groupon venture InnerWorkings (NASDAQ:INWK). Mr. Lefkofsky brought InnerWorkings public in 2006 at $9 and the stock peaked at $19 three months later.Despite one attempt in 2008, InnerWorkings stock hasn't been close to that level again. It currently trades below $9. The IPO, however, was a big win for Mr. Lefkofsky who sold an additional five million shares in a follow on offering for $13.50 per share. Mr. Lefkofsky remains a major owner of the company through Orange Media LLC, whose sole member is Eric Lefkofsky's wife Elizabeth. At the end of last year, Orange Media LLC, along with Richard Heise, Jr, owned 21.6% of InnerWorkings stock.InnerWorkings itself is heavily reliant on its biggest customers. The top ten represented 31% of sales in 2010. Non-sticky transactions accounted for nearly 30% of sales.  Overall, more than 60% of InnerWorkings sales are tied to either big accounts or one-off transactions. Like Groupon, InnerWorkings is dependent on scale and at risk from client turnover in a hyper competitive market.  Also like Groupon, InnerWorkings' business model is driven by high cash burn.InnerWorkings has been very acquisitive. This has helped grow the top line, but done little to bolster the company's cash position, which stood just shy of $27 million in 2007 before dropping to $2.9 million in 2009. Last year, the company finished with $5.2 million.  At the same time, unbilled revenue has climbed.  Such revenue was $24.6 million in 2010, up from $20.2 million in 2009.  Which leads us to another company founded by Mr. Lefkofsky.  Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ:ECHO) has fared a bit better.  It IPO'd in October 2009, traded as high as $14 that month and currently trades around $15.50.   But like InnerWorkings, Echo is heavily reliant on scale and big accounts, which account for 32% of sales. The other 68% of sales come from less sticky transactions. And, just like InnerWorkings, the company has been very acquisitive. Over the first nine months of this year, Echo's revenue increased $127.4 million from 2010. However, $125 million came from acquisitions, which suggests anemic organic growth.As a result, Echo's cash and equivalents have barely budged, finishing last quarter at $44.19 million, up slightly from $43.2 million at year-end. Accounts receivables, however, spiked to $84.2 million from $60.3 million during the same period.And, looking through Echo's SEC filings presents some interesting relationships between the founders and the companies themselves. For example, In January 2007, Echo inked a deal with Holden Ventures, LLC, a consultancy owned by Echo director - and Groupon co-founder - Bradley Keywell. In the deal, Mr. Keywell, through Holden, received over $200k in consulting compensation in 2006 and 2007. He also got options on 250,000 shares at $2.20 per share in recognition of his service to the company. Later, in June 2009, a group of directors operating as EGL Mezzanine loaned Echo $7.5 million at 13%. The majority owner of EGL Mezzanine, with a 67% stake, is Blue Media, which in turn is 100% owned by Mr. Lefkofsky. Both Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky have made out nicely on Echo.Interestingly, InnerWorkings has been a big beneficiary of Echo's going public too. Back in 2005, InnerWorkings acquired 2 million shares of Echo for $125,000. In the ensuing years, the company has been selling its position at hefty gains. By 2009, its position had dropped to 1.255 million shares. And, at the end of 2010, the company was still sitting on $2.799 million in unrealized gains after disposing of 271.9k shares, which produced a gain of $3.578 million. This is a fantastic return on its $125k investment, however, again it has done little to boost InnerWorkings' balance sheet.It's also not surprising, given the inter-relationships and stock position, that InnerWorkings is an Echo customer. Echo billed InnerWorks $2.7 million in 2008 - up from $748k in 2007. Last year, Echo billed InnerWorkings $5.7 million. In the nine months ending September, Echo billed InnerWorkings $6.1 million, $3.1 million of which came in Q3 alone. In reciprocal fashion, but to a much smaller extent, Echo is a customer of InnerWorkings.  InnerWorkings charged Echo $60k for services in 2010, down from a peak of $140k in 2009. The deals across InnerWorkings and Echo expand to include Groupon too, with each helping the other through subleasing office space. In April 2010, Echo agreed to sublease from InnerWorkings, paying the $12,000 a month. In 2010, Echo paid InnerWorkings some $108k under the agreement. In August '09, InnerWorkings agreed with Groupon for Groupon to lease office space too. Groupon paid $18k a month, including $54k in the first three months of 2010.Once the sublease with Groupon ended, InnerWorkings entered into a new deal with Groupon related to corporate procurement cards. The Q2 2010 deal allowed Groupon to obtain such cards under InnerWorkings existing credit arrangement. In exchange, Groupon pays InnerWorkings $64k a year. We can't forget Echo, which also had a deal to sublease space to Groupon from May 2009 through April 2011. In the 9 months ending Q3, Echo had received $37k in rental income from Groupon.Echo, with trailing sales of $553 million, sports a market cap of $346 million. Meanwhile, InnerWorkings, with 12 month trailing sales of $589 million, has a market cap of $395 million. Should Groupon be valued significantly higher to sales? Possibly. But, all three are scale-driven enterprises operating in highly competitive fields. On the surface, doing business with one another makes sense, particularly if the companies can leverage savings. Of course, this assumes due diligence is being done too.  At times, entrepreneurs have to provide additional funding and certainly management deserves to unlock its considerable investment for profit.  However, these actions don't necessarily translate into shareholder gains. And, at a minimum, all the moving pieces of limited partnerships, consultancies and financing deals raise questions which are often the enemy of shareholder profits. All the information is disclosed in SEC filings such as 10-Qs, and anyone interested in buying shares in Groupon should read all of InnerWorkings' and Echo' filings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in INWK, ECHO over the next 72 hours."
310420,24455,2011-11-28T05:02:59-05:00,,"When Groupon  (GRPN) broke issue price last week, the naysayers who had predicted it took a victory lap around the IPO Arena. But the life cycle of the IPO has not yet been played out.To begin with, an IPO has a life of its own during its opening day of trading. Its aftermarket price action is not affected by current stock market conditions.This is the only time all the IPO players come together – the investors, the flippers and the day traders. The investors adjust their portfolios, the flippers are usually out on the opening trade and the click-dot-traders thrive on high volume and volatility.Their collective wheeling and dealing result in heavy opening-day volume and the IPO’s price can be volatile.In the following days, you can see the “hot money” flowing out of the IPO. It moves on to other trading opportunities, the flippers are long gone, and all that’s left are investors.Back to the BeginningLet’s take a look at Groupon’s first trading day and beyond.On the evening of Nov. 3, Groupon priced 35 million shares at $20 each.Day No.1On Nov. 4, Groupon’s IPO traded as high as $31.14, as low as $25.90, and closed at $26.11 on a volume of 49.8 million shares. That’s a turnover ratio of 142.3 percent.Day No.2On Nov. 5, Groupon’s IPO traded as high as $27.78, as low as $24.59, and closed at $25.97 on a volume of 9.5 million shares.Day No. 3On Nov. 6, Groupon’s IPO traded as high as $26.21, as low as $24.76, and closed at $24.90 on a volume of 4.3 million shares.A Week After Opening DayOn Nov. 11, Groupon’s IPO traded as high as $25, as low as $23.41, and closed at $24.25 on a volume of 1.3 million shares.By then, the Groupon IPO had moved into the next stage of its life cycle. It is the twilight zone of the “quiet period” and, by law, the underwriters can not give out any investment guidance.The “quiet period” prohibits those involved in the underwriting and distribution of an IPO from promoting the stock for a period of 28 days. For the company and its managing underwriters, the “quiet period” is extended to 40 days. The latter was an outgrowth of the 1999/2000 insanity-dot-com IPO days.As a result, the IPO’s unseasoned securities fall under the influence of the stock market and its investors must wait until its underwriters can initiate research coverage.Exception to the RuleHowever – and there’s always a however – any investment advisory firm, research firm or broker/dealer not involved in the underwriting process is free to comment on any IPO at any time.In Groupon’s case, as of Friday, Nov. 25, five brokers had initiated research coverage, according to Thomson First Call. None were involved with its underwriting.Two rated the stock as a “buy,” two as a “hold” and one as a “sell.” Their price targets ranged from $35 to $15 with a mean target of $26 per share.Groupon closed on Friday, Nov. 25, at $16.75 per share.Some Numbers Worth NotingNow here’s where it gets informative – the Thomson First Call financial estimates for Groupon, compared with the company’s actual results for 2010:Actual Revenues for Year Ended Dec. 31, 2010: $312 millionEstimated Revenues for Year Ended 2011: $1.6 billionEstimated Revenues for Year Ended 2012: $2.38 billionEstimated Revenues for Year Ended 2013: $2.85 billionActual Net Loss for Year Ended Dec. 31, 2010: $389 million - or a loss of $1.33 per shareEstimated Net Loss for Year Ended 2011: $321.9 million or a loss of 64 cents per share on more shares outstanding**Estimated Net Income for Year Ended 2012: $154.7 million or 14 cents per share**Estimated Net Income for Year Ended 2013: $480.6 million or 41 cents per share**Note the projected switch from an annual net loss to profitability, beginning with the year ended 2012. Bookmark Dec. 14, 2011. That is the day when the Groupon IPO exits from its 28-day “quiet period” and then add another 12 days for date when the company and its managing underwriters are free to talk.What’s more, IPOs have been known to run up ahead of the expiration of their quiet periods on anticipation of favorable research initiations by their underwriters.That pretty much finishes the life cycle of an IPO.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional Disclosure: Neither the author nor anyone else on the IPOScoop.com staff has a position in any stocks mentioned, nor do they trade or invest in IPOs.

310687,24663,2011-11-29T07:06:01-05:00,,"When a high profile company files for its initial IPO, three things are likely: the company's stock will have a huge jump on its first day; the stock will then fall hard during the coming weeks; and finally, the stock will post massive gains from its low price. After these three events the rest depends on the company and the market's perception of the company and its future.However, as we all know, IPOs haven't been the greatest performers over the last year. Nearly everyone is fully aware of the first two events that take place with a stock rising then falling, yet, rarely do investors notice or discuss the rise after the fall. I believe this play could be an investor's easiest and surest way to return gains in this volatile market. To better explain, I have used 4 high profile IPOs of last year and will use it to better explain what's ahead for Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).Renren (RENN) began trading on May 5 and reached a high of $24, a market cap of nearly $9.5 billion. The stock has since declined, and now trades with a market cap of $1.4 billion and a price of $3.60. The stock's initial reaction was a result of optimism surrounding its striking similarities to social networking giant Facebook. However, as we've learned, there is only one Facebook. RENN operates in China, which is a growing region in one of the most populated areas of the world.Therefore, it created a lot of excitement when the company first became public. But, as you can see in the above chart, the stock then fell hard from May 5 till June 24, by nearly 70%. However, the stock then recovered, from June 24 till July 7, to post gains of 73%. This stock was the first of the social networking IPO stocks of 2011 to trade in this manner. To better explain, let's look at a few more. The second was perhaps the most hyped stock of the bunch, and definitely the most volatile, Linkedin (LNKD). The stock took the market by storm when it more than doubled on the day of its IPO with a mindboggling market cap of nearly $12 billion and a price of $122.70. The stock then declined by nearly 50% in approximately one month, only to recover with very strong gains. As you can see in the chart, the stock trended above $100 after its initial drop and posted gains of 75% in approximately three weeks.There have been many analysts to warn investors of this stock because of its high valuation compared to its fundamentals. Yet, because of its fast growth, investors have ignored and have continued to buy the stock regardless of its high valuation. I'm quite pessimistic of this stock because I don't believe its growth is sustainable, and although I enjoy Linkedin much more than Facebook it doesn't appeal to the same number of consumers as Facebook. Therefore, I believe its growth will stall at some point in the future and that it will be very difficult for LNKD to maintain its growth as I consider it to be more like Myspace than Facebook. Pandora (P) is probably my favorite of the bunch because of its lack of competition and its importance to the smartphone experience. During the company's recent success it's done a great job at capitalizing and growing off its success and I believe that Pandora could be the company to change the way we experience music for many years to come. However, much like the other stocks on this list, it's traded in the same pattern, including its large gains during its IPO. When the company became public it traded to highs of $24; however, it fell much faster than the other stocks on this list.Within 5 days the stock had lost nearly 50% of its value, which I believe was a result of the previous trends in LNKD and RENN along with investors learning the tendencies of high profile IPO stocks. Yet, much like LNKD and RENN, the stock posted large gains to follow its initial loss, and gained 50% in just 9 days. The stock has since followed the same trend of other stocks to become public in 2011 and has posted a large amount of loss, which makes me suggest that maybe these stocks are trading more on technicals and not fundamental growth. Much like the other three stocks on this list, Zillow has followed the same trend. It posted a high of $60 during its IPO only to fall by 60% in only one month. The stock then increased by 55% during the following 8 trading days before selling off. As a long-term investment I'm undecided on Zillow because I don't know how the company will perform once the real estate market is stable.As of now, I believe the stock is a buy because it gives agents an edge in a competitive real estate market and the company's done a great job at growing its revenue and profit during each quarter since becoming public. And because it only has a small percentage of all listed agents in the U.S., I believe there is still room to grow. My only question is if the company can continue to grow if the real estate market improves and the need for additional marketing becomes a luxury and not a necessity. After looking at four of the most high profile speculative IPOs, we can now focus on perhaps the most speculative high profile stock and that is Groupon. The whole purpose of identifying the trends of the four stocks above is to show similarities to Groupon. The stock reached a high of $31.14 during its IPO but has since trended lower and closed on Monday at $15.24 for a 9% loss, as most stocks were trending higher.According to recent history this trend is normal and if this stock trades like the other four on this list then it will most likely post gains in the immediate future. Each of the stocks above lost at least 50% from their high before turning to trend higher. And since GRPN is currently trading with a 50% loss from its high, now is the time to buy. Each stock on this list returned at least 50% from its initial drop; therefore, with GRPN being the most speculative and having the most investors that are either bearish or bullish, it will most definitely post the same level of gains.The consistency of this pattern may be the most consistent trend within the market. I have only noticed this pattern among companies that operate with an online model, through the cloud, or have a dependency on social media. This theory hasn't been as successful with established companies with less speculation such as GNC Holdings (NYSE:GNC), HCA Holdings (NYSE:HCA), or even Dunkin Brands Group (NASDAQ:DNKN). And although I'm not sure why this trend wouldn't occur within these stocks, I do have a few beliefs.The difference between stocks such as DNKN and GRPN is the perception among investors. Dunkin is an established company with physical locations that has operated with success for many years, along with GNC. However, the new companies that have filed for IPOs over the last year such as LNKD, RENN, P, Z, and GRPN are all speculative companies with investors having strong opinions of either hating or loving the stock. There are very few in between who have neutral outlooks on these companies. As a result, I believe it creates a large amount of volatility within the stock.Another theory is that a large number of investors purchase a speculative high profile stock the day of its IPO with no intention to hold. These investors are just buying and hoping to profit from the large gains of the IPO but have plans to sell the first chance they get. I understand this concept first hand because I purchased shares of GRPN and LNKD the day of its IPO but had no plans on holding the stock long-term. As a result, the stock falls to a level in which those who are bullish of its future feel confident in purchasing the stock, which causes a domino affect as others with long-term goals purchase at low prices as well.My opinion on why stocks fall then return gains after filing for an initial IPO is as speculative as the stock itself. The truth is that I don't know why this has occurred over the last year or why it's occurred so regularly. But what I do know is that GRPN could be an investor's best chance to capitalize on quick gains. And if this stock follows the trend of other speculative stocks, which it has to this point, then it will most likely return large gains of potentially 50% during the next month.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours."
310031,24125,2011-11-23T17:28:49-05:00,,"A few months ago, I wrote about how Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) had been using a non-GAAP accounting metric, “adjusted consolidated segment operating income,” to explain its past performance — a practice the online coupon company has since given up. Well, Groupon’s questionable accounting practices are back in the news: A few days after the company launched its initial public offering on 4 November with just a 5.5% float, the second smallest of any IPO in the past ten years, The Wall Street Journal reported that many merchants are dissatisfied with how slowly Groupon disperses payments, a practice that can make a company’s cash position look stronger on its books.Have you heard that song performed by the Propellerheads and Shirley Bassey titled “History Repeating”? It goes something like this:Groupon’s accounting practices certainly have a familiar ring. Remember a decade ago when MicroStrategy shares collapsed after the company was forced to restate its books? Remember the dot-com bubble? Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of companies ran afoul of the Securities & Exchange Commission and were forced to restate their financial statements because of overly aggressive revenue recognition.The online coupon company seems to have headed down this same path. On 23 September, the company announced that it would change the way that it accounts for revenue after discussions with the SEC. (Wouldn’t you have liked to have been a fly on that wall?) Previously, the company not only recognized as revenue the commissions it received on sales of coupons/gift certificates, but it also recognized the total value of those coupons and gift certificates. On a going-forward basis, Groupon agreed to report only its commissions as revenue. This move reduced its reported revenue for the three months ending 31 March 2011 by almost 50%, from $713.4 million to $312.9 million. Now that’s a haircut!Historically, revenue recognition has often been a source of controversy, especially for companies that are planning to go public. In the somewhat crude parlance of financial statement preparers, “Revenue recognition issues are to the technology and biotechnology industries what acne is to teenagers — part of growing up!”That’s because revenue is the first line item on the income statement, and it is the primary determinant of a company’s profitability. As a result, companies — especially those searching for new investors — are under intense pressure to report robust revenue growth. That is particularly true, as The New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin recently pointed out, of companies like Groupon that carry a working capital deficit. In Groupon’s most recent SEC filing, the company reported a 1,367% increase in revenue for the three months ending 31 March 2011 versus the same period in 2010. Unfortunately, during the same period, its growth margin declined from 45.1% to 41.9%.Given that Groupon isn’t the first company — nor will it probably be the last — to engage in questionable accounting practices shortly before going public, what are analysts and investors to do?For starters, go back to basics. Any analyst worth his or her salt must read a company’s SEC filings carefully. As the Groupon filing states, “Revenue primarily consists of the gross amount paid by customers for purchased Groupons, excluding any applicable taxes, less customer refunds and obligations related to credits earned for customer loyalty and reward programs.” The company goes on to disclose: “We believe gross profit is an important indicator for our business because it is a reflection of the value of our service to our merchants. Gross profit is influenced by the mix of deals we offer. For example, gross profit can vary depending on the category of product or service offered in a particular deal. Likewise, gross profit can be adversely impacted by offers that we make for the principal purpose of acquiring new subscribers or establishing our brand and building scale in a new market.” The company attributes the decline in gross margin to the “mix of offered deals and their offer of several national deals to generate revenue and increase brand awareness.”Investors should, of course, approach financial statements with a healthy dose of skepticism. We can’t just eat what companies are feeding us. Instead, we must scrutinize, analyze, and interpret what company executives are putting on our plate, and conduct both a smell test and a taste test. Below are links to some good articles on revenue recognition and related accounting issues that all financial analysts should keep top of mind as they search for the next Google."
311857,25158,2011-12-05T11:53:52-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has incurred a net loss annually since the company’s inception. As of the end of the first quarter of 2011, the local online advertiser faced an accumulated deficit of $522.1 million dollars. Groupon makes their money by keeping 50% of what the customer pays for the coupons it advertises on its website and mobile applications. While that sounds financially lucrative at first glance, a closer look at its business model exposes serious viability issues.Groupon’s success is for the most part dependent upon two critical operating metrics: (1) Growth of subscribers who actually purchase vouchers, and (2) attracting new merchants to its already expansive list. As of March 31 this year, Groupon had more than 83 million subscribers while advertising the products and services of 56,781 merchants (the number of merchants featured in the first quarter 2011).While Groupon has seen incredible growth since its infant days in 2008, it is highly unlikely to keep pace in the years to come. The primary reason for this is competition. When current CEO Andrew Mason thought of the idea for Groupon, there was little to no business entities in the arena. Now, there are more than 500 sites worldwide, with over 100 in the United States. Yes, Groupon has penetrated markets in South America, Europe, and the Middle East, but what have they done to distinguish themselves? What is unique about the service they provide? What do they offer that no other company can? The answer is - nothing.The only way for Groupon to succeed in subscriber and merchant growth in the long term is to separate itself from the competition. High growth companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been able to thrive because of their ability to innovate. There is nothing in Groupon’s business model that ensures it stays one step ahead of the competition. Big companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), through its investment backing of LivingSocial, have seized opportunities and enjoyed success. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which once tried to acquire Groupon for approximately 6 billion dollars, has ventured into the field with its new Google Offers program. With close to a billion subscribers, Facebook will also inevitably become a dominant player in the game. Without that “it” factor, Groupon cannot continue to add subscribers anywhere near its historical rate.The presence of other companies also provides plenty of options to merchants. Merchants may find better voucher percentage sharing programs with other companies or a faster reimbursement system (Groupon pays its merchants 60 days after the coupon has been redeemed). With more than one company providing a nearly identical advertising service, and the possibility of better financial arrangements, it will be difficult for Groupon to maintain growth in its merchant index.Interestingly, the 2 components vital to Groupon’s success were also the two critical driving forces behind another popular company that has recently come under intense pressure – Netflix. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was dependent on not only growing its subscriber base for its DVD and online streaming service, but also to retain and add to its content providers. Netflix succeeded in both areas for some time and saw it’s stock skyrocket as a result. However, the moment it suffered a retraction in the number of subscribers this past quarter, it’s stock took a swan dive (it is currently trading at just over 20% of its year-to-date high). The subscriber loss was largely attributed to an increase in monthly fees. Presumably, executives felt it necessary to raise fees to grow profits as opposed to concentrating on subscriber growth. If that is the case, it cannot bode well for Groupon, which already operates at a loss while reaping a hefty percentage (50%) of the profits with its merchants.Coincidentally, Netflix shares a common enemy with Groupon, namely Amazon. Amazon has built a formidable library of streaming titles in its Amazon Prime service by striking deals with CBS and NBC Universal. In addition, Time Warner has expanded its streaming video service and Apple has slowly been adding video streaming to its iTunes service. Netflix’s loss in subscribers is one factor in their recent troubles. They have also struggled in maintaining content. It lost its contract with Starz and will not be able to have access to big name movies from the likes of Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) after February 2012. Ultimately, Netflix was a ""growth stock"" that stopped growing.Groupon seems destined to follow the same path as Netflix. While it may have some success in the short term like Netflix, competition with deeper pockets will eventually catch up harming subscriber and merchant growth. As this happens, the current deficit will spiral out of control, quarterly losses will continue, and its stock will take a significant hit.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The problem is that we don't in fact know whether the underlying business model makes sense yet. No, not Groupon's model, but the underlying one.There's a cautionary tale from the UK about this:Clearly such a discount on a physical good (the original price is more like £26) isn't going to be profitable for the supplier: but perhaps a loss leader is a good way to advertise the place? Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't: what we're beginning to see in those places that small businesses talk to each other about these things is that it isn't.There are other parts of the story that don't bode well for Groupon: Now whether it really happened quite that way is being disputed but there have been other such cases of claimed overselling (one mentioned in the same piece).But that's not really my point here. I've had mild dealings with one of the other companies (essentially, just talking through what we might make as an offer) and there's much pressure from the corporate end that the offer should be of ""something."" Cupcakes, a restaurant meal, some physical item: and also that the deal on offer should be at a very large, 50% or more, discount to usual prices.There's a great reluctance to take services or memberships, intangibles that do or could have the margins necessary to support such large discounts. Sure, this could well be just a refelction of the buying preferences of the customers, but it really is something of a problem for the business model in the long term.Physical items simply cannot take the 75% or more margin cuts that are near required to be offered as a featured Groupon (and the same is true of the other companies) and yet there's a great reluctance to offer the types of services that can support those margin cuts.Which rather leaves one wondering where the long-term growth is. 75% off offerings work great if you have fixed or near fixed costs and marginal production costs of near zero. They simply don't if you have a marginal production cost of 30% to 50% of regular cost. Then it's a loss leader and that's a much more risky proposition for a small business.This is what I regard as the real problem with Groupon. Is the underlying business idea itself viable in the long term? Forget whether they have good management, leave aside competition or financing issues for a moment and ponder: does it actually make sense for a business to sign up to offer a Groupon when they know they're going to lose money on it?Or alternatively, how long is the supply of such businesses going to last?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
309898,22762,2011-11-23T12:11:54-05:00,,"By Rip EmpsonYou don’t need to work on Wall Street to have seen this one coming: Today, for the first time since its NASDAQ debut on November 4th, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has fallen below its IPO price, which initially placed the company’s stock at $20 per share. The company’s stock opened (at first trade) at $28 per share, with a market cap of $17.8 billion.It’s currently hovering at about $17.30 per share, down nearly 14 percent on the day. The daily deal behemoth’s stock has been on a three-day slide, and this marks the third day in a row of double digit declines. This came after the stock hit its all-time (really, all-month since IPO) high on Friday at $26.19 per share.Welcome to the public markets, Groupon.Some might say that, although Groupon was up 31 percent before this week, raised $700 million selling 35 million shares at $20 each before going public on November 4th — mind you, the biggest IPO since Google in 2004 — the decline was inevitable. That there’s no way that the company’s current performance (and short-term prospects) work out to a $15 billion+ market cap and sky-high valuation. (You can read our assessment of Groupon’s value in contrast with soon-to-IPO Zynga here.)But it also seems that the recent decline of Groupon’s stock is a result of just how many shares it sold at IPO. Groupon sold about 5.5 percent of its stock on November 4th (of its 637.3 million shares outstanding), meaning that a relatively small amount of stock was available to short sellers. As Crain’s points out, the premium to borrow shares (in advance of shorting) dropped from 90 percent to 30 percent early this week. And it looks like the short-sellers are moving fast and furiously.The next few months will no doubt be marked by a series of ups and downs, and it will be fascinating to see where Groupon’s stock bottoms out. I have no dog in the fight and, frankly, am optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects and want to see them be successful, but I think they have a long way to fall yet.More to come.Original post"
309750,20851,2011-11-22T19:32:01-05:00,,"By Chris PrestonWe told you last week Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) was headed for a fall.  Well, the daily online deals company is back trading at its IPO  price less than three weeks after the most profitable debut for a  technology stock since Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Shares of Groupon fell nearly 15% today to return to their  original IPO price of $20 a share. The tech stock had climbed as high as  $31.14 share during an initial public offering in which it raised $700  million, the highest for a tech stock since Google hit the market in 2004.But reality has now set in for a company that has never been  profitable. Its stellar debut was more a product of an extremely small  share float than anything substantive. In truth, Groupon was wildly  overvalued.And it still is. Profitability may again prove elusive this quarter  with Groupon’s marketing costs surging and increased competition from  LivingSocial.com, a rival daily deals site with backing from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Renewed concern about another dot-com bubble also hasn’t helped Groupon’s case.Morningstar analyst Rick Summer thinks that Groupon is worth closer to  $8 a share. StockTwits CEO Howard Lindzon told Bloomberg that the  Groupon IPO was a “rushed deal.”As we noted last week in this space, Groupon’s post-IPO honeymoon was  unsustainable. The company manipulated the IPO process to earn a market  capitalization it didn’t deserve.Now it’s paying the price. Or, more literally, investors aren't."

Growth rates are already slowing, and the whole business model simply is one where many business owners do not see the return of giving away 50% of their revenue stream for a customer who is not 'sticky'. Here is what I wrote the day it came public in early November:But in the short run, I thought with such a tiny float (the newest Wall Street gimmick to elevate prices), would keep the stock going until at least the first lock up. I was wrong on that count - the stock fell 15% yesterday and has already busted the IPO price. Another example of 'sold to you' by the Wall Street syndicate.While still an expensive stock to short (20% margin rate) its far cheaper than it was the previous few weeks when one had to pay 80-90% margin, so at least someone is finally making money on this lipstick covered entity.Via Reuters:Disclosure: No positionOriginal article"
309758,24714,2011-11-22T22:14:36-05:00,,"On November 22nd, a day when the S&P 500 dropped by 41 basis points, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares dropped by a staggering 14.89 percent. Other ""hot stocks"" like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have also experienced large drops recently, but their drops came off of major announcements by the company, earnings disappointments, and severe downgrades by big financial minds. According to this Reuters article, the Groupon drop stemmed from concern about ""increased competition"". The article cites how Living Social announced on Monday that it plans to offer ""more than 20 deals with national merchants"" pertaining to Black Friday deals. However, Groupon opened AT A GAIN on Tuesday. In addition, it's been public knowledge for a long time that Groupon has plenty of competition. Google Offers and Living Social are the big names, and Credit and Debit card rewards programs will continue to expand and look more like deal websites.I always find it odd when stocks take big single day plunges when there is no major news released to the public. However, if this is to happen to any company, Groupon is a good candidate. The stock is grossly overvalued by any valuation metric and other than a subscriber base, the company really has no long term competitive advantage.In addition, the bears are finally gettting to have their say in what Groupon's stock price should be. As time passes, Groupon shares will be easier to short and the price will be brought down. There are also supply and demand issues. Very little of Groupon was actually floated and with other innovative dot coms going public soon like Zynga (ZYNG) and Facebook, there will be more of a stock ""supply"" of young, innovative companies out on the market. I for one like to stay away from any stock that is driven by supply and demand because in the end, value is what you get.I believe that a lot of this year's tech IPOs will face big drops over the next year. Any failure to meet an analyst expectation or a departure by an early institutional investor can cause these stocks to take large short term hits that will add up over time. For example, Bain Capital's sell-off of Linkedin (LNKD) sparked very bearish activity of the stock recently. More of these companies' stocks will continue to become available to the open market and eventually, the supply will outweigh the demand.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The only Internet stock I've seen that's as expensive or more to hedge now is another one that went public this year, Pandora Media, Inc. (NYSE:P). The table below shows that, as well as the costs, as of Thursday's close, of hedging several other leading Internet stocks against greater-than-35% declines over the next several months, using optimal puts.A comparisonFor comparison purposes, I've also added the cost of hedging the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) against the same decline. First, a reminder about what optimal puts are, and a note about why I've used 35% as a decline threshold this time; then, a screen capture showing the optimal puts to hedge Groupon, Inc.About Optimal PutsOptimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor  uses an algorithm developed by a finance Ph.D. to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your position, scanning for the optimal ones.Decline ThresholdsIn this context, ""threshold"" is the maximum decline you are willing to risk. You can enter any percentage you like for a decline threshold when scanning for optimal puts (the higher the percentage though, the greater the chance you will find optimal puts for your position). In the past, when looking at the hedging costs of Internet stocks I've used 25% decline thresholds, but Groupon, Inc. and Pandora Media, Inc. were too expensive to hedge against greater-than-25% declines (i.e., the cost of hedging them against 25% declines was itself more than 25% of position value, so Portfolio Armor indicated there were no optimal contracts available for them). 35% was the smallest decline threshold for which there were optimal contracts for all of these stocks, so that's the decline threshold I've used here.The optimal puts for GRPNBelow is a screen capture showing the optimal put option contract to buy to hedge 100 shares of GRPN against a greater-than-35% drop between now and April 20, 2012. A note about these optimal put options and their cost: to be conservative, Portfolio Armor calculated the cost based on the ask price of the optimal puts. In practice an investor can often purchase puts for a lower price, i.e., some price between the bid and the ask.(Click to enlarge)Hedging costs as of Thursday's close  The table below shows the costs of hedging these stocks against greater-than-35% declines over the next several months, as of Thursday's close.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Even this morning the stock opened higher, trading at $24.75 before a massive intraday correction took place. Right now the stock is off 14% trading at $20.50, at one point today trading just 3 cents above its offering price.The Google factor Last year the search-giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) tried to acquire the then privately held firm based in Chicago for about $6bn. Despite today's slide, a $20 price still implies a market value of $12bn. Analysts are pointing out that Groupon might have created an artificial shortage of shares for investors to buy by offering just 5% of the company in its IPO when it raised $700mn last month.Increased competition Well known is the structural weakness in Groupon's business model, being the ""low cost of entry"" for competitors. With the crucial shopping weeks coming ahead, competitor Livingsocial announced 20 deals with nationwide merchants ahead of Friday's crucial Black Friday shopping day. These kind of deals are targeted at obtaining large amounts of customers at little or no profits, raising fears that Groupon might end up in a classic price war.Accounting/business practices in September, even before the IPO the company shocked the investment community by a large change in its accounting practices. No longer could it add merchants' payments to its own revenues. As a result it restated its half year revenue from $1.52bn to $688mn, on which it still lost $248mn. Common are stories about local deals gone bad and merchants complaining about the large cut Groupon is taking.Risk-off With hindsight it seems that Groupon perfectly used the brief window of opportunity the IPO market provided last month. New issues including Linkedin (LNKD) and Fusion-Io (NYSE:FIO) have seen impressive initial returns but all saw significant double-digit corrections in recent weeks. Increased competition, questionable accounting practices and a small free float were all known for months, Groupon just got hammered as the next high-beta stock fallen victim to the ""risk-off"" mode.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
306917,25090,2011-11-10T09:09:21-05:00,,"Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) long-awaited IPO has now come and gone while speculation continues to spread at a feverish pace. My opinion of Groupon's situation has led me to be bearish on the trade. My sentiment is due to one simple aspect of any business; the competition. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook are all looking to capitalize on the ""Social Commerce"" wave which will present Groupon with a number of significant challenges to the core of their business and leadership. The objective of this article is to analyze Groupon's real value and where it ranks among the competition.Is Groupon Really Significant?The first time I heard the words ""Social Commerce"" was in 2007 at a software leadership summit hosted by IBM. The focus of the summit was social commerce and how online retailers could leverage various social activities to strengthen cross channel support. Groupon's contribution from a strictly ""social"" perspective is minimal but the social connotation sticks with them because it became relevant at just the right time; the quintessential ""right place at the right time"" paradigm.Groupon's user community may interact with one another in a limited capacity by posting reviews of deals. Groupon's unique feature was a defined sales channel waiting for vendors twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week, consisting of consumers eager for the next daily deal. Of course, geo location adds to the overall appeal by allowing a vendor to offer consumers local deals it would not have the opportunity to offer on a national level. Geo location played a primary role in Groupon's initial success but by no means offered any significant competitive advantage.The bullish argument that Groupon is the rightful ""market leader"" doesn't ring with me. I'm not overwhelmed by Groupon's accomplishments as far as being an innovator within the realm of social commerce. Remember Lycos, AOL and MySpace? These were market leaders at one point in the internet's brief commercial history. In my opinion, Groupon made the mistake no tech company can afford to make: It became comfortable and complacent, and then overlooked the responsibilities required by any successful online business. Consistent innovation and adding value for the consumer and vendor are imperative to Groupon's business model.Sizing The CompetitionEstimates regarding the number of competitors now in the ""Deal-Of-The-Day"" social commerce arena are north of 350 with the top 10 being the only real threats. Even so, small competitors will continue to dilute Groupon's market share. It's one thing to have market share dissipate slowly over a longer period, but when your competition goes from micro-competitors to Google, Amazon and Facebook the losses can rack up in a single day. Groupon has just begun feeling the pinch of Google methodically moving in for the takeover. Google, Amazon and Facebook are responsible for the innovation driving the evolution of the web for the last decade. There are fundamental differences between a company like Groupon in comparison to a Google, Amazon or Facebook. To illustrate, the sections below consist of a shortlist of ""milestone"" achievements Google, Amazon and Facebook have made over the past decade.Facebook's ContributionsFacebook hasn't innovated as much on the technology forefront as Google and Amazon, but it is responsible for the social web billions of users utilize each day. Facebook had its work cut out for it initially because MySpace ended up being sort of an infection on the surface of the web. Everything was completely disorganized and there was no semblance of order. MySpace maintained the appearance of misguided creativity as opposed to the social icon Facebook has become. Facebook has created a level of communication that just a decade ago would've been considered a burden. Politically, it has become a vehicle for revolution, promoter of democracy and a fear to tyrannical dictators. To put it mildly Facebook is a historical figure and an American Icon.Google's ContributionsWhen a company's mission is to ""organize the world's information"", you realize you're dealing with a company willing to take on great challenges. I also feel it stepped in at just the right time. There was a time when the web looked like it was headed in the wrong direction and I credit Google with steering users, politicians and organizations in the right direction. Google has also pioneered certain aspects of mobile computing, cloud computing solutions used by hundreds of thousands globally, distributed computing and grid computing platforms that are some of the most complex and powerful software ever developed, Google Maps, Gmail, Google+ and more specific to this article, Google Offers.Amazon's ContributionsLast but not least, the financial backers of LivingSocial.com, Amazon. Amazon is typically known as being the number one online retailing giant, but it also achieved a huge amount of success by building one of the most efficient fulfillment services in the world. An ever bigger surprise to some is finding out Amazon pioneered what most people know as ""Cloud Computing"". Amazon is the architect of the first true enterprise cloud computing platform, which I believe, will spearhead the next evolution of the web. Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) platform is the blueprint all other cloud platforms us as a model. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are considered the runners up in the cloud computing platform space, but would likely take them years to catch up to Amazon. I'm not going to go into great detail regarding Amazon's EC2 platform because there is so much to cover, but I will say this: Amazon has spent over 5 years perfecting its platform which will likely run a majority of America's big business when the transition to a managed infrastructure becomes the standard. The transition has begun and will continue for at least a decade.Groupon's Worst Nightmare - Google OffersKnowing what Google, Amazon and Facebook are capable of, does it seem realistic that Groupon can compete? My answer to the question is a definitive ""no"".Google, like it or not, has been known to make decent ideas, great ideas. So what will Google do to make the Google Offers service so much better than Groupon's ""Deal Of The Day""? The common complaint regarding Groupon's service is from vendors. Groupon takes too much of the profit and if a vendor's deal isn't a featured vendor it won't get much exposure. Google's primary advantage is the number of channels it can use to promote vendor deals. Google Search, Gmail, YouTube and Google Shopping are just a few of many channels it will utilize to display vendor deals as well as register new customers. In respect to registering new customers, if you already have an account with any of Google's existing services, you simply configure your Google Offers profile and you're ready to start buying deals. In addition to increased vendor exposure, Google provides vendors with the following advantages:The intention of this article isn't to slam Groupon. I think it's important investors who are trading the hype realize what Groupon is up against. I think the delay of the IPO and the repeated redrafting of the S-1 are a direct result of Groupon and its underwriters realizing the challenges that lay ahead. I think it will take a miracle of divine proportion for them to reclaim the coveted title of ""market leader""; then again anything is possible in these current market conditions. At the end of the day, the moral of the story is that it does pay to be first, but it will always pay more to be the best.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
308694,20851,2011-11-17T13:13:40-05:00,,"Groupon (Nasdaq: GRPN), the online leader in daily  coupon deals, went public on November 4 and sold $700 million worth of  stock in its first day of trading. This was the largest IPO by a tech  stock since Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) raised $1.7 billion in its 2004 stock market debut.But having sold a measly 5.5 percent of itself to the public, Groupon's IPO was more mirage than smashing success.By offering such a small stake in its company to investors, Groupon  tapped into an IPO loophole. The 5.5 percent was the second-smallest  share float in the U.S. in the past decade, according to capital markets  data provider Ipreo. With so few shares available - just 35 million, to  be exact - demand for Groupon IPO shares was overinflated, and allowed  the company to bump up the share-offering price to $20 from its expected  $16 to $18 range at the last minute.Sure, Groupon was able to raise more money in its IPO than any Internet  company since Google, making it seem as if the company's  long-anticipated debut on the stock market was one for the ages. But it  manipulated the IPO process to get there.In a typical IPO, a company offers investors about 20 to 25 percent of  its shares. Admittedly, tech stock IPOs are usually less than that.  Google sold just a 7.2 percent stake in its IPO.LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE: P),  both of which hit the market earlier this year, sold stakes of 8.3  percent and 9.2 percent, respectively. While still small in percentage  of shares sold in their IPOs, these other offerings were meaningfully  larger than Groupon's first-day sale.Groupon has never been profitable since the Chicago-based company was  founded in October 2008. That's right - never in the company's  three-year history has it made money! And yet, because of its rapid  revenue growth and leading stature in the online coupon business,  Groupon was able to 'go public' and now has a market capitalization of  $15.3 billion.$15 billion is a lot of money. Just consider these well-regarded,  established companies - with histories of consistent profits and growth -  that could be bought for less than $15 billion:IPO experts have caught on. Josef Schuster of the Chicago-based IPO research firm IPOX Schuster Inc. told Bloomberg BusinessWeek that ""what Groupon is doing (in its IPO) is way outside what should be acceptable.""More importantly for investors, its stock price is unsustainable.  Groupon's current valuation is more than six times its projected 2012  sales of $2.1 billion. By comparison, Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is trading at about 1.5 times its 2012 revenue, while Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) trades at 2.9 times its projected 2012 revenue.Furthermore, Groupon's revenue growth was actually slowing prior to  going public. The company reported $430 million in revenue in the third  quarter, a 10 percent improvement over the second quarter in which  revenues were up 33 percent from the previous quarter.While its subscriber numbers have skyrocketed the last few years from  150,000 to 83 million, its monthly revenue per subscriber has dipped  from $21.69 in June 2009 to $7.76 after the first quarter this year.In other words, let's not proclaim Groupon the next Google just because  its IPO is being mentioned in the same breath as the world's premier  search engine.For one, Google was six years old when it went public in 2004. While  that may not be the long track record that many investors like to see,  it was twice as old as Groupon when it went public. When it filed its  IPO, Google had turned a profit every year since 2001, including a  whopping $105 million in profits in 2003.Plus, by the time the company went public, the word ""Google"" was  already part of the mainstream lexicon. There are plenty of people today  who wouldn't know whether Groupon is a deals website or a large  saltwater fish.Groupon may yet prove that its IPO wasn't just a flash in the pan.  Perhaps the $700 million it raised will allow the company to cover some  of its operating losses and drum up enough publicity to finally make it  profitable. But that still doesn't change the fact that Groupon is  painfully overvalued at the moment.It found a way to manipulate the IPO process into giving the company a market capitalization it frankly doesn't deserve.Until Groupon proves it can take its interesting online coupon and  local marketing business to the point of consistent profitability, its  pricy shares are unlikely to see much appreciation.Investors today will be better off investing in proven companies whose shares are attractively priced."
308328,24432,2011-11-16T10:08:39-05:00,,"As of Tuesday’s close, at-the-money Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) put options traded at a pretty hefty premium to the same strike calls. For example, with the stock at 24.07, the December 24 puts were bid at $2.75 with the same strike call offered for $1.55.Why the difference? The stock is hard to borrow – really hard to borrow, and expensive too – really expensive.Reuters says the “negative rebate” (the cost to borrow shares to short) was about 90% to 100% last week. That’s an annual charge, which works out to about 4 cents per share per day – or roughly $120 per month for 100 shares.What do the options say?Now let’s take a look at those December optionsLet’s say you bought the December 24 call for $1.55 and sold the December 24 put for $2.75. You’d get a net credit of $120. Here’s how each position looks at expiration.Combine them, and they become a “synthetic long stock” position at 22.80 – the 24 strike less the premium you collected. So now you’re essentially long the stock as shown hereBut if you’re synthetically long at 22.80 and plain short at 24.07 – and you collected a net credit of $120 – you make $127 regardless of where the stock ends up as you can see here:The green area above shows that $127 locked-in profit.That’s pretty darned close to the $120 “negative rebate” that Reuters says shareholders are charging.Will borrowing costs drop?If we look at all the options in the series, we end up with the following chart showing the credit you’d “lock in” if you could short the stock –with both the net amount and the cost per day.It’s clear that traders are willing to accept less of a credit on a per day basis well into the future. And that could indicate that these “negative rebates” could get a lot less negative.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
307259,24432,2011-11-11T07:50:10-05:00,,"According to Bloomberg Businessweek, shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) are exceedingly difficult to borrow. There are few shares available at all, so it’s likely to be an expensive stock to short.How expensive? Bloomberg Businessweek says that the cost to borrow Groupon shares to short them “is rated a 10 by Data Explorers, the most-expensive level on the New York- based research firm’s scale.”I don’t know what “rated a 10” means in dollars and cents, but I do recall what LinkedIn (LNKD) shares cost to borrow soon after they began trading. As I noted back in May, CNBC contributor Jon Najarian reported fees of as much as 40 cents per day.That’s 40 cents. Per share. Per day.Well that was for an $80 stock, so maybe GRPN shares will only cost 10 cents a day to borrow. That’s still $300 per month to stay short 100 shares of the stock.Good news and bad newsBut I have good news. Options will soon be trading on GRPN, so now you can buy puts and avoid high borrowing costs.Unfortunately, there’s some bad news. There’s likely to be big huge premium on the puts as compared to the calls.Back in the first few weeks when LinkedIn options began trading, an at-the-money put cost up to twice as much money as the same strike call.So could you sell an at-the-money put, buy a call at the same strike – taking in a credit – and then short the stock to make that credit a guaranteed profit? Not likely. You probably would have found the cost of shorting the stock to be too high to make that trade worthwhile.But that volatility discrepancy did abate after a few weeks – perhaps as more shares became available to borrow.Here’s a look at the cost of a theoretical at-the-money call and put for LinkedIn expiring in 30 days – as a percentage of the price of the stock – and a chart of the ratio between the twoAt first, the puts cost way more than the calls, but as time went on, the puts began trading at less of a premium – possibly as the shares became easier to borrow.So if you’re planning to short Groupon through puts, keep an eye on those premiums as the puts may become less expensive after a few weeks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
307899,24205,2011-11-15T05:15:51-05:00,,"Launched in November 2008, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is the fastest firm to reach $2B in revenue in less than 2-3 years. Recently, it seems to be very fashionable for analysts to trash Groupon. The response of management was to propose that Groupon could follow the path of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) success. In the beginning of the 2000’s, Amazon skeptics said that Amazon ""could never make money,"" had ""no real competitive advantage,"" and was ""going to go bankrupt.""Amazon’s stock performance since IPOClick to enlarge Source: Yahoo FinanceAccording to Groupon supporters, Amazon had the same wonderful cash-flow engine that Groupon has, in that it gets paid by its customers long before it has to pay its suppliers. This cash-flow engine has allowed Groupon to grow spectacularly while consuming almost no capital, just the way Amazon once did.I will analyze the company in five sections: the good, the bad, the ugly, the challenges and the outlook.One important added value of group-buying coupons is that some small and medium businesses-- who could not afford a decent advertising budget-- can now advertise for a very small percentage of what it costs via print, radio or TV. Businesses not only have to offer deep discounts but also must give the daily deals websites a big chunk of those sales: A 50-50 split is typical.According to Brad Wilson, a discounts expert and founder of BradsDeals.com, the daily deals growth trend will survive the economic downturn, in part because consumers simply can't resist the allure of a bargain. ""There's such a compulsion to it …People end up spending more than they intended in the excitement of the countdown of that day.""Groupon had a successful IPO due to certain conditions: huge demand from institutional investors and a tiny float of public stock. High demand was, in part, because there has been a long-term shortage of high-profile stock offerings in the technology sector until very recently, when LinkedIn (LNKD) went public. Groupon offered just 4.7 percent of the total outstanding shares floated in the IPO, which is the smallest public float for any newly traded company in more than a decade (LinkedIn issued almost twice as much, at 8.6 percent, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) issued 7.2 percent of its stock).In a survey by Forrester Research:Living Social continues to nip at the heel of Groupon-- competition is intense. It is catching-up to Groupon in the number of unique visitors to its web site.Click to enlargeThere are more than 500 imitators with the same business model targeting national, regional and international markets. Most of them even have the same web site design as Groupon. It is very easy to copy the recipe of success of Groupon. The leader already has the first mover advantages-- having created a critical mass. Groupon has hundreds of salespeople finding new daily discounted group-buying deals, and is enjoying temporary winning conditions.For instance, when web advertising started to be implemented with high speed Internet, banner ads and video ads were very lucrative. Now with the proliferation of Internet advertising, these online ads are not so lucrative per click. When something is new, it is more appealing for a large segment of consumers. Another example is the success of virtual goods sold in online video games. Who wants to buy a virtual good? I don't understand why a human being would do this, but 6% of the customers of online games acquired $640 million worth in 2010. I'm not sure this is a sustainable trend, but it is new and appealing for a segment of the population so far.Concerns over the business modelSince it has to win over new customers in order to keep its email coupon business growing, Groupon spends hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing. As a result it has been losing tens of millions of dollars and operating with negative cash flow. In its “roadshow” presentation to potential investors before the IPO, Mason and other senior executives of the company argued that Groupon is similar to Amazon, which was also criticized for spending heavily and not being profitable and now has a market value of $98 billion. But many analysts are skeptical of this comparison as well, because Groupon’s model involves far higher marketing costs and generates what appears to be a much lower profit margin on every sale. Unless the company can boost the value of those sales by adding other things (which some have argued that it can) or reduce its costs dramatically, it doesn’t look like a business with long-term growth prospects.Thus, Groupon still loses money. Revenue growth is flat, the company's accounting practices have been questioned (and revamped), the company apparently violated ""quiet period"" rules, and COO Margo Georgiadis abruptly left the company to work for Google after just five months.In a recent report, Forrester’s biggest dig on the space is that it has created “deal-hunting gremlins,” who are getting a discount on services they would normally be willing to pay full price for. Additionally, analyst Sucharita Mulpuru finds that the daily email model is expensive to scale and that consumers will ultimately unsubscribe as offers fill up their inboxes.Forrester’s survey findings:Lessons from the 2001 tech crash and the recoveryThe tech firms which passed through the deep recession of 2001-2002 were the ones with strong business models. Amazon, with its e-commerce powerhouse, evolved into a cloud-computing powerhouse with high digital sales. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) prospered as an electronic exchange. Pets.com went bankrupt with no decent business model. Several telecoms Competitive Exchange Locals Carriers (CLEC) went bankrupt in North America because they had a me-too business model with no real strategic sustainable advantage. The same thing is happening right now with ""me-too"" Groupon competitors. To a certain extent, it will also affect Groupon’s valuation and its business model.Amazon was hated in the late 1990s. Many smart people thought Amazon could never make money and was going to go broke. Many analysts were convinced that the company had no competitive advantage. Now Amazon has a $100 billion market cap and is the global leader in ecommerce. According to Blodget of Business Insider, the real problem with the Amazon-Groupon comparison is this:In one study, 82% of retailers running a Groupon promotion were “Unsatisfied with the Level of Repeat Business.” People will come to a new store — any store — for a really good deal, but that does not mean they become devoted customers. One could argue that’s the merchant’s fault. What are they doing around the deal to bring people back?  More fundamentally, Groupon's prospects are far from predictable. There have been complaints from business owners that online coupons lose them money (which is sort of the point) but don't bring coupon users back to buy at full price (which is supposed to be the point.) Further, there are few barriers to entry in Groupon's business, which means that it must rely heavily on branding, even as competitors pile in.According to Stuart Wall of Signpost, the company is spending $2.3M a day on consumer marketing – roughly twice as much as Target (NYSE:TGT). Every day some percentage of Groupon’s existing subscribers turn off their newsletter, subscribe to a competitor, or stop making purchases all together. Groupon spent around $5.65 for every new subscriber it acquired in 2011, a 152% increase from the price paid in the first quarter of 2010. At this rate Groupon would now be paying over $7. Why the huge increase? As hundreds of Groupon clones began to compete with Groupon for the same consumers, advertising became more expensive and less effective.The challengesCEO Mason says the company will be able to reduce marketing costs to virtually nothing over time while continuing to generate revenue from the customers on its email lists, but there’s a lot of skepticism about whether that’s true. The company has been adding new products-- such as Groupon Now and a Groupon travel offering-- to try to boost the amount of money it makes from each user, but results from markets in which it has been operating for some time seem to show that the value of a user drops off fairly dramatically the longer they’ve been a Groupon member.Daily Deal marketers use three assumptions to calculate each consumer’s lifetime value:According to Stuart of Signpost, plug these numbers into a Google Spreadsheet and you get a lifetime value of $4.86 for Q1 ’11, a 64 percent decline from Q2 ‘09. Insiders refer to declining lifetime values as the ‘tragedy of the commons’: the value of an inbox depreciates each time a subscribers adds a competing service. Groupon’s most active consumers now get five to ten daily emails from a competitor.Groupon believes the lifetime customer value is much higher, as it is likely to profit off each subscriber long after the year they were acquired.Click to enlarge SourceThe resulting CPA vs. lifetime value chart is something Groupon is unlikely to bring to its road show. Groupon is on track to earn a negative 52 percent return on every dollar they spend on email marketing in Q3 2011.According to Stuart, Groupon’s aggressive marketing spending is driven by a combination of three factors:Stuart’s assumptions: Discount rate of 9.8 percent based on a WACC analysis of comparable companies listed in its S1. Subscribers decrease average purchase rate by .093 percent daily based on Groupon’s average lifetime purchase decline.Groupon’s core local deals business declined in the most recent quarter. Groupon grew 8% in North American from Q2 to Q3 because of these new products, but its core local deals business actually dropped 3%.A key challenge is to extract more money from existing customers. A more interactive experience with SoLoMo is a solution. We will discuss more later.The outlookAccording to Blodget of Business insider:According to Don Rainey, a partner with Grotech Ventures and an investor in LivingSocial:Rainey said he sees a day when merchants and potential customers interact through a kind of real-time exchange — like a stock exchange, with buyers and sellers, but for local offers on meals or other goods. “I can see local retailers and consumers bidding in a real-time system for where that consumer is going to go for dinner,” says Rainey. If a merchant is having a slow night, it can put an offer into the system and users can choose between that and multiple other offers, based on location and the time they want to go out. As someone who is constantly looking for new options for places to eat in my local area, this sounds like a winner to me.With all that good will and capital, Groupon may hit upon one or more strategies adjacent to or outside of deals that make it a lasting success. If it is similar to Amazon, it will face a severe correction, and with fine-tuning of the business models it could recover. Will it be like Amazon’s value creation? It is too soon to make a judgment. On the long term, its team of A list stars (mainly from Amazon), will have to adapt the business model to increased competition, and leverage new technologies such as SoLoMo.Search engines for daily deals can act as brokers and find infomediation opportunities (see my previous article). Thus, by exchanging information on its profile and personal preferences on consuming habits, consumers could find better daily deals tailored to their real needs. Daily mobile alerts-- which can be personalized to customers-- would bring value added to both consumers who can make targeted very interesting deals, and retailers who can reach more ""offers-friendly"" customers. Geolocalisation combined with SoLoMo, (the intersection between Social networks, Local commerce and Mobile) can be very lucrative in the future for Groupon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
307629,21863,2011-11-14T08:15:26-05:00,,"Value investors should stay away from IPOs  for a plethora of reasons. Rarely are those reasons so well exemplified  as they were in the case of Groupon's IPO (NASDAQ:GRPN), which occurred about two  weeks ago.Groupon is the well-known daily deal advertiser that has generated  strong consumer interest. But its lack of profits and short history make  it very difficult to value. Since value investors like to buy at a  discount to intrinsic value, the determination of a reasonable range for  a company's intrinsic value is crucial. But that doesn't appear  possible in this case.Groupon doesn't make money, and has only been around for four or five  years. Coming up with an intrinsic value for this company is an exercise  in futility (though this won't stop even value-oriented people from trying),  involving a number of assumptions about growth, margins etc. that are  more likely to provide the investor with a false sense of confidence  than an accurate valuation.Further complicating this IPO process is that it appears to be a  marketing ploy on the part of the company. Groupon only issued about 5%  of its outstanding shares as part of the IPO, which appears to be an  attempt to limit supply. At the same time, it offered these shares at a  price that would be attractive to buyers, creating a huge pop on its  first day of trading. In so doing, such an issue can appear like a  winner and thereby attract speculators who like to buy stocks that show  positive momentum. This way, the company will be able to issue more  shares at a better price later.This is not the type of game in which the value investor should participate!Disclosure: No position"
307943,24710,2011-11-15T08:47:28-05:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is the worldwide leader in so-called 'daily deals'. The company offers consumers the opportunity to purchase daily coupons that entitle them to discounts at participating merchants. Groupon collects money from customers for the coupons, keeps around half of the total, and disperses the rest to the merchant. Specifically, Groupon's ""revenue is the purchase price paid by the customer for the Groupon less an agreed upon percentage of the purchase price paid to the featured merchant"".The company went public on November 4, placing 35 million shares at $20 each, well above the target range of $16-18 per share. On the first day it was available to the public, the stock traded up better than 50% intraday before closing up 31% to $26.11.  Since then, the stock has cooled off a bit and now trades around $24 per share.In a previous article, I recommended buying Groupon's shares as close to the IPO price as possible and selling immediately into the rally. If you were lucky enough to get in early and you haven't sold your shares yet, it might be time to start unloading them. While many investors were skeptical of Groupon's business model early-on, reasons for not liking the company (as an investment that is) just keep piling up.Before going into some of the reasons why you should not buy Groupon's stock, it is worth mentioning that the 'demand' for Groupon's shares on the first day was artificial. Groupon's 5.5% share float is the second smallest of any IPO in the past ten years. This is a clear example of creating demand for something by artificially constraining supply.Having said that, it should be noted that despite the company's awe-inspiring growth record, Groupon has never actually made a dime of profit. The company has lost $633 million this year as of September 30. In its prospectus, the company says the following: ""...we have incurred net losses since inception and we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly into the near future."" In other words, ""our business model is clearly not conducive to profit generation and we expect rising costs to make it even more difficult for us to climb out of the hole.""Make no mistake, the company is burning through cash in an effort to recruit new customers. Groupon has spent $466 million this year on marketing in an attempt to lure in new subscribers. In a rather alarming passage from the prospectus, the company notes that it ""cannot assure [investors] that the revenue from subscribers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring new subscribers"". This means the company is slowly drowning. This is especially scary given that only about 25% of Groupon's subscribers have actually purchased a coupon from the site.In its prospectus, the company also notes that ""if we fail to retain existing merchants or add new merchants, our revenue and business will be harmed"". This statement could be written-off as simply a cautionary reminder to prospective investors were it not for the fact that Groupon is already losing business due to the company's reluctance (or inability) to pay participating merchants their part of the deal price.As it turns out, Groupon pays merchants in three installments over 60 days. Compare this to the payment policies of the company's competitors and it is difficult to imagine why any merchant would choose Groupon. Amazon Local (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Living Social pay merchants 100% of what they are owed within two weeks while Google Offers (NASDAQ:GOOG) pays participating businesses 80% within four days and the remaining 20% within three months.A recent Wall Street Journal article entitled ""Groupon Holds Cash Tight"" provides numerous first hand accounts from merchants who are dissatisfied with the way Groupon disperses payments. As the article notes, keeping cash on its books instead of turning it over immediately to merchants makes Groupon's cash position look better than it actually is. Apparently, this is typical behavior for the company. Groupon is notorious for reporting the full amount of coupons purchased by subscribers as 'revenue' as though it did not have to turn over a percentage of the profit to merchants at all. Even more disturbing is the fact that the percentage of each deal that Groupon does get to keep is falling fast.Additionally, it should be noted that Groupon owes merchants more than it has in cash - that is, if asked to pay merchants what it owes them in one lump payment, the company could not do so. The whole thing looks eerily similar to a ponzi scheme. Red flags also abound regarding the company's accounting practices, most notably:The good news for traders is that Groupon options began trading on Monday. Apparently, more investors are betting on Groupon to fall than rise as 7,000 puts traded hands against only 5,500 calls. I believe Groupon's stock will eventually fall below $5 per share. The company will likely lose in excess of $700 million (ironically the total it raised in its IPO) this year and it does not even have enough cash on its books to pay merchants their half of the deals it sells.All this at a company where the CEO is now worth $1.2 billion - there's something wrong with that. Now is the time to either short these shares or buy some put options on the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN over the next 72 hours."

So  despite the major macro risks in play, institutional investors are  willing to allocate capital to promising companies that have yet to actually turn a profit.  This is a pretty bullish indicator (at least for the short-term).On the other hand, bearish investors can point to the fact that the  IPO transaction was effectively engineered so that the stock price would  rise on the first day of trading.  An intentionally low share count,  and a very attractive offering price, created a natural environment for a  “successful launch.”According to a Wall Street Journal article, the Groupon management team was intimately involved in the decision of who  received the initial shares.  Allocations were primarily given to large  mutual fund managers “who appeared to understand the story in  one-on-one meetings with Groupon executives during the nine-day  roadshow.”So while most road shows are offered with the intention of drumming up interest in an IPO offering, this  particular road show appears to have been for the purpose of Groupon  executives to identify the best prospective INVESTORS for their stock.Now that the shares are being actively traded, we’re watching the  stock to determine where trading opportunities will emerge.  While the  first day of trading was definitely a bullish event, I see three significant challenges that Groupon will have to overcome for the stock to be attractive for long-term investors.1) Competitive ChallengesGroupon’s growth strategy has been successful because of the company’s ability to rapidly expand their geographic market share …Each time Groupon enters a new city, their sales staff blankets the  metro area – reaching out to business owners with the gospel of “social  media marketing.”  By expanding to new cities, Groupon is able to  increase their user base, their merchant count, and by extension their  revenue base.But while the headline growth looks very attractive to investors, the devil is in the details.One particular way that Google and other competitors could undercut  Groupon is by offering merchants payouts that are distributed quickly.   According to a recent Bloomberg article, Groupon “owed almost twice as much to merchants at the end of September as it held in cash.”Of course Groupon’s cash balance is now much higher after the IPO  offering, but if GRPN decides to become more attractive to vendors by  offering more prompt payouts, it could have a material effect on the  company’s working capital.2) Share DilutionOne of the ways that Groupon engineered a successful IPO offering is  by offering only a tiny portion of the company to investors.  We’re  still waiting on the final tally (after accounting for underwriters  over-allotments etc.) but it appears that GRPN only offered 6.3% of the  company in this first transaction.The relative scarcity of shares makes this a highly sought after  issue.  If you are a mutual fund manager and want to take part in this  growth opportunity, you will be competing with dozens of other managers  to get exposure right now.  The high demand and low supply has naturally  pushed the stock price higher.But this “artificial scarcity” isn’t likely to last.  As GRPN  continues to enter more markets and beefs up its marketing staff, it  will likely continue to need to tap equity markets.  (Remember, the company is still operating at a loss – so they are burning through cash on a monthly basis).Perhaps more importantly, we have the issue of stock held by  executives and employees.  These shares will be “locked up” until  sometime in May – so they don’t represent an immediate danger to current  investors.  But if GRPN continues to sport a hefty valuation when these  shares become available for sale, there will be a major temptation for  employees to cash in on their new-found wealth.As more shares flood the market (either directly or through secondary  offerings) the relative scarcity of shares available will dissipate –  and GRPN will begin to trade more in-line with fundamental valuations…  By  the way, it’s extremely difficult to “fundamentally value” a company  that generates negative earnings for the foreseeable future.Bottom line: Groupon’s share price is currently influenced by a  relatively low number of available shares.  As this changes, its easy to  make an argument for a significantly lower stock price3) New options for “Social Media” InvestingOne  of the reasons demand for GRPN stock has been so high, is because GRPN  is one of the few available options for investing in the new generation  of “social media” companies.  The other major publicly traded companies  in this area are LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) and Pandora Media Inc. (NYSE:P).One possible addition couldbe Renren Inc. (NYSE:RENN),  but so far investors have been extremely disappointed in the “Chinese  version of Facebook.”  Investors have a number of reasons to be wary of  Chinese investments traded on US exchanges – from economic uncertainty  in China, to regulatory risks, to censorship issues facing all social  media sites in China.With relatively few “social media” companies available for trading,  there is an imbalance between supply and demand.  Investors want to be  participating in this hot area of the economy, but they are limited in  the number of “investment quality” companies they can trade.In the next few months, we are likely to see shares of Zynga become available for traders – and the mother of all social media companies – Facebook Inc. -  will likely offer shares early next year.  As new offerings increase  the number of choices for “social media” investing, mutual fund  managers, as well as individual investors will likely migrate towards  the participants that are actually generating profits.Patiently Stalking a TradeThe key to profitable trading is to have patience while a situation  develops.  At this point, we don’t have any short exposure to social  media stocks.  Groupon’s successful IPO just goes to underscore the  currently willingness of investors to buy into growth opportunities.But as we track overall market sentiment – the willingness of  investors to accept risk and pursue growth – as well as the technical  patterns for individual sectors, we will be identifying support and  resistance areas for social media stocks.The current market has plenty of uncertainty – and social media  companies offer more questions than answers right now.  But in time,  there should be a number of very attractive trade setups for patient  bulls in waiting.Disclosure: As active traders, authors may  have positions long or short in any securities mentioned.

The total shares  traded Friday were 142% of those issued — meaning on average every  share was sold once and 40% of shares were sold twice. Presumably some  of that comes from the “greenshoe” of the offering bankers flipping their shares in addition to their $50 million in fees.Groupon now has a market cap of over $16 billion.In its S-1, Groupon claims competition is not an issue:Normally, we’d wonder how much the shares will fall after the other 96% come out of lockup. However, insiders have already dumped $943 million in shares after  capturing 84% of the VC proceeds. So perhaps the large insiders will be  patient, holding out for a higher price in the long run.Or maybe there is no long run. The company lost money for the last four  quarters, and by some measures it was technically insolvency before the  IPO. As Villanova business professor Anthony Catanachtold CNBC:Wikipedia tells us that 1637, a single tulip bulb sold for 10x average annual wages. A century ago, philosopher George Santayana said: “Those  who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Nowadays, few  philosophers make it to Wall Street, let alone invest in the market,  which is why the “wisdom of crowds” is often the “madness of crowds.”"

The offering was  priced at $20 and experienced an exuberant opening pop of $28, which  after a day of trading settled down a bit to close at $26.While Groupon’s co-founders and high-level executives notoriously took hundreds of millions off  the table in an earlier round of funding, they still had notable skin  in the game today, as evidenced by the share allocation on Groupon’s latest S-1. Biggest winner? Lightbank founder Eric Lefkosky, who is now a billionaire three times over with a solid 28.1% voting share. CEO Andrew Mason, by comparison, is now worth $1.2 billion in Groupon stock.VC firm Accel Partners  and the Samwer brothers are also in enviable positions post IPO, each  netting about a billion in Groupon equity for their troubles. It’s  probably safe to say that just about everyone on this list is on a  customary six month lockout with regards to selling their shares, and  God only knows what the stock will be trading at then.Original post"
305789,24764,2011-11-07T06:06:48-05:00,,"Negativity is hitting Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), with many people questioning the company's business model once again. Groupon went under such a heavy attack of negativity during its quiet period that the company opted to delay its IPO. Groupon has been a perfect candidate for negative articles due to several missteps the company took on the road to going public. First, the company used Non-GAAP accounting in its prospectus. The company was trying to show analysts its profitability without certain marketing expenses.Groupon CEO Andrew Mason then made the mistake of indirectly responding to the criticism which violated the company's quiet period. These mistakes definitely shows the inexperience in the company's founder in how to properly go public but I don't view these mistakes as a reason to now turn bearish on the whole company.What interests me about this situation is all the negative news that is being brought up by analysts. Analysts have concerns regarding Groupon's losses. Groupon has always invested heavily in customer acquisition and marketing. In fact Groupon has incurred net losses since its inception. Groupon spent over $179 million in the first quarter of 2011 on online marketing. This investment caused Groupon to lose $102 million in the first quarter of 2011. The fact is that Groupon is just such an easy target for negative press.Here are some points I like about Groupon:The analysis by Wall Street is based on a belief that the company must spend these marketing dollars in order to sustain its business. I have the opposite view:Groupon doesn't need to make this investment in order to stay in business, it does it for strategic purposes. Groupon does need to invest heavily to maintain this type of fast growth. For anyone to assume that Groupon can sustain its revenue growth of over 2,000% for a long period of time is ludicrous. Especially if you believe you could do it without spending any money.Analysts like to use Groupon's declining revenue per subscriber as a sign that the business model is doomed. You can't assume that the revenue per subscriber remains at a static number as the company grows subscribers at such a rapid pace. It's a simple thing called the Law of Large Numbers.Groupon's revenue growth has beat that of even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) when comparing the first two years of growth. You can read more about that here. I believe that Groupon's growth will eventually taper off but not until it has grown its subscriber base to a much larger size worldwide.Groupon is trying to play on its first mover advantage. Being the daily discount leader, many merchants and customers are flocking to Groupon. By quickly expanding into new markets the company can look to maintain that advantage. I expect Groupon to substantially minimize its marketing expenses when the growth slows down. This would put Groupon in a very nice position to generate profits for its investors.I like the fact that Groupon has a small float as well. Groupon has only about 5% of its stock trading. A small float makes Groupon prime for a sharp rally once investors realize that negativity on Groupon is overblown.I'm bullish on Groupon but would wait for the pullback to purchase. I'm hoping for the negativity to continue so I could buy shares much cheaper. I wouldn't be surprised for Groupon to test the support in the $20 area which is the same price as the offering for IPO investors. I would like to make my first buy in that $20 area if I can get it. If I get a buy signal before the $20 price I will still take it. Many investment banks often buy heavy at IPO offering prices in order to please IPO investors. After all, how happy would you be if you just bought an IPO that quickly went underwater.Groupon is setting up to reward investors that buy into the next sell-off. I'm expecting to play the same moves that occurred in previous IPO stocks that I played.Click charts to enlarge:The green arrow marks my purchase on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) following the company's IPO. I got a nice consolidation breakout on this buy. I marked my sell area with a red arrow.I marked my purchase on LinkedIn (LNKD) with a green arrow. I got a nice Doji buy signal on this purchase.

305896,24408,2011-11-07T13:18:12-05:00,,"As is the case with most IPOs, investors who have managed to purchase shares of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) in the pre-IPO market have hit the jackpot, as the stock soared more than 40% at the opening. The problem, however, is that pre-IPO prices are usually reserved for the select few institutional investors who have access to underwriters. This means that the retail investor can get into the game only at the after-market prices. But on which side of the market? Long on short?Most followers of the stock believe that investors should get on the short side of the market, as the success of the IPO seems to be part of the social media craze rather than a reflection of the company’s fundamentals. Specifically, the company doesn’t have a sustainable business model. It relies heavily on agreements with local merchants willing to offer their products at a deep discount; and on consumers spreading the buzz about the deal over the Internet. The company further faces stiff competition from the Internet gorillas like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) that have the database and the network infrastructure to come up with similar offers. The company also faces competition from smaller web-based companies like Open Table (NASDAQ:OPEN) that have been enjoying a “first-mover advantage,” and yet they aren’t doing terribly well.Going short, however, this early isn’t a good idea. But there is a better trade idea investors may want to consider: Short web-based companies with shaky fundamentals like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Open Table that had a big run up going into the IPO.Click to enlargeDisclosure: I am short NFLX."
305724,24970,2011-11-06T09:02:04-05:00,,"Groupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) growth is a direct result of its marketing expenses. Year to date, Groupon has spent $600 million of its $1.12 billion net revenue on marketing, nearly 50% of its revenue. The subscriber growth is a direct result of Groupon’s marketing expense. Its 2009 marketing expense was $4.6 million and ballooned 45 times to $208 million in Q1 2011; in the same period, the number of subscribers grew in almost exactly the same proportion, from 1.8 million to 83 million.This trend actually shows that it is increasingly expensive to acquire new customers as these marketing expenses are recurring but the number of subscribers is cumulative. If the marginal cost of attracting new customers is increasing, it would seem that Groupon can only grow if per subscriber spending increases, but the information in its prospectus shows otherwise.In the prospectus, Groupon showcased four cities with the numbers of subscribers and revenue for each city. The trend is actually really disturbing (see chart below, click to enlarge). The revenue per subscriber is plummeting in the US and flat in Berlin and London; if that’s what is happening with its showcase cities, I can’t imagine how other cities are faring.Conclusion The current model of Groupon is not sustainable; it will soon reach a point where the cost to acquire new subscribers will be significantly higher than what the subscribers are worth. At that point, Groupon’s subscriber growth rate will plummet and it will have to find another story to justify its $13 billion valuation. With only 5% of its shares available for trading, the stock price will be skewed to the upside until the unlock period comes 6 months later. I recommend shorting the stock a month before the unlock period.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
305701,23374,2011-11-06T07:43:23-05:00,,"By David BermanGroupon Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) debut on the Nasdaq shows that there's still an appetite for intriguing yet unprofitable Internet-related companies: Within the first hour of trading, the shares jumped nearly 56 per cent – though the enthusiasm has since subsided a little.And what makes this debut even more impressive is that the shares were priced at $20 (each, considerably higher than the $16 to $18 range that the company had originally been looking for. This implies that there’s already a lot of optimism priced in. The starting price valued Groupon at an amazing $12.7-billion; the share price gain implies a value of nearly $20-billion. Consider that Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) tried to buy the company at just $6-billion a year ago.Oh, and don’t forget about the backdrop: Groupon’s early surge comes as the S&P 500 slumps about 1.4 per cent on Friday over concerns about the U.S. economy, Europe and just about everything else. In other words, Groupon isn’t launching into a raging bull market – and yet it is still doing just fine.The narrow slice of ownership might be helping the company: Groupon’s initial public offering made just 4.7 per cent of the company available to the public – the lowest ownership slice for an Internet company since at least 2000, according to Bloomberg News. Scarcity seems to be working in its favour.Just don’t expect a smooth ride here. LinkedIn Corp.(LNKD) made a similar splash when it went public in the middle of May. It more than doubled on its first day of trading, but since then it has endured about 30 days in which the stock has risen or fallen by 5 per cent or more. Count Friday among them: The shares fell 9.1 per cent in late morning trading."
305688,22119,2011-11-06T07:09:51-05:00,,"The animal spirits have welcomed Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) to the public markets, with a  successful initial public offering that values the company at a hefty  $16 billion or so. That's a much frothier start than other recent IPOs  such as LinkedIn (LNKD) or Pandora (NYSE:P).Once the initial buzz wears off, however, Groupon will have to prove   that its business model is sustainable in a convulsive retail   environment that's being transformed by technology and a Darwinian   economy. It may also have to face down some of the giants of retail,   such as online powerhouse Amazon and perhaps even Google. Many   investors, in fact, believe that Groupon's soaring stock-market   opening—with a share price that started at $20 and spiked above $30 for a   while—will be the high-water mark for the company, with a quick fade   inevitable.Groupon and its founder and CEO, Andrew Mason, certainly deserve   credit for devising a new retail wrinkle and for rapidly turning the   idea into an international business. Millions of Americans have already   purchased the kind of daily-deal coupon that Groupon originated, saving  50 percent or more on goods or  services once they redeem the voucher at a  local merchant. Since Mason  started Groupon in Chicago just three years  ago, it has swelled to a  company with 7,000 employees, operating in  more than 40 countries.  That's the kind of ""job creator"" the U.S.  economy desperately needs.Whether Groupon can sustain those jobs is another question. The   company's business depends on merchants who are willing to offer deep   discounts on food, clothing, spa services, dental work, and everything   else local businesses offer, as way of getting new customers in the   door. So far, the scheme has worked, even though some businesses lose   money on the deals and aren't sure they'll ever make up the difference  by turning  deal-seekers into return customers willing to pay regular  prices. There  are clearly some factors in Groupon's favor. A recent  study by  consulting firm Accenture found that fewer than half of all  U.S.  consumers have used daily-deal sites so far, so there's still a  large  untapped market. Groupon also has a head start on competitors,  with a  bigger list of existing customers (and their E-mail addresses)  and  better brand recognition than other deal sites.But there are several reasons that Groupon's early success might be a temporary phenomenon. Here are four:Low barriers to entry. Groupon's success has spawned many other deal sites, such as Living Social, LevelUp, Mogl, and hundreds of smaller outfits. By one estimate,   in fact, more than 500 daily-deal sites have sprung up over the last   couple of years, some of them already out of business. Groupon is the   biggest so far, and it has first-mover advantage. The question is   whether that will count for much in the longer term.In some businesses, being first to market establishes a huge edge   that can last for years, especially if the business relies on a new   design or idea backed by proprietary technology, such as the iPad or the   Mini Cooper. It's also hard to copy physical infrastructure that takes   time and money to build. Netflix, for example, milked its first-mover   advantage for a decade before competitors caught up to its DVD   distribution system and came up with better ideas, such as renting   movies out of vending machines at retail stores.It's a lot easier for competitors to copy Groupon's model, since all   it really takes is a sales force canvassing local businesses and a   promotional campaign that will attract customers to the deals.   Competition will cut into Groupon's market share and force it to offer   better terms to merchants, lowering profitability. It may also exhaust   merchants, who tire of the onslaught of deal chasers and dial back, at   some point leaving less business to be split among more deal purveyors.   To succeed, Groupon will have to keep outsmarting competitors and   finding new ways to reach customers. ""If they rest on their laurels or   try to rely on the sizzle of the idea,"" says Tom Jacobson of Accenture,   ""they'll probably end up in the same place as anybody else who doesn't   innovate."" In other words, think Borders or Blockbuster.Middlemen. Businesses who offer deals through   Groupon or a competitor are paying a fairly high price. Most of them are   willing to lose money on the deal itself, because they're paying for a   promotional campaign they don't have the staff, budget, or expertise  to  handle in-house. But businesses might be able to get a better deal   themselves. New companies such as Stampede   offer to act as an agent helping merchants negotiate better terms with   the deal sites—another trend that will lower profitability for  Groupon,  et al.On the consumer side, sites such as Yipit   monitor dozens of deal sites and send consumers the offers that are   likely to be most appealing, based on their personal interests. That   seems likely to further erode Groupon's first-mover advantage. While   Groupon may have brand recognition, there's no evidence that its   customers are loyal to the brand, especially since they tend to be   price-sensitive by nature. So consumers seem likely to chase the best   deals, from any site, rather than stick with one deal merchant.The ""decay function."" Blogger James Kwak   argues that Groupon's existing customer base—which the company touts  as  one of its most valuable assets—could end up being worth far less  than  the company claims. By analyzing Groupon's own data, Kwak  estimates that  customers who have purchased a coupon in the past and  are already in  the fold may end up spending less money on Groupon in  the future, as  they try out competing deals or simply lose interest.  This ""decay  function"" might level off at a point that allows Groupon to  remain  profitable. But it could also keep falling, which would force  Groupon to  spend a lot more on marketing to continually bring in new  customers.  That would be a costly and perhaps devastating blow to  Groupon's  business model, which relies on existing customers to keep  spending.Another big, unanswered question is whether the novelty of daily   deals will wear off. The Accenture study shows that daily deals remain   popular, but it also highlights some weaknesses of the whole concept.   Significant numbers of people who belong to a deal site feel they get   too many E-mails, and too many offers for things they're not interested   in. That problem could get worse as deal sites proliferate. And   participants on average redeem barely half of the deals they've paid   for, which means many people may not be saving anything at all, on the   whole. If enough consumers do the math and decide such deals aren't   worth it, the entire trend could suddenly stagnate.Overdependence on physical stores. For now,   Groupon-style deals are targeted at the most vulnerable part of the   retail establishment: local stores. Groupon is aggressively pursuing a   mobile strategy—known as Groupon Now—which allows shoppers to download   coupons onto a mobile device and find real-time deals wherever they   happen to be shopping.  That's a smart play meant to capitalize on what  looks like the next  big trend in shopping. But guess who else plans to  capitalize on that  trend: Google, which has its own smartphone platform,  a near-monopoly  on Web advertising and more money than all daily-deal  sites combined  will probably earn over the next decade.Since brick-and-mortar stores are consistently losing ground to   online shopping sites, Groupon's long-term profitability depends heavily   on its ability to find a niche among the biggest names in E-commerce.   That includes Amazon, which just rolled out a low-priced tablet device   meant to steer shoppers to its website for many of the things they once   traveled to stores to purchase. Then there are huge hybrid retailers   like Target and Wal-Mart, which have a strong presence in both the   physical and digital marketplace and seem to have no need for   deal-packagers like Groupon.Maybe Groupon's startup mentality will keep it a step or two ahead of   the lumbering giants, and even help local merchants find a way to   expand their business online. But there have been hundreds of scrappy   businesses that buzzed triumphantly under the nose of the Goliaths for a   while—before getting squashed. Groupon has a long way to go to prove   it's not one of them.Disclosure: No positions"
305502,21369,2011-11-04T17:48:57-04:00,,"By David UraniIf you needed any more proof that we live in an Internet-crazed age,  look no further than today's IPO of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). If you're not  familiar with it, in a nutshell it offers daily coupons for group  discounts at local businesses near you. Today's deal in New York is a  $39 meal for two at a fancy French restaurant. Needless to say, it got  really popular really fast and now it's one of the hottest IPOs of  2011. The IPO was initially priced with a market cap of a little over  $12 billion, and initial trading has the stock up about 40%, so that  gives it a market value of about $17 billion as I write this.I am part of the tech generation, and I regularly watch my friends  and peers get way too excited about cellphones, Facebook and the like.  In a way, you might call me techno-phobic. Nevertheless, I am probably  an outlier these days and the market, like most people, certainly goes  into a frenzy when a hot new tech fad comes around. Perhaps I am biased  against Internet fads, but I like to think I am seeing things from all  angles and at this price, I think Groupon is grossly overvalued.Sure, Groupon is super popular right now, but the way I see it there  is nothing groundbreaking there. I don't know the intricacies of its  daily operations, but from the outside it looks to me like running its  daily deals takes little more than a phone call to local businesses to  set up a discount deal. In that sense, it looks easy to replicate.Not only that, but the hype already seems to be wearing off for  Groupon. The company has slowed from 111% revenue growth in late 2010 to  10% last quarter. That could be a function of the ""viral"" couponing  frenzy growing stale, and as I said before its model can be replicated;  take Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) for instance, which set up its own daily local  deal section just like Groupon. GRPN's revenue is expected to be $1.7  billion this year, while it is approximately breakeven profit-wise. It  employs 7,000.I scoured the market for some other market caps just under $17  billion and found the following among others: H.J. Heinz (HNZ),  Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Raytheon (RTN), Transocean (NYSE:RIG). Of course  you know Heinz, because its ketchup is in just about every restaurant  you've ever been to and in your fridge as well. It started making its ketchup in 1869. It also makes Classico, Lea & Perrins, Ore-Ida and  several other brands. It employs more than 30,000 people in 19 factories  and generates more than $10 billion revenue annually.Raytheon employs highly respectable scientists and engineering talent  to make products that give the U.S. military some of the capabilities  that no other nations have. Take for instance the Tomahawk cruise  missile, a $569,000, 3,500 lb. mechanical marvel that can travel 1,550  miles and can be programmed to fly to up to 15 pre-programmed  destinations while maintaining a stable low-altitude trajectory and  following the earth's topography at 550 mph, with accuracy within 10  meters. If you are another company trying to replicate Raytheon's  business, good luck. It generates $25 billion of revenue annually and  employs 72,000.Of course, the current value of Groupon anticipates it growing to  the size and stature of the likes of Heinz and Raytheon, but it's got a  long way to go and as I said the hype might already be wearing off. And  I don't see any groundbreaking innovations or nationwide brand loyalty  that has lasted 142 years. Again, you could call me an e-skeptic but  this is starting to smell a little bit like tech bubble 2.0."
305542,24714,2011-11-04T21:53:19-04:00,,"A lot of value investors, like me, believe that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is extremely overvalued at its current price. However, I wouldn’t be so fast to short shares right after they closed at $26.11 on Friday. Unfortunately, the stock market isn’t perfectly efficient all of the time and Groupon could trade even higher over the next week. In this article, I shed some insight on why bears should wait to go short.Groupon is valued at $16.6 billion after its first day of trading. Only about $700 million of the company was sold during the IPO, and I believe its very successful first day was driven mostly from supply and demand. Investors want in on new tech stocks, and this is only the third major IPO of the new age tech companies, with the other two being LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE:P). LinkedIn's IPO was very similar to Groupon's in that shares traded much higher than the IPO price. LinkedIn's was more extreme, trading above $90 when the IPO price was only $45. Pandora didn't see this jump, as shares traded below the $16 IPO price in the first few weeks of trading.The big lesson that investors should take away from the first tech bubble, LinkedIn's IPO, and Pandora's IPO is that it takes a very long time until shares will fall off the table to levels that us value investors would call ""fair"". Pandora still trades at $15.22 and has seen great performance since its drop to $9.33 in September. LinkedIn still trades above $80, even after its earnings report that drop its price by almost 6 percent on Friday. Many investors who shorted tech stocks during the initial tech bubble were not able to reap the benefits of being right as they had to close their positions because they could not meet their margin calls. Bearish investors should not make the same mistakes with Groupon. With some mutual funds earnings huge gains on their investments in Groupon, the bullish activity may continue.The one thing I'm sure of with Groupon stock is that it will be volatile. With so many accounting questions and such an unproven business model, I'm very confident that 10 percent swings in the stock over a day of trading will not be uncommon. One play I suggest the bears consider is speculating on Groupon stock volatility with options. Options for Groupon are expected to start selling around November 14th. Purchasing a put and a call of Groupon can protect an investor against the stock continuing to skyrocket, but also yields a high return if the bubble bursts early. Although I'm sure options will be expensive since Groupon volatility is expected by most, it may still be a good investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The business model is almost  like consumers forming a union to buy in bulk – purchasing power in  numbers.But good companies and sound stock investments aren’t built on brand recognition or contributions to society.For example, take a gander over at Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK).  Kodak revolutionized the way people captured memories. But poor  leadership and lack of adaptability nearly eradicated them. All that’s  left is essentially a pile of patents.But is Groupon’s IPO a buy-low opportunity on a rising star in the  social media craze? Or is it a black hole of cash that can’t survive?The Good NewsThere’s a reason Groupon has reportedly called off taking IPO orders a day earlier than expected. Some investors can’t wait to get their hands on the stock. Here are a few reasons why they may be bullish:And the Bad NewsThe Rap on IPOs In GeneralHere are a few things to keep in mind about IPOs in general, which also apply to Groupon’s.Bottom Line for Groupon’s IPOGroupon’s long-term prospects don’t look very positive. Most analysts  don’t trust the stock, and they’re right to be cautious of the  unusually small float. But the sentiment is so negative that investors  may be too far down on its stock.But the report that demand is high for its pre orders seems to spell  over exuberance. Plus, history tells us that the IPO pop never lasts.  And Travelzoo (Nasdaq: TZOO), which is overpriced, is probably still a better value at this point than Groupon.It’s best to take a wait-and-see approach to Groupon’s stock. Even if  investors are excessively down on Groupon on its initial offering,  contrarians will have some time to act before people start believing in  the stock.How Groupon handles the next sixth months will be important. To  become a truly viable investment, Groupon will need to improvement its  fundamentals and curb its need to infuse more and more cash. It’ll be  interesting to see if it can pull off the job.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids  its writers from having a financial interest in any security they  recommend to our subscribers.

305475,24607,2011-11-04T16:32:49-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), the online group deal site, recently began trading on the NYSE, Friday November 4, amidst much hype and anticipation. Its shares originally priced at $20, shot up 40% to $28 at the start of the trading day, revitalizing the IPO market. But is there a real basis for Groupon’s relatively high stock price or is it all hot air?We do think it is the later, as Groupon’s fundamentals do not look terribly promising for two reasons:1. Groupon Is OvervaluedInvestors should be extremely skeptical of the price of a stock that lost close to $420 million last year and $117 million in Q1 2011. The 40% up shot of the stock price upon its opening is unfounded and based off hype surrounding Groupon and recent internet IPOs of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE:P), and older IPOs like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Groupon’s pre-market valuation of $13 billion is 30-times higher that of Amazon.com back in 1997 ($430 million), and more than half of that of Google in 2004 ($23 billion).2. Groupon Is A FadGroupon is a glorified coupon company that features online group deals from a variety of different companies. But, ultimately, Groupon is just a middleman connecting potential customers to businesses. This leaves Groupon open to threats on both the costumer and business side of its operation. Many of the bargain hunters using Groupon are doing it out of hype; Groupon is the first to pioneer the online group discount. But, what happens when Groupon is no longer “in” - people grow bored of the group discount fad and move onto the next thing? Groupon will go the way of MySpace.The business side of Groupon’s operation is perhaps the bigger threat. In addition to the steep discounts these businesses have to give Groupon bargain hunters, Groupon takes another chunk out of the pie. Merchants are making little to no money off these deals, so Groupon becomes more of a form of advertisement than a source of profits. In this case, what is to prevent businesses from cutting out the middleman and putting out their own deals?Bottom Line Groupon’s stock is already overvalued. The company doesn’t have a sustainable business model. This means that its stock valuation is all hype with no fundamental basis for its relatively high stock price. I wouldn’t want to own Groupon when the fad dissolves.  I would look to invest in other stocks with less risk and better value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company -  which trades under the ticker GRPN - priced its shares at $20 last  night, but began trading at $28, an increase of 40%.Like LinkedIn (LNKD), Groupon is only floating a small amount of shares,  35  million - about 5.5% of its 637.3 million shares outstanding.

Its total revenues for the  first half of 2011 were reduced from $1.5 billion to $688 million due to  the same adjustment. The company turned down a $6 billion offer from  Google late last year.The company lost $420 million last year and $117.1 million in the  first quarter of 2011 mainly due to expansion and marketing costs - a  fact that does not go unnoticed by potential investors and armchair  Twitter pundits, many of whom could not resist the “sign of a bubble/apocalypse” talk or lame deal jokes this morning.It’ll be interesting to observe the stock’s performance today, to say the least.Update: It looks like the pop has dropped in the first 20 minutes of trading, now hovering around $26.

305498,23899,2011-11-04T17:39:33-04:00,,"By David StermanCongratulations to the founders and early investors in Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).  What was just a humble new business idea a few short years ago is now  valued at about $18 billion. That's a higher valuation than RadioShack (NYSE:RSH), The Washington Post Co. (WPO), U.S. Steel (NYSE:X), Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) - combined!While those companies sport a collective $50 billion in 2010 revenue,  Groupon's sales base won't likely exceed $1.5 billion this year. Said  another way, those companies are poised to earn a collective $2 billion  this year. Groupon isn't even big enough to generate any profits yet.What are investors thinking? Well, that's a question that gets asked every time we see a popular dot-com-based IPO.Blame it on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).  The company's IPO may have seemed somewhat pricey when the company went  public back in 2004, but has since generated a hefty 500% gain for  investors. Since then, investors have been glomming onto other dot-com  IPOs in hopes of catching ""the next Google.""Make no mistake, Groupon isn't poised to become the next Google. Google  is a technology company. Groupon is a sales and marketing company.  Technology companies build moats around their business. Sales-oriented  companies hope to ""make it up on volume"" as increasing market sizes yield more price pressures. Just ask any company that has tried to compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).  In fact, there are a slew of other dot-coms looking to go public in  2012 that arguably have much more defensible business models than  Groupon. And it's only a matter of time - perhaps the next quarter or  the quarter after that - that cracks start to emerge.For those who have missed the entire Groupon story, a quick recap is in  order. The company struck on a brilliant idea: Consumers like bargains  and companies like customers, so why not bring them together? Hefty  discounts have clearly lured customers to try new restaurants and other  retailers, and those companies were grateful for the increased exposure  at a time when consumers were pinching pennies.Trouble is, many restaurants and retailers see Groupon's proposition as a  marketing effort squarely aimed at getting new customers to give them a  try. Losing money on heavily-discounted offers can only be tolerated  for so long, and surveys have shown that most firms that entice  customers with Groupon offers have no intention of sticking with them  once a client base has built up. The fact that Groupon instantly spawned  a host of copycat competitors is really a testament for entrepreneurs  to try any business model  that gets buzz in these spending-constrained times. Indeed, a shake-out  has already begun, as many of these ""me-too"" business models have  ceased operations.How long before Groupon morphs from fast-growing upstart into a mature,  growth-challenged business model? Well, it may already be happening.  According to company documents, revenue generated by the company's Daily  Deals service DROPPED 3% from the second quarter to the third quarter.  Equally damning, the size of those deals is dropping, leading to a 22%  sequential drop on a per deal basis.To address the prospect of a faster-than-expected peak in the core Daily  Deal segment, Groupon is expanding into new categories such as travel,  hard goods and live events. Early results are impressive, generating  more than $30 million in gross billings in the third quarter - up from  nothing in the second quarter. Yet it's fair to wonder how large these  components can really grow, as companies like Priceline.com (PCLN), Amazon.com and others are have long-established links to bargain-seeking customers and will fight to defend their turf.Frankly, nobody can say with certainty whether Groupon is nearing  maturity or has a significant amount of growth left in the business  model. Yet we can say with certainty that the company's $17 billion market value bakes in some extremely lofty expectations. Let's do the math.In the third quarter, Groupon had sales of $430 million, but remained  unprofitable. This is a high-cost business model, as an army of staffers  needs to work with restaurants and other retailers to set up deals.  (Most of the company's 10,000-strong workforce are in sales.)Let's assume the company ends 2011 with an annualized revenue run rate  of $2.5 billion ($600 million per quarter). The company is likely to hit  break-even with quarterly sales at $600 million. (It's worth noting  that Groupon allegedly had 12% operating margins in the third quarter of  2011, but that is an accounting fiction. A number of operating expenses appear to have been capitalized as a ""long-term investment"" when they are really simply the cost of doing business.)Assume 5% operating margins on any incremental sales gains above the  $600 million mark, so for example, a $1 billion revenue quarter would  generate $20 million in operating income  ($1 billion - $600 million = $400 mil.; $400 mil. x .05 = $20 mil.). So  if Groupon is generating $4 billion in annual revenue by 2013, then  operating income is unlikely to top $100 million ($4 bil. - $2.4 bil. =  $1.6 bil.; $1.6 bil. x .05 = $800 mil.). Again, we're talking about a  business worth $18 billion, or 180 times 2013 profits. A potential $5  billion in annual sales by 2014 would only yield $130 million in  profits. You get the idea. Groupon's potential profit levels and its current market value have no relation to each other.It's fair to quibble with those assumptions. Maybe they're far too  conservative. I've read some reports that predict Groupon will have 15%  operating margins by 2013. That seems to be an impossible goal, by my  math. Even if Groupon manages to generate $300 million or $400 million  in operating income a few years out, this business model remains vastly overvalued.  It will be interesting to update this math as subsequent quarters roll  in. The odds that this company will ever live up to its lofty valuation  seems remote.Risks to consider: In the near-term, when the quiet period  has ended, analysts will start to roll out research reports for  Groupon. Some analysts will come up with ludicrous growth and profit margin projections, touting a stock price target well above current levels. This could boost the stock temporarily, creating headaches for short-sellers.Shares  are being propelled by the scarcity factor. Just 5% of the share count  has been released to the public, and insiders can be expected to pour a  lot more stock onto the market next spring when the lock-up expiration  expires. And when these insiders begin to cash out, a shortage of shares  may turn into a surplus of shares. You do not want to own this stock  going into that event.Disclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.Original post"
305268,23038,2011-11-04T04:21:09-04:00,,"There's crazy and then there's really crazy.If you're buying Groupon's IPO you're in the latter camp.Bloomberg claims:A while?Try forever on for size.Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN),  for the uninitiated, sells ""Groupons"" which are online coupons for a  given service or product.  The retailer ""sells"" them to Groupon  (sorta) and Groupon ""retails"" them.  You, as a consumer, buy them as the  end user.So who wins and who loses here?Like paper  coupons a Groupon has a ""use by"" date.  They're attempting to leverage  social media to ""widely distribute"" the Groupons to consumers, and for  this they get a piece of the action.  The merchant effectively pays a  ""vig"" to Groupon for running the distribution system and collecting the  money; once a Groupon is redeemed the merchant gets the paid price less a  discount.From the consumer's point of view these are more like a prepaid  purchase of some good or service.  Let's say the deal is ""50% off"" and  the price is $20.  The ""regular sticker price"" is $40 in your store.You,  the merchant, are selling a ""regular"" $40 product or service for $20.   But in fact it's not $20; Groupon takes a piece of the ""sale price""  of $20 as well, so you might receive $18.  And you receive it late: The consumer buys the Groupon from Groupon.  This goes to Groupon's balance sheet as ""cash"" and the payment to the merchant is an accrued liability.  The merchant gets paid only when the groupons are redeemed.Essentially Groupon ""lives"" on the float.  And that float, if you look at the S-1, is getting bigger as a percentage as the company has grown.  That is, in my opinion, bad, because it means the firm is surviving on two things, neither of which is likely to continue:I  don't like this one bit as a prospective merchant - especially the  second.  I sell at a discount, presumably at or near a loss, and then have to wait to get paid too?  How does this work?  Well, it might, but that would depend on two things:What do I think of the model?  I think it sucks.As a consumer I'll buy a $20 pizza for $10 (one of the deals being offered right now in my area.)  But the entire reason I'll go to that pizza place is that the pizza is $10 -- at $20 I'm not a customer!In this particular case the merchant gets nothing for their trouble except a guaranteed loss and delayed payment!  It's not a ""loss leader"" as I won't come back without the discount, it's a loss maker.How  prevalent is my view on this?  That's the problem - nobody knows.  But  it's the key to the entire scheme, because what I see when I look at  Groupon is a lot of 40, 50, 60% discounts - which sound ok but are big  enough discounts that they're likely to attract people who will buy only because of the deal.  As soon as the deal disappears so does the customer.I  don't see the business case for this company as I don't see the  sell-through on a consistent, forward basis.  Consumers will always take  something for free: The store willing to give away steak will give away every piece of it they have!  That's not the question: Will the people then come back and pay full price for the second slab of meat?I  think the answer is ""no"", and if I'm right on that then the actual  value of the Groupon service is zero, and thus their stock is also a  zero.It's just a matter of time.Disclosure: Oh, what a tasty morsel of a short this looks to be..... Netflix on steroids!"
305066,20851,2011-11-03T15:51:15-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), the online coupon company, is scheduled to make its       long-anticipated initial public offering on the Nasdaq on Friday. And       speculation is already running rampant that the IPO could be higher than       expected.Reuters        reported today that shares of Groupon’s IPO could be priced $1-$2       higher than the $16 to $18 per share that has been forecast. Groupon is       planning to sell 30 million shares during its IPO.The rumored price hike comes as a bit of a surprise considering all the       bad publicity Groupon has received in recent weeks. The SEC determined       that Groupon inflated its 2010 revenue by $400 million, and has twice       asked the company to revise its method of reporting revenue. Furthermore,       the company reported net losses in $101.2 million in June and $10.6       million in September.The recent turmoil casts a shadow over a company that has by and large       been growing at a remarkably rapid rate. Revenue for Groupon’s September       quarter were over $430 million – more than five times the $82 million in       revenue the company reported during the same quarter last year. The       company rose to prominence in 2008 by offering customers significant       discounts on everything from restaurant meals to shoes to vacation       getaways.Despite its lofty growth, Groupon’s spending is outpacing its (seemingly)       considerable revenue. The company’s 2010 operating expenses grew nearly       6,000 percent (!) from the previous year – nearly triple the otherwise       impressive 2,241 percent revenue gains it made in 2010. That’s why some       analysts are questioning whether Groupon’s business model is sustainable.Its reported last-minute price hike is perhaps a sign that Groupon CEO       Andrew Mason’s recent IPO publicity tour, intended to drum excitement       about the stock, has worked. Still, with so much mystery surrounding both       its accounting practices and business model, Groupon’s IPO does not       appear to be worth the risk.Disclosure: None"
305633,20991,2011-11-04T17:15:00-04:00,,"With Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) spiking at the open to $28 per share, this post is likely to get even more coverage. Stocks with big opening-day pops, it seems, tend to fall dramatically thereafter. Which bodes ill for anybody buying Groupon at these levels.But I hate the chart which accompanies the post. It looks as though there is only one x-axis, which goes from -100% to +200%. If a line goes to the right of zero, that means it’s above its IPO price, and if a line goes to the left of zero, that means it’s below… um… not its IPO price, actually. In fact, we’re never told exactly what the red and green lines are measuring.I think — and I’ve gone back and forth with Mark Gimein, the author of the post, on this — that it’s measuring the price action from the opening tick through Nov 2. In other words, it’s showing how the stock did over and above its opening pop: where there’s a green line, the stock opened high and then just went higher.In any case, the good news for Groupon buried in this chart is that if you take the 25 stocks with the biggest opening-day pops, they’re up by 9.25%, on average, from their offer price. So given Groupon’s a big pop, there’s a very good chance that it’ll be above $20 per share for the foreseeable future. And remember that the conventional wisdom, as of a day or two ago, was that Groupon was worth maybe $5 billion tops, or somewhere in the $8-per-share range. Instead, even if Groupon falls back towards $20 from here, it’s still likely to be worth an eleven-figure sum for the foreseeable future.This is good news for me, too. I have a bet on with Rocky Agrawal: if Groupon is worth more than 30% of the value of Priceline (PCLN) on October 31, 2012, then he owes me dinner. Right now, Groupon is worth 72% of the value of Priceline. So I have a nice cushion. At least for the time being."

Clavier guessed accurately that Groupon’s IPO pricing would be about $20 a share and dismissed earlier reports of a $25 billion valuation as unrealistic.On the more modest pricing; “They need a warm reception in the public market, because they have all this baggage — They have all this bad history of press and analysts hating the company,” Clavier said, referring to press coverage of their unconventional accounting on Groupon’s S-I as well as its tricky international expansion and scaling issues.Despite the offering being “oversubscribed” Clavier emphasized that whether or not people actually buy the stock tomorrow and don’t dump it six months from now as the key harbingers of whether Groupon has what it takes to avoid being the Pets.com of our time, “In the long run it’s an interesting viable long-term business.

305048,20149,2011-11-03T15:22:38-04:00,,"Much has been made in the financial press lately about the headwinds facing Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) as it transitions into a public company. I tend to agree with most of the skeptics about the excessive valuation ($13-14 billion even before any first day pop) and questionable growth prospects (there are only so many merchants you can convince to run a deal campaign).It should be noted, however, that profitability should not really be on the list of investor concerns. It is true that for the first nine months of 2011 Groupon's operating income was negative to the tune of about $200 million, but to sign up as many email subscribers as possible, the company is spending an unsustainably high amount on marketing. So far this year, of $1.12 billion of net revenue, Groupon's marketing expense came in at more than $600 million, or 55% of sales, a number hardly ever seen outside of early stage start-ups.If we assume that marketing expense retreats in coming periods to a more reasonable, but still high, level of 25% of revenue, we can see that Groupon can be very profitable almost overnight. In fact, at that level of marketing spend, the company would have netted more than $100 million in operating income for the first nine months of this year. As a result, while Groupon faces numerous hurdles going forward, those concerned that the business model is unprofitable (some have even called them insolvent) are focusing on wrong issues facing the company.

304803,24293,2011-11-03T07:05:20-04:00,,"In over a decade of following the IPO market, never before have I seen such negative press over a high profile deal. There have been hundreds if not thousands of articles written about the Groupon IPO (many of which just re-iterate the same information), and why this particular deal would be bad for investors. It is like the press is writing about Tim Tebow’s inevitable demise without any reference to the millions of Tebow worshippers (and yes I am Tebowing as I write this). Well, let’s keep the negatives aside and talk about the other side of the Groupon IPO and why it will work.But before I go into the 5 reasons of why this IPO will work, let me first say that I am familiar (many times over) with all of the risks and arguments associated with the offering. I know that they had to restate their financials to appease the SEC. I know they have had two COOs leave in the last year. I know there are little to no barriers-to-entry and they face a lot of competition. And I know the company is not yet profitable. So please don’t send me all of the arguments that have already been stated many times over. I am here to tell you I know and I don’t care, because the IPO is going to work.1)      Market Leader: Groupon is the leader in the e-commerce marketplace for discounted daily deals. While there have been hundreds of new entrants into this market, not to mention powerhouses  such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) eyeing this space, Groupon is 5x larger than the nearest competitor, Living Social. Economies of scale clearly play a role in this category, and it can be readily argued that Groupon owns this space as far as economies of scale are concerned. Groupon leads in 35 of the 45 international markets it serves.2)      Growth: Groupon has experienced revenue growth that is unmatched in recent history - from a negligible $5k in 2008 to over $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2011. While many critics are quick to point out that the growth is slowing, I would quickly counter that it is nearly impossible to continue the same growth trajectory once a company reaches the scale of Groupon. In the just-concluded quarter (Q3 2011), Groupon achieved 9.6% sequential revenue growth, 23.4% sequential subscriber growth, 27.8% cumulative customer growth, 32.9% cumulative repeat customer growth, 7% growth in average revenue per customer and 1.5% growth in the number of groupons sold.3)      Funds need to own this stock: While there has been a lot of press quoting investment professionals that say the valuation is still too high at an approximately $10.8 billion market cap, many investment funds simply need to own this stock. Though the company is not necessarily a social media company, it has been connected with the likes of LinkedIn, and there simply are not enough public companies currently in the space. Moreover, it will be hard for tech and growth funds not to own the stock if it does a LinkedIn (LNKD), or even an Amazon for that matter.4)      The underwriters need this IPO to work: The IPO market has been in the doldrums in the past few months due to the market volatility primarily resulting from the European crisis and recessionary conditions prevailing in the U.S. Many deals in the pipeline have been put on hold until there is some clarity within the IPO market. An unsuccessful offering of Groupon's magnitude would definitely not help to jump-start the IPO market. And let's not forget the bankers want to make their year-end bonuses. It is then not surprising that the float of the offering was substantially reduced from previous expectations. A successful offering combined with some solid reported earnings in the coming quarters will go a long way in ensuring the ability to follow up with a secondary offering. The secondary offering would allow the existing holders to sell a portion of their stock in about 6 months.5)      Demand: The offering is said to be well oversubscribed and the books closed a day early for the offering. There is also the expectation that the stock will price at $1 to $2 over the indicated range. All of these indicate a strong offering and thus a strong first day performance for the stock. Since the beginning of 2008, there have been 61 IPOs that have priced above the indicated range, and all but one of these deals opened up on day one (the only exception was Metals USA in April 2010), and all but 2 closed higher on the first day (Metals USA (NYSE:MUSA) closed down and Skullcandy (NASDAQ:SKUL) which priced July 2011 closed flat). The average day one gain for these deals was 36%.I am not trying to portend that an investment in Groupon will work in the long term. Of the 29 IPOs to price above the range so far in 2011, only 16 or 55% are currently above their IPO price. However, with over 96% of the IPOs since 2008 closing positive on day one, I would be willing to bet my autographed number 15 jersey that the Groupon IPO will surely be a success on the debut.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRPN over the next 72 hours."
306063,25045,2011-11-08T03:38:43-05:00,,"OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) stopped its daily deal offers after concluding that fine dining restaurants are better served by real-time revenue management systems that restrict discounts to off-peak periods. OpenTable's rejection of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)-like offers may be a reasonable case study for problems that Groupon may face in other verticals.Ironically, on the same week of the Groupon IPO, OpenTable announced the cancellation of their “Spotlight” daily deal program. When Spotlight was launched about 15 months ago, many investors concluded that it would be a huge success and a boost to earnings. Indeed, the number of deals sold, particularly for the more popular restaurants, was impressive. To expand the program, I imagined that OpenTable account executives would just make a quick phone call to their long-standing restaurant operators, set it up the deal over the phone and OpenTable would send out an email to their massive list of fine dining patrons. However, OpenTable remained in a cautious test mode and only offered Spotlight for one or two restaurants per week in a only a dozen or so markets, despite many more restaurants wanting to do Spotlight offers than OpenTable would allow. Then CEO Jeff Jordan reiterated on multiple conference calls that OpenTable was gathering feedback from restaurants and consumers. They also talked a lot about the competition in the daily deal space and how they felt it was incumbent on them to be innovative on behalf of their restaurant clients. This sentiment is reflective of OpenTable's long-standing strategic decision to serve restaurant operators first and diners second. The CEO's comment, “We have determined this offer [Spotlight] is not one that resonates with the majority of our restaurant base,” clearly reflects this focus.In my view, here is why Groupon-like daily-deal discounts are less than optimal for fine-dining restaurants:OpenTable is attentive to the needs of its restaurant clients and was unwilling to risk long-standing client contracts and relationships by introducing promotional programs which may not serve their best interests. While these programs clearly attracted diners and was a source of profit, OpenTable has a history of being very disciplined about changing their business model in any way.OpenTable has essentially already replaced its Spotlight trial through a partnership with Savored.com. This program is different from Spotlight in the following areas:Participation rates in the OpenTable 30% off deals are very high. For example, 42 restaurants in New York participate in this program on a continuous basis. Thus, the program appears to be highly accepted, at least for now. Real profit contributions can be precisely measured if the server records the actual amount spent by the guest in the electronic reservation book. While some patrons may shift their reservation to an earlier or later time to obtain the discount, in doing so they might be freeing up a full-price, peak-time table that will be reserved by another full price guest or will be taken by a walk-in guest that potentially would have been lost if they had been asked to wait for a table or turned away. Alternatively, many restaurants may not need new customers per se but instead may realize better yield management from seating more overall diners by just filling seats off-peak. Cost of goods sold for most restaurants closely resembles their food costs which are in the range of 30-35% and most kitchen labor is allocated to the entire service period which makes it a fixed cost. Therefore, a more steady flow of diners might just eliminate smoke breaks for kitchen staff or other non-productive uses of employee time.Groupon will be challenged to implement a time-specific offer for fine dining through their GrouponNow! Program that can compete with OpenTable's 30% offers. While Groupon can install similar electronic reservation book systems in restaurants to inform Groupon users of discounted, empty tables, OpenTable will not likely allow their reservation data to be easily shared with 3rd party competitors. OpenTable's rejection of the Groupon-like offers is also a clear warning sign for Groupon's long run success with merchants from other verticals as merchants become more knowledgeable about how to utilize daily-deal offers to drive profit in their business, not just the certain arrival of “new” customers bearing discounted gift certificates. As OpenTable has shown, each vertical served by Groupon is likely to have highly specific needs and Groupon may lack the focus to serve any single vertical optimally before the incumbent software vendors beat them at their own game.While high subscriber growth for Groupon is easily achieved by helping people save money, it is the merchants who must continue to recognize the value proposition of giving so much product or service away in a daily deal offer. Groupon's unique merchant counts grew by 0.2% to 78,649 in Q2 from 78,466 in Q3 despite massive investments in SG&A. This suggest that Groupon's merchant prospects may be rejecting the merit of participating in daily deals. In view of OpenTable's merchant centered evaluation and rejection of daily deals, the fact that merchants may finally be catching onto the unfavorable economics of daily deals should be less surprising to Groupon investors. As a deal broker, Groupon won't have a business unless they can continue to source deal inventory.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN over the next 72 hours."
305016,20991,2011-11-03T14:37:06-04:00,,"Dan Primack gives three reasons why Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) isn’t going to raise its IPO price by a buck or two today. The most important is #2: Groupon really  wants to allocate shares to people who aren’t going to simply flip them  on day one. If it can use a slightly lower share price to attract  long-term buy-and-hold investors, it’ll happily do so.But that’s a big “if”. And in fact keeping the offer price low will  only serve to increase the size of the first-day pop, and therefore  maximize the incentive for investors with an IPO allocation to flip  their shares rather than hold onto them.My feeling is that there are three other, more important reasons why Groupon would keep the IPO price low.The first is that first-day pop. A lot of people think of such things  as an indication that the IPO was mispriced, and that the IPO’s bankers  left money on the table. But for Groupon, the single most important  feature of this IPO is that it be seen to be a success. Groupon has had  worse press in the past few months than any pre-IPO company I can think  of — it’s been absolutely hammered. It’s worse even than  Glencore! The IPO is Groupon’s opportunity to demonstrate that there’s  still a lot of demand for equity in a high-flying, fast-growing  discounter. And the best way to do that is to get lots of headlines  about the big rise, in percentage terms, that the IPO saw on its first  day of trading.Secondly, there’s the small float. Groupon’s only offering 30 million  shares, which means that a dollar rise in the IPO price would get it  less than $30 million in new money. That’s a rounding error for Groupon.Finally, and most importantly, Primack’s article is based on the  premise that “oversubscription typically leads to a price range  increase, particularly at a company like Groupon that could really use  the cash”. But Groupon has been shouting until it’s blue in the face  that it doesn’t need the IPO cash, that it’s fine on the cash front, that the IPO is just a way of going public, and is not really about the money-raising at all.If Groupon were to raise its IPO price now, that would certainly be  seen as an indication that it does need that extra $30 million or $60  million after all. And that’s the last message that Groupon wants to  send to the market, on this of all days.So expect Groupon to price at the top of the indicated range of $16  to $18 per share. And then to have a healthy pop when it opens for trade  tomorrow morning. That’s what Groupon’s hoping for, anyway."
304980,23395,2011-11-03T13:37:15-04:00,,"After months of scrupulous examination underneath the financial media's microscope, Groupon's time has finally come.  Groupon expects to go public  this week by listing shares on the Nasdaq in what very well could  be the most heavily publicized new issue of 2011.  Groupon, the operator  of the well-known group buying website, plans to offer 30 million  shares at a range of $16 to $18 per share in a deal that would value the company at more than $11.2 billion. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are the lead book runners on the offering.Business ModelGroupon operates the leading  group buying site for consumers to purchase goods and services at  50-90% discounts from local merchants in 175 North American markets and  43 countries. It has collected 143 million subscribers who receive daily  emails that offer deals called ""Groupons."" A typical Groupon might sell  for $20 and be redeemable for $40 of food at a restaurant. The company  passes the majority of the Groupon purchase price to the merchant and  retains 30-40% as revenue. Groupon's emergence in the local deals market  has given it the ability to become a major purchasing platform and  leverage its user base to offer new products and services, including  travel (Groupon Getaways), events and concerts (Groupon Live), and  consumer products (Groupon Goods). It has also introduced Groupon NOW,  which allows merchants to instantly offer discounts that can be viewed  on subscribers' mobile phones to drive business during slower hours.FinancialsGroupon has grown extremely  rapidly and generated $1.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter.  Although it has been unprofitable since inception, it reached breakeven  in the quarter thanks to a sharp reduction in marketing expenses.  However, growth slowed noticeably, with 3Q sequential revenue growth of  10%, down from 33% in 2Q. The slowdown was seen most acutely in the  number of Groupons sold, which was virtually flat from the 2Q to the 3Q. The company's revenue growth was driven by a mix shift to higher-value  Groupons.RisksRegardless of the rapid  growth Groupon has used to infatuate potential investors, the company  still has yet to turn a profit. Future earnings will largely depend on  Groupon?s ability to reduce marketing expenses effectively while  maintaining customer growth. Additionally, it must withstand rapidly  increasing competition in the space, including from large companies such  as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Most importantly, for Groupon to keep its  position as a leader in the local deals market, the company must not  lose focus on recruiting local merchants and continue offering subscribers the quality deals that made the company  famous.ReceptionWhile it has become  difficult in recent weeks to separate facts from opinions as media  coverage continues, the fact is that the concerns and praises for  Groupon are both valid. The company offers investors a new business  model in an emerging market and impressive growth. However Groupon still  faces significant concerns about expense management and its ability  to continue customer development. With shares sold in the IPO  representing only 5% of the company's shares outstanding, the stock  could trade up after listing because of this favorable supply and demand  dynamic. However, the Groupon's long term success ultimately hinges on  the economics of the model which remain unproven."
304126,23690,2011-11-01T15:35:15-04:00,,"SummaryGroupon is marketing their IPO right now and is scheduled to price soon if markets and investors permit. This is the most highly anticipated and controversial IPO of 2011. Groupon is reminiscent of Priceline.com, which was bringing a very different business model to the travel industry and led by an eccentric founder/CEO named Jay Walker. The proposed price range is not unreasonable. Peer group companies that have gross margins in excess of 80% trade at 8 to 18x sales. At the mid-point Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is at about 7.2x. But our base case intrinsic value is $11 and a “stretch” version only gets us to $20. We expect this is an IPO many will be looking to “play it for the pop” so near term prices could go anywhere. There’s not enough information yet for long-term investors to own Groupon and the management team is not yet proven enough to rely upon. Positives, Neutrals and Negatives + Groupon is at the heart of a new model of customer acquisition that takes the old concept of “coupon” and reshapes it for the new technology world of mobile and social consumers and local businesses.+ Some investors have positioned Groupon as “another eBay, Amazon or Priceline” based on their leadership in this emerging category of consumer commerce.+ Growth has been remarkable. Revenues for the September 2011 quarter were just over $430m compared to $82m in the same quarter a year ago.+ The lifetime value of a Groupon user suggests the business model can work over time and drive positive margins when spending levels normalize and growth levels off. According to the company they get back about $7-8/quarter for a customer that costs them $18 to acquire.+ The completion of the IPO should provide some additional momentum for their business. Given all the controversy swirling around Groupon merchants will be relieved if IPO goes well, the company get’s a cash infusion (merchants have to be paid) and investors validate the business model.= Marketing spend has been declining sharply as a % of revenue but it has also slowed the rate of revenue growth. It’s not clear how much demand for Groupon is “pull” versus “push.”= Groupon has made much of their appeal to the “Gen Y” audience who combine an interest in getting a good deal with the lack of anything to do or enough “reasons to get out of bed.”- Groupon is going through a product transition that they illustrate in their roadshow with a plateau for “Groupon 1.0” and a new phase of growth driven by “Groupon 2.0” which comprises “Groupon Now!” among some other things. Since launching in May there is no evidence that this strategy is working.- Valuation appears high and doesn’t leave much upside based on intrinsic value. It will take a few more quarters to calibrate a tenable long-term financial model for the business. The company wasn’t bold enough to provide one on their roadshow.- The CEO is young with very limited experience. So far Andrew Mason hasn’t been very reassuring to investors. The management team is experienced but hasn’t had much time to work together as a team.- The deal will improve the balance sheet but still leaves it weak; a concern since Groupon is competing with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). - It’s not clear how much IP protection Groupon has. So far they have relied mostly on their scale as a differentiator. This has worked so far but both Amazon and Google are finding traction in this market.ValuationAny analysis of valuation for Groupon is fraught with weak assumptions. We’ve done two intrinsic value estimates, a base case (which is still very optimistic) and a “stretch” case. The base case suggests an intrinsic value target of $12 for next year. It’s reasonable to use the 2012 IV since it’s October but there’s more risk in that number.To build a model that could justify the filing range we had to dial in sustained high rates of growth, best-of-breed operating margins and a high multiple to go along with it. That can push the shares to $20 on a fundamental basis. Again we have to note that nobody, management included, has any way to know the right long-term assumptions until we see at least another 6-9 months of results.A peer analysis is included below to help guide a discussion of how the Groupon business might develop. Amazon and Google are simply too big to include here but Priceline (PCLN) is a good comparable. The odd name is ReachLocal which is perhaps the closest thing to a similar business that’s public. ReachLocal trades at a mere 0.5x sales and is losing money on their $335M of LTM revenue.Another important point about Priceline is that the stock had a bubble debut, which helped but then spend six years in the wilderness until the company really got traction in 2007. Since then it’s been a big winner but that’s all come in the past three years.

303640,25045,2011-10-31T08:49:13-04:00,,"In the recent past, the most common way for a consumer to guarantee a future promise from a merchant was to pay. For example, pay $20 today and get a $20 gift certificate as a promise for a future performance. Since the recession and credit crisis in 2008, merchants in need of advertising and working capital have the option to sign an agreement with Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) who will distribute promises through the internet at a discount. For example, a $20 promise for a restaurant meal is sold for $10 to a consumer. Groupon retains a fee of $5, and then forwards the remaining $5 to the restaurant owner. Groupon emails the electronic promise for $20 to the buyer.Merchants love it. Groupon claims that there is a 9 month waiting list to be featured in their daily deal email. Consumers love it. In Groupon's first year, it bought $213,600 in promises in 2008 and is on pace to buy $9,200,000,000 in 2011. Indeed, issuing promises is a big business! Groupon CEO David Mason states in its pre-IPO roadshow:Trillions? Is it the largest of the largest? Does even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT) ever say “trillions” in an investor presentation? The only thing that I know is measured in trillions these days are currencies and sovereign debts. Groupon, in fact, has a lot in common with both.For every $25 Groupon receives in net revenue, it issues what I refer to as “Groupon Dollars” worth about $114 that costs it almost nothing to issue via email. In fact, Groupon multiplies money just like our fractional reserve banking system except there is no central bank and no deposit insurance. Groupon explains the Groupon Dollar printing process in animated advertisements. Below are two sequential scenes from a Groupon ad recently running on CNN.com.Unlike legal tender, Groupon Dollars often expire in less than one year and the party guaranteeing the face value, merchant or Groupon, is unclear. The money-back Groupon Promise will refund the consumer if the merchant's service level was unsatisfactory or if the business closes. These amounts are reserved under accrued expenses as “Refunds Reserve.” However, there is a hornet's nest of state's escheat laws regarding abandonded property for any unused Groupon Dollars which are not represented in Groupon's financial statements. Therefore, the most important question for Groupon investors is to ascertain what percentage, if any, of the $9,200,000,000 promises made in 2011 alone should Groupon (just like a bank) be recording as a loss reserve liability or accrued expense on its balance sheet. Total equity is already negative, but how much more negative could it be? From pg. 19 of the S-1, this risk is acknowledged as follows: “If we are required to materially increase the estimated liability recorded in our financial statements with respect to unredeemed Groupons, our net income could be materially and adversely affected.”Fortunately for consumers and prospective Groupon investors, there are a quite a few laws about the expiration of promises. Unfortunately, Groupon, in practice, barely acknowledges that its Groupon Dollars are in fact highly regulated and utilizes the heading “Legal Stuff We Have To Say” in its disclosure to purchasers of vouchers. Harvard Business School assistant professor and attorney Benjamin Edelman has published an insightful working paper on many of the consumer protection issues which Groupon is now facing. John A. Biek, a tax attorney, has also reviewed the relevant case law as it pertains to daily deals and consumer protection and unclaimed property. The references therein these two reports address several material legal topics that relate to Groupon. In particular, Edelman reports that Groupon ran afoul of regulations in Massachusetts which restrict discounts on alcoholic beverages. Twenty-seven other states have similar laws regarding alcohol discounts. Groupon employs 10,000 people and would seem to have the resources to assist merchants in complying with state laws on all issues regarding discounting and the issuance of promises, but in practice Groupon uses generic language in its contracts with largely unsophisticated merchants suggesting that they “comply with any and all Laws.” Despite the contractual effort by Groupon to shift liability to the merchant, the consumer is not necessarily aware of the specific agreement between Groupon and the merchant. Consumers, however, will notice that Groupon is the merchant of record on their credit card statement.The “CARD Act” of 2009 in particular addresses the issue of expiration dates and provides a federal prohibition against expiration periods of less than five years, which is in addition to restrictions already imposed by 27 states. Sixteen class action lawsuits have been filed and are currently being consolidated. Groupon's basic defense may likely claim that its “Groupon Dollars” are exempt because they are “a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card.” There are several disclosure requirements that Groupon may not currently satisfy to win this exemption and there may be sufficient evidence that the short expiration period was marketed as a profit enhancer to merchants who were relying on a certain percentage of offers not being redeemed (i.e. “breakage”) prior to expiration. Although short expiration dates were used to enhance redemption rates by creating a sense of urgency by the buyer, they were also used to suit the operating or staffing needs of the merchant who may have been willing to accept a temporary increase in discounted sales but not after the expiration date. Whatever the motivation, the CARD Act protects the rights of the consumer who tenders prepayment.However, even if Groupon receives a favorable ruling, avoids fines, and short expiration dates are allowed, Groupon may have failed to record substantial liabilities since under the state's unclaimed property laws, expired Groupon Dollars become custody of the state on behalf of the owner until such claim is made, if at all. In addition to expiration, breakage can arise due to any life situation which deters or prevents the consumer from redeeming the offer. Breakage rates are difficult to ascertain because they are very offer-specific but are generally assumed to range from 10-30%.For simplification, a model that estimates unclaimed property assumes the following:To model the sensitivities of these liabilities, the key variables are as follows:Click to enlargeAssuming a breakage rate from 15-20% and Groupon's share of liability in the range of 40-60%, the liabilities range from $243m to $486m (see yellow area), which equates to $4.9m to $9.8m per state, assuming equal sales for each state. Historically, the ability of states to collect unclaimed property from small merchants was limited by the each merchant's record-keeping regarding the issuance of gift certificates. It may have been too costly to pursue collections from thousands of merchants individually. Since Groupon maintains centralized and standardized records, the ability of the states' departments of revenue is significantly enhanced since full records of merchant identity as well as the name, address, amount, and date of purchase are available from Groupon or to some extent the merchant, which also receives certain reports on the offers sold.Suffice it to say that state revenue needs will likely remain high into the foreseeable future and the relative ease with which these records can be obtained may make abandonded property a likely source of revenue. Investors may consider adding these liabilities, which are not currently found on the balance sheet, in estimating Groupon's shareholder's equity, enterprise value, and coverage ratios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in GRPN."
304882,25045,2011-11-03T10:30:01-04:00,,"Executive Summary: Instead of restating key metrics, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has elected to redefine “featured merchants” in an amended S-1 released Nov. 1. Any lack of visibility as to the real metrics serve as a warning flag since Groupon is a negative working capital business where intermittent stalls in growth could erode intra-period cash balances, meaning that additional capital may be required sooner rather than later.While comparing Groupon's latest S-1 from Tuesday to the version posted Oct. 21, I noticed a change in a key definition in the section “How We Measure Our Business” on page 49. The change concerns the method for counting “featured merchants.” For maximum clarity, the full definitions are reprinted below:Obviously, the two sentences in italics above were added to the newest version of the S-1. Additionally, this change in definition was also reflected in the footnotes for 4 different tables of Operating Metrics found on pages 8, 44, 50, and 60. An excerpt from the table on page 60 is shown below.(Click chart to expand)Again, for maximum clarify the footnote is reprinted below:10/21/11 Version Featured Merchant Footnote (7)“Reflects the total number of merchants featured in the applicable period.”  1/1/11 Version Featured Merchant Footnote (7)“For periods after March 31, 2011, reflects the total number of unique merchants featured in the applicable period. For periods prior to March 31, 2011, reflects the total number of merchant deals featured in the applicable period because data as to unique merchants is not available for those periods.”While the values themselves have not changed in the tables between any of the S-1 filings, the change in language for the term “featured merchants” both in the “How We Measure Our Business” sections and the footnotes, show that the data in the row for “Featured Merchants” are not comparable between the periods shown in gray and those shown in yellow (see above). The periods leading up to the end of March 31, 2011, reflect the total number of merchant deals. These correspond to figures presented in the first S-1 dated 6/2/11. However, by the time that the 8/10/11 S-1 was filed, which included the quarter ending June 30,  2011, the definition of featured merchants appears now to have been redefined ex post facto since management is now counting “unique merchants,” Groupon's new term announced Tuesday. The same change in definition now applies to the quarter ending September 30, 2011, also modified as of Tuesday. At this point, it might have been more beneficial to investors to have restated all values so that at least the values would be comparable for all periods since mid-2009. However, by using the term “unique merchants,” management has elected not to restate the values because they were “not available for those periods.” I find it highly unlikely that a technology company is unable to perform a simple database query to identify unique merchants based on whatever criteria it selects. In the meantime, I have to guess that the intent of management is to suggest that merchants who participated in more than one Groupon deal are not counted more than once in the current period. I agree that this is an appropriate way, if better defined, to now show the number of new merchants working with Groupon since management states that “[featured merchants are] a good indicator of growth as well as an important measure of the effectiveness of our sales and marketing infrastructure.” The change in featured merchant definition may have been suggested since Groupon's future growth might derive from the 7 newer Groupon marketing products and consequently a merchant might participate in a multitude of products (or deals) whereas in the past it might have participated in maybe two Featured Daily Deals in a calendar year and therefore counted twice, at least prior to March 31, 2011. This methodology would explain away the very low 0.2% increase in the number of unique featured merchants in the last quarter. The unique featured merchants could consist of both a mix of brand new merchants as well as merchants that were coming back to Groupon from prior periods. However, the quarter/quarter change in the number of Groupon's sold, a slight increase of 1.5% suggest that the sales reps did in fact not sign-up tens of thousands of new and exciting merchants and/or deals because if they had, then the 23% increase subscriber counts, taken together as a network effect, would have led to a marked increase in the number of Groupons sold, not the 1.5% reported. The implication of this finding is that either the content itself is getting stale (i.e. adding 1 more nail salon deal to the 25 that have already run in a market fails to create value for the consumer), the consumer is becoming fatigued or the competition is obtaining similar deals. None of these scenarios is particularly flattering. The change in definition of “featured merchants” has ripple effects to other aspects of the S-1. For example, on page 90, we find the following statement: As shown above, the “190,000 [featured] merchants” would include deal counts from Q1 and unique merchant counts from Q2 & Q3, thereby creating a nonsensical value for featured merchants in the far right-hand column of the table as shown below on pages 8, 44, and 50. There is an additional ripple effect on page 79 in the section for “Our Strategy – Grow the number of merchants we feature” in comparing the versions as shown below:In effect, this is a complete redefinition of the 2010 metrics in that “66,000 merchants” became “66,000 Groupon daily deals for merchants.” This is essentially only true in the circumstance where none of the 66,000 merchants ran more than one deal in a one-year period. On another level, I suspect that the 4,800 sales staff would prefer to be compensated based on the total participation from their existing merchant relationships since those sales are the easiest to close. Since there is a 9-month backlog of merchants who are waiting to be featured on the site, management is probably loathe to compensate reps just for executing the backlog since the merchants have decided for themselves that they want to participate. I could scarcely imagine that Groupon has a sales force that is pre-booking a pipeline of business without compensation up to 9 months in advance, only unless the competitive threats are particularly substantial, in which case the sales staff could be massively reduced in size going forward since sales people will be selling 8 different products to the same set of merchants, not just the Featured Daily Deal product to as many merchants as possible. This scenario would significantly increase margins and profitability. At minimum, investors should receive comparable data, which is logically presented consistently over time - a task that should be simple at a 3-year old company. Changes in definitions are clear signals of business model changes or an active attempt by management to camouflage the real activities of the business. More importantly, the above hair-splitting discussion regarding definitions is important to allowing new business models like Groupon to be successful in public capital markets. In Groupon's case, a negative working capital business deserves special scrutiny since even an intermittent stall in growth (merchant and/or deals) can precipitate intra-period erosion of cash balances. For example, accrued merchant payables ($466m) exceed the sum of cash and accounts receivable ($354) in the latest quarter, irrespective of other potential liabilities. Groupon's monumental growth clearly demands excellent financial reporting and disclosure while changes to metric definitions in such close proximity to the IPO, suggest that in Groupon's case, such controls do not yet exist. In the roadshow, The CEO referred to Groupon's “Deal Factory” as the “secret sauce”. I agree. As an investor, I don't need to know what's in the sauce but it should taste the same for each reporting period.

304635,24394,2011-11-02T17:05:16-04:00,,"Later this week, daily deal juggernaut, Groupon  (Proposed Ticker: GRPN), is scheduled to go public. The company plans to  price shares between $16 and $18 and raise $510 million. But I wouldn’t invest in the deal at any price! Just like I shared Tuesday about Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX), I’m convinced Groupon won’t be around in five years.Sure, it has a novel business model and benefits from being a first  mover in its space. But the same could be said about Webvan, the dot-com  era company that delivered groceries to your doorstep. And we know how  poorly that ended!In 1999, Webvan’s stock doubled in price on its first day of trading.  Yet two years later, the company went bankrupt, rendering shares  worthless.Whether or not Groupon’s IPO proves to be a similarly historic  flameout remains to be seen. But that’s not a bet I’d even consider  making. And here’s why:I’ll say! In 2008, the company pioneered the daily deals space. Yet in three short years, there are at least 300 competitors. The impact of so much competition is clear. As the company’s latest results reveal, its cutting into Groupon’s growth.Third-quarter sales only increased 9.5% quarter-over-quarter,  compared to growth rates of 33% and 72% in the two previous quarters.Heck, all a competitor needs is a deal with a local merchant and an  email list of potential customers. And management knows it’s that  simple. The company’s IPO prospectus flat out says that “no significant  barriers to entry exist” for competitors.As Iain MacDonald, CEO of SkillPages, said, “Their market is not as defensible as Facebook’s or Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG).”“Not as defensible” is being polite, Iain. In my opinion, Groupon has  nothing more than strong brand recognition. And that’s not a  competitive advantage that can sustain an upstart business for years and  years to come.Even if we cut the company a break and consider its earnings  potential – specifically, its revenue share on the average deal – the  picture is less than inspiring. The cut Groupon takes on each deal is  already declining. In the last year, Groupon’s share of each deal dropped five full percentage points to 37%. Again, that’s not a sign indicative of a robust, enduring business  model. As competition heats up, look for Groupon’s revenue share to  continue to get squeezed.When merchants partner with Groupon, they’re offering discounts of up to 50%. No business has margins that robust. In essence, Groupon is a loss leader for the local merchants it  partners with. And the problem with that is it’s debatable whether or  not losing money on the front end to attract customers actually results  in generating repeat business.I’m sorry. But when the benefit to your partners isn’t readily  apparent, identifiable and sustainable, you’re going to struggle to keep  their business. Over time, Groupon’s likely to struggle with attracting merchants  that treat the company’s service as a long-term marketing tool, as  opposed to a one-off experiment.At some point, fatigue is bound to set in. Nobody can shop until they  drop. The novelty wears off. Or worse, it never gains traction.Consider: Although Groupon boasts 142 million subscribers, about 80% never buy a deal. To Groupon’s credit, it’s doing what it can to try to “activate” more  subscribers by offering new types of deals – like Now Deals and  Getaways. But again, competitors can quickly knock-off any successful  initiatives, sending Groupon searching for yet another new growth  opportunity. And that’s a vicious cycle that’s hard to maintain over the  long haul.Bottom Line: After only three years, the daily deal is becoming a  commodity. Not to mention, as Groupon CEO, Andrew Mason, says, “We have  yet to reach sustained profitability, and we have no shortage of  competition.” Add it up and that’s not a business I want to even  consider investing in over the long term. Because I don’t think it can  survive over the long term."

All the updated details can be found in the S1 filing.I would encourage any potential investors to read through and understand what it is you will be investing in. Looking at three recent hot IPOs, Linkedln (LNKD), Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Pandora Media (NYSE:P) should be a good indication what is likely to happen here. Linkedln IPOed at $45 and traded as high as $92. It quickly retreated to $65 and has hit a high of $122 and is currently trading at $87. Zillow IPOed at $20 and quickly popped as high as $44. It is now trading at $27. Pandora Media IPOed at $16 and went as high as $26 and now sits around $15. Most investors trying to get in early paid a high price and quickly saw any potential profit go away. Reading through the S1 here are a few of the warning flags I have seen:After conversion of all types of shares the number of outstanding shares will be more than 630M shares.  Eventually many of these shares will become free trading and the cost basis for early investors will be pennies on the dollar compared with the current price. The barrier to entry does not exist. It has no Intellectual Property to protect it. There is a reason Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been buying up IP like it is candy before Halloween. From the S1.a.  Here is what they claim their main advantage is. The problem being this is Intellectual Property that is going to be highly contested in the future. From the S1:With the small amount of shares being initially released and the usual amount of euphoria created by the 14 firms that are underwriting the company it seems likely that the stock will rise significantly from its initial price. Unfortunately the only investors who are making a killing are the early investors and those buying on the initial IPO day are highly unlikely to make money. Given the current competition and the slowing growth rate in this area based on market saturation, the long-term prospects are very risky. I will not be surprised if some analysts put a sell rating on the shares after the initial pop, just like they did with the Pandora Media IPO.  Why Groupon did not take Google’s generous $6B offer a year ago still remains a mystery and it will be interesting to see if it made the right decision a few years down the road.

301347,22762,2011-10-23T03:24:04-04:00,,"By Rip EmpsonGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has taken a lot of heat over the last six months, some of it deserved, some of it perhaps a bit excessive. There are definitely legitimate concerns about Groupon’s value for small businesses and merchants, but lofty valuations aside, we have to remember that Groupon is still a young company, and the future remains unwritten.The daily deal giant’s IPO roadshow is scheduled to kick off next week, and ahead of that, Groupon released an updated SEC filing on its upcoming IPO, in which it announced that it plans to sell 30 million shares at $16 to $18 a pop, which means that it has to raise between $480 million and $540 million — all resulting in a valuation potentially as high as $11.4 billion.Now, while Andrew Mason wearing a suit and a tie while pitching to potential investors is enough to make anyone nervous, the daily deals behemoth has taken some positive steps of late, namely its closing of the redemption loop with Groupon Rewards. Read Erick’s analysis here.That being said, is it all sunshine and moonbeams for Groupon at present? It’s enormous valuation might lead one to see it as such, but the company shared its Q3 stats today, which were buried in its updated SEC filing.As one can see from the graphs herein, compared to Q2, revenues are up 9.4 percent in Q3 2011 (to $430 million), which is certainly a good sign. However, going further back, this represents a slowdown from 32.7 percent Q2 over Q1 growth and 72 percent growth Q1 over Q4.On the other hand, gross billings actually grew 24.5 percent Q2 over Q1, resulting in $1.15 billion for the quarter. And “Cumulative Customers” hit 29.5 million this quarter, up from 23 million in Q2, all in the face of a decreasing marketing spend and income (loss) from operations dropping from $101 million in Q2 to $239,000 in Q3.Below, we see that Groupon’s income losses from operations had been growing from Q2 2010 through Q1 2011, and remained high in the second quarter of this year. The third quarter of this year, Groupon’s most recent stats show, represent a significant cut in operating losses, and while Groupon remains in the red in this category, the trend is certainly positive.One thing worth noting, however, while far from being dishonest, is certainly conspicuous (and slightly annoying): You will notice in the ninth slide that Robin posted this morning (from Mason’s presentation to investors) gives a jumbled look at the map of significant competition Groupon is facing in the daily deals space. BUT. But, where is LivingSocial, I ask you?Yes, based on the numbers Erick shared in September, Groupon continues to hold the lion’s share of the market at 54 percent, but LivingSocial isn’t exactly just a piddling little lemonade stand on the corner. LivingSocial owns at least 22 percent of the daily deal market, which you would think would give it a more prominent position on Groupon’s “map of competitors”. At this point, The New York Times has a bigger title than LivingSocial, which is pretty ridiculous.Hopefully, that’s just another example of Groupon’s “awesome” sense of humor.Original post"

It seemed that everybody was issuing their analysis of Groupon’s valuation -- some as high as $30 billion a few months ago -- except the investment professionals.  The only thing the pros know is what is in a company’s preliminary prospectus, or “red herring” in Wall Street jargon. And to draw a valuation, the company must declare the number of shares it plans to have outstanding and the proposed price range for its common stock.  These were the missing figures in Groupon’s earlier “red herrings” and to make valuations then was nothing more than speculation by those who were not investment professionals. On Friday, Oct. 21, the company filled in the blanks. Groupon filed to offer 30 million shares of Class A common stock at $16 to $18 each to raise $510 million, the mid-point of the filing range. It also gave the breakdown of the number of shares to be outstanding after the offering: At $17 per share, it places Groupon’s market capitalization -– or valuation -- at $10.8 billion for now.  Of course, this will be subject to change, depending upon any changes in the offering terms and in the market price of its common stock once the stock starts trading. Save the DateBut not everything is found in the “red herring.”  It is the expected pricing date. That becomes available once the proposed pricing terms have been announced.

303135,20991,2011-10-28T09:27:54-04:00,,"Henry Blodget has a smart post on how to value Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) today. Is he right that it’s vastly overpriced at a $10 billion valuation?Blodget’s main thesis is that revenue growth at Groupon is slowing —  and that transitioning from a high-growth company to a relatively  modest-growth company is something which tends to hurt stocks. He’s the  expert on such things; I daresay he’s right. But just for the sake of  symmetry, here’s a simple bull case for Groupon, and for how it could  get its really high revenue growth back.Basically, Groupon’s been involved in a race to get a huge email list  together; its revenues have largely tracked its subscriber base. After  all, if any given deal is going to be bought by X% of your subscribers,  then your revenues are going to be directly proportional to the number  of subscribers you have.Recently, Groupon has found that its earliest subscribers were its  most valuable subscribers, and that it’s getting diminishing marginal  returns from the 100 millionth subscriber. So it’s spending less money  on acquiring new subscribers, and that’s feeding into fewer new  subscribers and slower growth.But Groupon has its huge subscriber base now — which means it’s ready to attack Phase 2 of its plan, and really start monetizing them.Think of it like this: up until now, Groupon has been selling daily  deals to customers. And it’s now ready to pivot, and start selling  customers to merchants on many other fronts.Right now, customers don’t spend all that much money on Groupon: in  the first three quarters of 2011, its 142,865,836 subscribers spent  $2,754,633,000 in total. That’s an annualized rate of about $25 per  year. People love deals, but it turns out that the model of showing them  one deal a day in their inbox is always going to limit how much they’re  ever going to buy.So Groupon is branching out into various other projects, all of which  promise to increase customer spend dramatically — travel deals,  high-priced goods, spur-of-the-moment impulse buys, you name it. Not all of them will work.  But there’s a decent chance that some of them will. And if that  happens, Groupon could easily become as valuable as, say, Priceline (PCLN),  which has a market capitalization of $24 billion. If you look at the  size of the customer base, and the loyalty of those customers, it’s hard  to make a case that a mature Priceline is five times more valuable than  a mature Groupon. After all, Priceline is much more constrained in what  it sells than Groupon is, and it reaches fewer people.Which is not to say, of course, that Groupon is a buy at a $10  billion market cap. But I can easily see how such a thing could be  justified, if the business goes according to plan."

301350,21382,2011-10-23T03:37:40-04:00,,"It’s been a rough quiet period for Groupon CEO Andrew Mason, but as his IPO nears in the next couple weeks the company is making a final push to sell their shares to the public with an IPO roadshow (which you can watch online). Mason & Co. do a good job of putting forward the best possible story to potential investors: Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is addressing trillion-dollar markets, it is the largest local commerce platform with scale effects, it is building on its daily deal dominance to move into adjacent products and markets (events, goods, travel), and it is building a local commerce Triforce centered around daily deals, instant mobile offers, and loyalty rewards.But out of all the roadshow slides, Mason wants investors to focus on the one above because it answers his critics that Groupon is spending its way into oblivion. It shows the return on Groupon’s marketing investments.One of the biggest red flags in Groupon’s SEC filings has been the enormous amount it spends on marketing ($466.5 million the first nine months of this year to “on subscribers acquisition,” according to the latest S-1 filing). In the third quarter, Groupon was able to get its costs under control to the point where it wet from a $101 million operating loss in the second quarter to almost breakeven (with a $239,000 operating loss in the third quarter).The slide shows that in the first quarter of 2010, Groupon spent $18 million in marketing, which resulted in the company adding 3.7 million new customers. Groupon then tracked the spending of that cohort of customers over time. “We pay a fixed amount up front, and we recover our marketing costs in two quarters,” explains Mason. Those customers ended up making enough repeat Groupon purchases that they contributed $100 million to Groupon’s revenues and $43 million to its “contribution profits.”The question I would pose if I was an investor in the roadshow is whether or not that analysis holds true for later cohorts of customers as well. If it does, then Groupon’s unconventionally high marketing budget will result in equally high returns. I wouldn’t be surprised if the returns diminished with later cohorts, but it was also a market share land grab strategy which Groupon is toning down now that it has 142 million “subscribers,” only 16 million of which are repeat customers. Groupon is already focussed on getting more of those one-time buyers to come back.Original post"

At the mid-point  of the proposed range, Groupon will command a diluted market value of  $11.2 billion and an enterprise value of $10.5 billion (or 6.4x  annualized most recent quarter sales).  Recent market volatility, a  slowdown in IPO issuance and heightened media scrutiny have apparently  taken a toll on the valuation; the company had originally been rumored  to be seeking a valuation as high as $25-$30 billion, while estimates of  several months ago had the company targeting a market cap in the  $15-$20 billion range.The  company also reported its September financials in the updated filing.

299033,23690,2011-10-12T04:21:57-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) created a stir with its original S-1 filing back in June. The meteoric growth of the company was accompanied by rather large operating losses. To make things more palatable, Groupon invented a new term, ""Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income (ACSOI)"" to help investors understand its business. Groupon also noted that both gross margin and free cash flow were important indicators for its business.The company posted revenues of $644m for the three months ending March 2011 and a net operating loss of $117m. More stunning were the number of subscribers (83m), merchants (56,781) and Groupons sold (28m). The company sold almost as many Groupons in the March quarter as it did for the entire year 2010 staggering growth.However, some analysis of the big headline numbers pointed to some disturbing trends. Revenue per customer seemed to be declining in areas where Groupon was operating for some period of time. At the same time, customer acquisition costs appeared to be going up dramatically. (That's part of the reason the company lost so much money in the March quarter.) (1)Some investors also noted that insiders had ""already sold out"" by liquidating shares privately prior to the IPO filing. (2) The combination led to a negative predisposition in the marketplace, which prodded Founder/CEO Andrew Mason to include a letter defending the company's ambitions in the updated S-1 on July 14th.With so many customers, it was inevitable that more negative case studies would start to pile up. Again, Andrew Mason couldn't resist responding to critics with his own written missive. (3)The Mason letter does as much damage as good, however, since it paints a picture of a CEO that may not be reassuring. Mason is certainly visionary and aggressive but doesn't yet have the profits or sustained success to pull off a Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin/Larry Page or even a Reed Hastings. So what's left is a rose-tinted rant that includes gems like ""spending more than just about any company ever on marketing"" and ""a rational person would read this stuff and wrongly conclude that we're in trouble.""So where are we now? The company updated its S-1 again with the long Mason letter included, along with comments to ""not use the contents to make an investment decision."" The revised revenue numbers have cut the figures by quite a bit. For the first six months of 2011, the company posted revenues of $688m. (That compares to the $644m it had previously reported for just the three months ended in March.) Operating losses continue to mount at $204m through June.Adding to the cloudy picture, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is beginning to get some real traction with ""Google Offers"" and is looking like a serious competitor. Just a few weeks ago, Groupon COO Margo Georgiadis decided to leave Groupon (along with $25m in stock options) to rejoin Google after just 5 months working for Mason.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) isn't sitting still either and it has massively expanded its Amazon Local service to 40 markets and is seeing a huge ramp in revenues (this, according to recent analysis from Yipit.)  Having Amazon and Google executing well in your backyard is not generally good news.Even with the markets in turmoil, the official word is that the company still hopes to complete an IPO at some point in the future. The filing is still missing final share count and proposed pricing, but with 13 investment banks on the cover (including leads Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse), there are lots of mouths to feed. If the estimated total share count of 300m is correct, then the company is likely to file at $25-30B valuation range if the typical $9-11 share price is used. The company probably needs at least another year of operations to support that valuation.We have not performed an IV analysis yet. Most valuation estimates for Groupon so far have been based on a multiple of revenue. This method is worthless unless it's clear that the company will make money and at that point an IV will be more instructive.References:1 blog.yipit.com/2011/06/03/groupon-s-1-re...;2 techcrunch.com/2010/12/30/groupon-inside.../3 allthingsd.com/20110825/exclusive-groupo.../  Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Now, institutional investors are wary. A fund manager quoted in a Bloomberg report today suggests that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) might have to reduce its IPO valuation to between $3 billion and $5 billion in order to get it out the door. That valuation would be below the $6 billion acquisition offer Groupon turned down from Google last year. Another fund manager says that Groupon may have to delay its IPO further or even pull it.All of this goes to show that six months can be an eternity when it comes to the IPO window. Since the days not so long ago when nobody blinked at its proposed $25 billion valuation, Groupon has taken a beating for some of its accounting practices, cash burn rate, and other financial details revealed in its SEC filings, which have been revised several times. Last month, it restated the way it accounts for revenues to a more conservative set of numbers, and announced that it lost its second COO in less than a year. It is facing increased competition from Google, LivingSocial, Facebook, and hundreds of other smaller startups. And of course, the overall stock market’s downward spiral isn’t helping matters any.Delaying the IPO may not be a bad idea if Groupon can cut its costs (a big part of which is marketing and sales) to a more sustainable level. Without slashing costs, it will find itself in a cash crunch. The company spent $432 million on marketing in the first 6 months of 2011 ($345 million of which was on online marketing to acquire new subscribers). It had $225 million in cash.Despite the IPO drama, Groupon still dominates the daily deal market and is introducing strong new products such as Groupon Rewards, which could deepen its relationships with local merchants. If Groupon pulls its IPO and then files again in a year with profits and a much stronger financial condition, investors will have a better idea of how to value to the company.Image credit: Thomas BowerOriginal post"

Given that Groupon is currently in the process of going  public, this doesn’t seem to bode well for the company.

In its previous filing,  Groupon reported that it had $1.5B in revenue for the six months ended  in June — it now reports $688M for the same time period. The key  difference: before now, Groupon has included the full value of a  purchased Groupon as part of its revenue figures, and now it’s only  considering the portion of the Groupon that they actually keep (a  significant percentage of each Groupon goes back to the merchant).Finally, the revised S-1 also discusses Andrew Mason’s internal memo that leaked last month.Here’s the Groupon blog post announcing Georgiadis’s departure:Original post"

Groupon filed its latest update on  Friday morning with additional adjustments to its S-1.   The largest modification is the additional disclosure Groupon provides  regarding CEO Andrew Mason's leaked memo to employees.  Friday's amended  filing includes the full text of the infamous email, excerpts of which  appeared in a previous filing.   Groupon's  large marketing expenses has received much scrutiny from investors, who  worry that any slowdown in spending would result in a commensurate  decrease in revenue.  The company states in its newest filing that it  anticipates ""significantly"" decreasing subscriber acquisition costs over  time, and that this decrease will not adversely impact ongoing  business.  However, it also adds that ""we cannot assure you that such  reductions will not have an adverse impact on our revenue.""  While this  is typical boilerplate disclosure, it is yet another sign of how focused  the SEC regulators are on making sure Groupon does not paint an overly  optimistic view of the business.  Similarly, Groupon added further  disclosure regarding comments made in the CEO's email about its joint  venture in China.   In an interesting development, the amendment also removes language  referring to ""selling stockholders,"" implying that existing shareholders  no longer plan to sell in the offering.  This update is particularly  revealing as it indicates a move to address potential pushback from IPO  investors.  Given the controversy surrounding Groupon's IPO, short track  record and lack of profitability, any selling by insiders (particularly  after they cashed out $900 million to date) would likely be viewed as a  negative signal to IPO buyers.

Rate of change is the speed at which a variable changes over a specific period of time.  It measures momentum.CONCLUSION Groupon may be worth a quick flip in the IPO market.  However, the analytical results below should give long-term Groupon investors considerable pause.Rate of change analysis proves that the Groupon high flying rocket is headed down.Notice the quarterly change in Groupon’s sold is only 1%.  Other quarterly changes are –21% for Groupons sold per customer; -17% for subscribers added; -12% for customers added; and -14% for revenue per customer.   VALUATION Groupon is trying to value itself by comparing its book value with Linkedin (LNKD) and Pandora (NYSE:P), all in the range of 20+ book value.  Groupon is also offering a price-to-sales discount relative to LNKD, P and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z).  Annualizing the most recent quarter, the respective price-to-sales ratios are 6.3, 16.8, 8.4 and 12.5.Notice, however, that LNKD and Z were both profitable in their last reported quarter.More Groupon Valuation metrics hereCOMPETITION Entry barriers are low.  Current major competitors include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN).  And if the daily deal market had sustainable growth, which we believe it doesn't, then even Microsoft (MSFT) might be tempted.  FREE CASH FLOW & WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT Groupon touts its free cash flow, which happens because GRPN collects cash from retail customers and holds the money before paying retailers.  In the U.S. GRPN pays after 60 days.In international markets Groupon doesn’t pay the retailer until the coupon is ‘cashed’ at the retail establishment:  Groupon ‘pockets’ unused coupons – no wonder cash flow is positive.However, going into the IPO Groupon has a working capital deficit of over $300 million. That’s not a healthy way to run a business.INVESTOR CASH OUTS Going into the IPO GRPN has a negative net worth of $15 million.  No wonder GRPN insiders have already cashed out of almost $1 billion.INEXPERIENCED CEO RED FLAGSNo Accounting Experience GRPN CEO Andrew Mason, age 30, was a music major in college and apparently had no accounting classes.   Real world lack of experience showed up when the SEC pushed back on GRPN’s creative accounting approach and required the company to restate its financial results – always a very bad sign.Professional Managers Wanted by Investors When a company grows fast, professional investors always want to bring in someone with growth experience, especially with IPO experience.  Working with Andrew Mason is apparently hard to impossible for professional managers.For example, GRPN’s president resigned last Spring and the newly hired COO, former Google sales vice president Margo Georgiadis, resigned about same time the SEC lowered the boom on GRPN and required financials to be restated – yes, there’s probably a connection there.In addition, after only two months GRPN’s public relations chief quit in August.WE”VE NEVER LIKED GROUPONWill Groupon Ever Be Able To Complete Its IPO?  Groupon: No Sustaining Competitive Advantage  Groupon: The Good and the BadUSE OF PROCEEDS GRPN expects to net $479 at price point mid-range of $17.  The money is allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes.  As a result of the IPO GRPN will finally have positive working capital, at least for the time being.

291730,24834,2011-09-06T08:36:41-04:00,,"I’m always interested to see new business models emerge, and the internet has played a huge role in changing the way society operates, and the way people think about commerce. Online delivery has had a huge impact both on my life, and the way that I shop. If I want to buy something — a book, or a piece of furniture, or a piece of equipment, I can find it online, and order it, and it will arrive at my door. Previously, I had to go to the shop, look around the shop, collect, pay and go home. Now I just go to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), then Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the product is in my hands the next day.Now, if this is revolutionary for me, it is even more revolutionary for sellers: instead of maintaining expensive retail real estate, they can maintain low-cost warehouses, and increase the range of products they stock . Of course, this new model presents challenges to established retail businesses, and to local government and communities who see town centres increasingly deserted, and more and more physical retailers going out of business if they can’t adapt. But that’s the nature of capitalism: things come and things go depending on what is popular, and what attracts custom.But there are a certain class of businesses that have not been quite so affected by the online-retail revolution. Businesses like nightclubs, health spas, and restaurants where the physical premises is a huge aspect of the business model. Restaurants can’t establish a warehouse where food is assembled and send it out to the customers’ homes. I am sure McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has given this serious thought, but it just wouldn’t work — customers want freshly prepared food, delivered to their table in a bricks-and-mortar restaurant. Nightclubs can’t deliver themselves to me either — although the fact that I can stream any music I choose from Spotify and dance around my bedroom is surely a threat to their business model.The Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) model aims to shake up these kinds of businesses by offering access to entirely new markets. Groupon signs up businesses to offer huge discounts in exchange for large new numbers of customers. The theory is that everyone wins: customers get a product at a massive discount, businesses get access to new customers, and Groupon gets a portion (typically half) of sales for the hookup. Well, on the face of things, this model has proven very successful: Groupon is supposedly the fastest growing company in history. Furthermore, it has higher revenues per engaged user than any other major web business including Google:But the problem is that there are very few businesses for which Groupon can sustainably recruit customers. Giving up 75% (that’s a 50% discount, and 50% of the sale to Groupon) of revenue on sales — even to “attract new customers” — cannot be sustainable in the long run. From Jose Ferreira:And because Groupon’s management won’t release the figures on how many businesses return to Groupon, it is impossible to know just how unsustainable Groupon’s model is. Groupon has successfully generated a whole lot of cash from first-time Groupon merchants — taking 50% of the sale as a middleman is a pretty sweet deal — and has used that cash to recruit more new businesses. But if businesses drop out after one or two deals because they are losing too much money, then those growth figures are illusory.It would come undone simply because not enough businesses will be able to offer deals on Groupon’s terms. There are an awful lot of ways to get new customers — offering a 75% plunge on your margins seems an extremely risky one.And is Groupon’s management coming to realise that their model is in danger of rapidly losing steam? From Business Insider:That’s right — $130 million funding, $10 million goes to growing the business, $120 million goes to the founders’ pockets. So while the euphoria grows — particularly around the above graph — it should be patently obvious to anyone with a clue about business that Groupon is falling into a failed model. At very best, it can build up a roster of merchants who can afford the margins, but this roster will probably be thin, and deals may become stodgy and repetitive.The first real question is “why”? I hinted at the answer above — Groupon’s business model is that of a very big, very greedy middleman — and a very, very big overhead to small businesses who look to recruit new customers. Do middlemen create value? No — they parasitise both the consumer and the producer. And the point of the internet has been largely to reduce the role of middlemen, and reduce overheads. Having a great website and selling directly to consumers for a fair price will reap far more rewards in the long run than signing up for Groupon’s shenanigans.Businesses who use Groupon’s model may have to jack up prices for non-Groupon customers just to recoup what they are losing on all of those new customers, many of whom are the type of bargain hunters who won’t stick around if businesses stop offering steep discounts. They’ll bumble off after whatever it is Groupon (or any of its competitors) are offering at a steep discount.So, in many ways, Groupon is a step backward. It may have been founded with the best of intentions, but in light of the fact that its founders are rushing to an IPO to quickly recoup their money and get the heck out of dodge, it seems like this reality is obvious to them. It is not a sustainable business model that offers any new service or product to consumers. Instead it is just a quick and nasty way to generate massive revenues, and massive growth for as little effort as possible and on the backs of other businesses.The second real question is “how long can it last”? I don’t know the answer, because I can’t guess at what kind of penetration Groupon might get to before it runs out of steam. It is entirely conceivable that the IPO could go well, Groupon’s value could rise and rise by continuing to recruit new businesses for deals. But what is clear is that this growth will eventually hit a huge, impenetrable wall.The only hope for Groupon is that it can leverage its position to drastically change its business model to something more sustainable. But this is not the kind of “branching out” that Google, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are famous for. Google’s core business — search — is extremely solid. Apple’s core business — hardware — is extremely solid. Microsoft’s core business — software — is extremely solid. The difference between other high-tech companies and Groupon is that Groupon’s core business is a house of cards."

Now we’re guys, while Groupon skews female.  And most likely we do know people who use Groupon; we just  don’t know who they are. But the fact is that at heart it’s pretty  uncool. That’s fine — many hugely successful companies are uncool and  based on saving people money, up to and including Walmart (NYSE:WMT). But here’s  the problem: Groupon can’t afford to be uncool just yet, because it  needs to do one last big capital-raising round at a high valuation in  order to get the cash it’s going to burn through in the coming year or  two.Henry Blodget  has some smart analysis today, concluding that “if Groupon raises a  boatload of money in an IPO, the company will be able to keep spending  aggressively on marketing and not have to worry about running out of  money or dealing with slower growth for a while.” So it’s important that  Groupon is able to tell its high-growth, high-intrinsic-profitability  story at least through its IPO.But Groupon’s web traffic looks like it might be falling, and Connie Loizos has been talking to analysts, including PrivCo’s Sam Hamadeh, who increasingly, don’t buy it:The monthly spend per customer is a key number to look at. There  doesn’t seem to be any doubt that it’s going down; the big question is  whether it’s going to level off with Groupon becoming a big and  sustainably profitable business, or whether it’s just going to approach  zero.Or, to put it another way, can Groupon make the transition from being  a fun fad to being a basic part of the way people spend money on a  monthly basis? I think  it can. But in order to do that, it’s going to have to concentrate  increasingly on targeting and on the quality of the merchants it chooses  to feature."
291045,24764,2011-09-01T03:42:54-04:00,,"There has been a lot of speculation about Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) much anticipated IPO. Groupon has been getting a lot of negative press and analysts have even begun to question Groupon's viability as a business. What interests me about this situation, is all the negative news that is being brought up by analysts. Analysts have concerns regarding Groupon's losses. Groupon has always invested heavily in customer acquisition and marketing. In fact Groupon has incurred net losses since its inception. Groupon spent over $179 million in the first quarter of 2011 on online marketing. This investment caused Groupon to lose $102 million in the first quarter of 2011. As the IPO draws closer many on Wall Street are now worried about Groupon's future.I have a contrarian view to this belief. This could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growing company that could be a dominant force in the advertising industry. I understand that Groupon has lost money since inception, but if you put their growth in perspective, I can understand why.Here are highlights to Groupon's growth:- Revenue increased from $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2009 to $644 million in the first quarter of 2011.- Groupon expanded from 5 North American markets in June 2009 to 175 North American markets and 43 countries as of March 2011. - Subscriber base increased from 152,000 in June 2009 to 83 million in March 2011.- The number of merchants in Groupon's featured marketplace increased from 212 in the second quarter of 2009 to 56,781 in the first quarter of 2011.I would find it impossible to achieve this type of growth organically without making a significant investment in the business. The mistake made by Wall Street, is the belief that this investment in marketing is required by the company. Groupon doesn't need to make this investment in order to stay in business, they do it for strategic purposes. Many analysts believe that Groupon's losses are evidence that their business model doesn't work. This is way over-exaggerated and is not even close to what Groupon is trying to do.Groupon is trying to play on their first mover advantage. Being the daily discount leader, many merchants and customers are flocking to Groupon. By quickly expanding into new markets they can look to maintain that advantage. I view Groupon as the new up and coming Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Now this might sound like a bold statement, but I'm strictly talking about Google's search advertising business. We all know that Google is the dominant player in the search advertising market. Google revolutionized the way small businesses were able to compete in the large internet marketplace against much larger competitors. Many viewed Google as the company that leveled the playing field for smaller retailers.Groupon is doing the same thing but they are going after a different set of customers. Groupon is allowing brick and mortar businesses a chance to now compete with larger competitors. Groupon allows small businesses a chance to advertise to a larger audience on a small budget. Groupon is one of the few internet businesses that are actually generating big revenue growth. Groupon is also involved in almost every industry indirectly through the sale of their Groupons. I like how this creates a steady stream of revenue for Groupon compared to traditional online advertising. Groupon is basically pre-selling products and services that consumers have to purchase in order for Groupon to make money. The best part is Groupon doesn't have any cost of goods on those products and services. Groupon could actually benefit further from an economic slowdown compared to online advertising which could suffer. Since merchants don't have an upfront cost, many merchants are willing to run Groupon specials to generate more business during economic slowdowns. There are also more customers looking for deals which will accelerate their sales.How does this compare to the traditional method of online advertising? Merchants don't have to pay up front in order to participate in Groupon's program. Groupon just deducts their share of the sales and forwards the balance to the merchant. In search advertising or banner advertising, the merchant would have to come up with the investment up front with no guarantee that their advertising campaign will work. Regarding Groupon's profitability, Groupon can minimize their marketing expenses at any time. I feel they don't need to continually invest such a large amount in their marketing if they don't want to. Groupon has a large customer and merchant base which could be used to continuously generate business. This customer base will continue to grow even if Groupon were to cut a large part of their advertising budget. Groupon could turn profitable today if they wanted to but they would be sacrificing growth. A lot of what Groupon is doing has to do with their strategic advantage. Groupon's business is a lot harder to duplicate than many analysts are giving them credit for. After all, there are many options in search advertising but many businesses still prefer to use Google. Why is that? It's mainly because Google has the customer base and traffic that merchants want. Groupon has that same advantage with their 83 million subscriber base.I like Groupon and believe in their future. I feel that we could see some really big things in the future and once Wall Street realizes that, early investors will be sitting pretty. I'm hoping for a sell-off in Groupon once they go IPO. I will view a sell-off as an opportunity to build a long term position at a good price. I rarely invest in IPOs as a long term investment, but if I get my price I will definitely pull that trigger.If you want to read the prospectus you can find it here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
295690,23115,2011-09-24T14:46:13-04:00,,"About a month ago, I remarked on Groupon’s explosive revenue growth (and its equally impressive cost growth).The company revised its financial results yesterday, and the revenue picture looks less explosive. In the latest update of its S-1 registration statement,  Groupon (proposed ticker GRPN) reported $393 million in Q2 revenues. That’s a remarkable  figure for such a young company but a far cry from the $878 million  it previously reported.And what happened to the almost $400 million in missing revenue? That  money–payments to the merchants who provide goods and services for  Groupons–is now subtracted before reporting revenue rather than deducted after as an expense. In short, Groupon went from a gross measure of revenue to a net one.The bad news for Groupon is that the new presentation makes the  company appear less than half as big as it did previously. The good  news, I suppose, is that its expenses went down by the same amount.Groupon’s effort to go public has been one of the bumpier ones in  recent memory. Its first filing emphasized a profit measure, essentially  profits less marketing expenses, that was widely ridiculed. That got  dropped in the second draft. And now a gigantic restatement of revenue  in the third draft. Not to mention, the company’s  recent difficulties with the SEC’s quiet period requirements."
292223,22300,2011-09-07T15:12:45-04:00,,"Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) recently announced that it was delaying its IPO. Since the announcement, Groupon haters have come out in full force, using the IPO delay as an opportunity to remind the public of Groupon's historical blunders. The most memorable Groupon blunders include an expensive Super Bowl ad that reminded many of the kinds of Super Bowl ads broadcast during Bubble 1.0; the ad was also interpreted as politically offensive by many, and Groupon was slow to apologize. In addition were the use of a controversial accounting methodology that downplayed the cost of customer acquisition and an ""accidental"" leak of an internal memo to employees that could be interpreted as violating the SEC's silent period mandate.While these blunders provide haters with ammunition, they may have the effect of obfuscating the real problems with Groupon. The firm is basically a sales organization with no specialized niche. Without internal software developers or a community of developers working off an API -- something much more common with the rest of the firms in Bubble 2.0 -- Groupon will be very limited in its ability to leverage network effects and to create personalized offerings. I am a big believer in sales/service organizations, particularly Internet-oriented ones, but they need to be niche-oriented and leverage specialized knowledge to succeed, not simply a mass-market play, which will be better served by software-oriented infrastructure companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Spending more than you're taking in may be fashionable for nation-states and venture capital-funded Internet companies, but it's a recipe for failure. Groupon's strategy of ""get a lot of users and then make money,"" and its belief that a high cost of customer acquisition is justified because the lifetime value of these customers is even higher, is unlikely on the basis of historical precedent. I recall hearing the same arguments as an analyst focusing on Internet stocks during Bubble 1.0; CDNow is one example of a company that vastly overestimated the lifetime value of customers during the bubble, and was forced to re-work its marketing costs after the bubble collapsed. I expect the same of Groupon. Groupon is the worst of the Bubble 2.0 crowd; it is the one most likely to be a Ponzi scheme, the least defensible, the least likely to leverage meaningful network effects, and the most overfunded. I don't believe Bubble 2.0 is ending; rather, I expect it will resume once the Fed announces more stimulus. But Groupon is the worst of the bunch. I don't recommend shorting in this environment unless one is an active trader very fluent in technical analysis, but Groupon is one I'd stay away from if the company ever manages to get to the IPO window, even for those bullish on Bubble 2.0.

The company founded by Andrew Mason was hyped up for a few months. After declining a $6 billion offer from Google, the company announced its plans to become public but things have been far less positive since then. After news leaked that Groupon was considering turning public at a $20 billion valuation, many analysts did their homework and found that such a price would have been an exaggeration. Why?-The company is not that profitable: Doubtful accounting methods made Groupon’s financials look much better than they really were by amortizing marketing costs over time.-Founders Selling Out: One of the big surprises that came out of Groupon’s initial filing papers is how much stock the founders and early employees have already sold. Do they think the company is at its top? Maybe not, but it certainly does not reflect too well either.-Competition Is Fierce: Not only is LivingSocial (part owned by Amazon) a major competitor but other big players like Facebook and Google quickly moved into the daily deals. Add local players as well as niche specific ones (Travelzoo in travel for example) and you can certainly see why margins are down big time.-Benefits To Merchants Questioned: The daily deal business can only work in the long term if merchants are also winners and it’s unclear if that is really the case. Why? The daily deal searchers are not necessarily coming back, not spending as much and the-Bubble Talk: When the media and analysts discuss the possibility of us being in a bubble, examples such as Facebook and Groupon are mong the first ones to be mentionedI personally am happy to see the hype come down, which might provide some opportunities. In the short term, Groupon has delayed its IPO and will certainly wait for a more favorable context to go public. I think the future is still bright for Groupon. Why?-Competition Will Calm Down: I do think that LivingSocial is there to stay but seeing Facebook pull out and Google struggle to some extent certainly shows how difficult of a business this is. The daily deal business requires a lot of well trained employees and Groupon has done a good job building that network. In fact, according to recent reports, Groupon had a great month of August while competitors struggled.-Strong Brand: One thing that Groupon did incredibly well was to gain market share almost everywhere in the world, very quickly making it very difficult to compete with, Groupon which has a name associated with credibility. The challenge will be offering a good service to merchants and consumers through all of those local branches but I personally do think Groupon will come out on top.-Pressure Is On: Founders and executives at Groupon have put a lot of pressure on themselves with some already discussing the possibility of replacing Andrew Mason. I do not see it happening but I do imagine that will highly motivate Groupon to show they are doing things right.-Groupon’s Growth Was Done Right: In June 2009, Groupon had 37 employees and 2 years later it is approaching 10,000! Impressive growth but was it too much, too fast? I don’t think so. Anything less than spectacular growth to become a major relevant player around the world would have made it rather easy for global companies such as Google and Facebook to take control of the daily deals space.Like every other investment, it will end up being about how much Groupon ends up going for and how much that ends up representing in terms of revenues and profit multiplies. I am certainly hoping the IPO occurs soon!"

SUMMARY -- The daily deal market itself appears to be shrinking (at least the 'growth' rate is shrinking) based on what Yelp, Facebook, Living Social and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) are jointly experiencing.  Groupon is currently running at a $408 million rate of yearly losses, margins are declining, usage per customer is declining. Profitablility is not in sight now, if ever.  In short, it's not clear that Groupon's business model is sustainable on a longer term basis.Which begs the question, why would rational investors even be interested in an IPO from Groupon?The answer is that it will probably happen at some price because investment bankers are incentivized to complete the deal no matter what.  Plus, out of Groupon's large customer base there may be enough investors who are not able or willing to evaluate comparative market valuations in the context of growth drivers, competition, and other rational metrics.For example:. Yelp Follows Facebook in Scaling Back Daily-Deal Service. Groupon, LivingSocial Unique Visitors Fall From June PeakOVERALL GROSS MARGIN DECLINES -- GRPN’s gross margin in the June quarter compared to the March quarter declined 8% to 38.8%, which is a low gross margin for a supposedly internet-based business.  Low gross margin companies in general are not afforded high stock market multiples.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an exception.COOKING THE BOOKS -- Groupon showed a loss of 12% or $102.7 million, on revenue of $868 million for the June 2011 quarter.  The loss held even compared to the March quarter only because Groupon cut ‘marketing expenses’ to 13%, to $176 million in the June quarter down from $202 million in the March quarter. In some circles that's called ""cooking the books.""STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS -- Groupon’s structural problems include. Very high cost of customer acquisition. Declining gross margins per coupon. Declining number of Groupon’s sold per customer.Where’s the silver lining?  There is none.Source: Groupon’s August 10, 2011 S-1 page 57Full Disclosure -- we have never liked Groupon.Groupon:  no sustaining cometitive advantageGroupon:  the good & the badDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
290287,20991,2011-08-29T01:20:44-04:00,,"Has Groupon created an inherently profitable industry? Or is it one of the most effective means ever invented of taking investors’ money and setting fire to it? Since I wrote my big post on Grouponomics in May, the optics surrounding Groupon have changed considerably. Jeff Bercovici, for one, is convinced there’s nothing there:Jeff quotes Rob Wheeler, who’s equally adamant:But the problem here is that neither Bercovici nor Wheeler seems to understand what Groupon is doing. I have my own doubts about whether Groupon will be able to achieve long-term success without running into a short-term liquidity crunch, but there’s nothing inherently illogical about Groupon’s cash-burning drive for growth.For smart analysis of Groupon, you’re much better off reading Vinicius Vacanti and especially Henry Blodget — but be sure to read them carefully. Both of them are being quoted by the likes of Bercovici and Wheeler, who are drawing broad and simply false conclusions from what they’re reading.At heart, what Groupon is doing makes sense. Its core business, I’m pretty sure, is profitable — although no one knows just how profitable it’s likely to prove over the long term. If you give Groupon a large number of subscribers in some given city, and a team of sales people in that city, those sales people will be able to sell deals to local merchants in such a way as to more than cover their own costs. That’s the model at the heart of Groupon’s business, and historically it has worked spectacularly well. It’s worked so well, in fact, that Groupon has found it incredibly easy to raise new equity capital and to grow faster than any other company in the history of the known universe.Groupon has used all of its profits from selling deals to expand aggressively — to sign up new customers and launch in new cities and countries. This costs money, but it makes sense, given the substantial first-mover advantages available in the space. Groupon wants to be first to any given market, and it aspires to become a kind of corporate shorthand, like Hoover or Kleenex or Xerox, where the company name is used to refer to the whole class. Growing as fast as Groupon has done is expensive, but Groupon is convinced that the more money it spends up front, the more money it’ll ultimately end up making in any given market.All this makes a lot of sense, and nothing we’ve seen with respect to Groupon’s losses invalidates any of it: there is no reason to believe that Groupon is in an inherently unprofitable business. Contra Wheeler, Groupon did discover a viable business model. And it’s just silly to think that when you buy a Groupon, that in some way Groupon’s investors are financing your cheap consumption: the cost of your cheap consumption is borne wholly by the merchant in question.In fact, one of the two problems with Groupon is that its investors aren’t financing Groupon’s growth. As Blodget points out, of the $1.1 billion that Groupon has raised from equity investors, fully $942 million has been used to cash out its early investors and executives. If Groupon had held onto that cash and used it to finance its growth, it wouldn’t be facing a cash crunch right now. Groupon should be able to use the proceeds from its IPO to cover any potential cashflow crunch — but it’s nice to have the option not to IPO, if the market’s looking weak. Groupon should be able to tap its current private investors in the event that its IPO gets postponed or canceled — but right now they’re looking to make money on their investment, rather than throw more cash at it.The other problem with Groupon is that its fundamental business model is looking less profitable than we might have once thought. This is Vacanti’s point: in mature markets, Groupon is making less money per subscriber, and less money per merchant, than it has ever done in the past. The latter decline is particularly precipitous:Now this isn’t necessarily as bad as it looks. The number of merchants that Groupon has in a town like Boston is a cumulative number: we’re looking at quarterly revenues, here — a flow — divided by a steadily-growing stock of merchants. Even if you haven’t done a Groupon offer in years, you’re still part of the denominator; my guess is that even merchants which have closed down entirely are included.What really matters, in Boston and elsewhere, is whether Groupon can stay substantially profitable in such mature markets. And that’s why it’s a little sad and indeed a little worrying that Groupon is getting rid of its ACSOI profitability measure — something which is at heart, as Groupon CEO Andrew Mason explains, was always an attempt to try to work out the steady-state underlying profitability of the company’s operations. Maybe Groupon got rid of it because of all the criticism — but it’s also possible that Groupon jettisoned ACSOI because it was worried that it was falling sharply and maybe even headed into negative territory.Over the long term, I suspect that Groupon will succeed or fail based on the perceived quality of its offers. It has grown fast based on the simple tactic of offering great deals to consumers — giving them things for much less than they would normally pay. But at some point, it would do well to start concentrating more on quality rather than just price. Here’s Ryan Sutton:The thing to pay attention to here is the perception of Groupon: that it’s a desperation move for mediocre merchants. If that reputation spreads, then Groupon will find it increasingly difficult to move its product, no matter how wittily-written its emails are. So if I were thinking of investing in Groupon, one thing I’d be looking out for would be the quality of the merchants being featured. If it’s high or rising, that’s good news; if it’s low or falling, that’s bad news.Qualitative judgments, of course, aren’t particularly tractable, or easy to chart; analysts hate them. But ultimately the success of great companies like Apple comes down to precisely the quality of their products. And that’s something that might well end up determining the long-term fate of Groupon, too."

Friday, alone, had four dismal reports that could deflate Groupon’s IPO hopes.Wednesday’s Reports:WSJ: “Groupon Stumbles in China, Closes Some Offices”It isn’t just that the expansion in China hit a wall. It’s that Groupon’s rank in China is a distant 8, they’re handling the closures oddly (even closing one office at noon while office workers were at lunch) and their statements lack depth:Worrisome are those claims that “adjustments” are “very typical” and “China is just one example.”NYT: “Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Got a Deal for New York”Amazon's AmazonLocal is not just another competitor. It’s a popular company that has a huge 144 million customer base. Plus, the company has ample resources to fund expansion plans. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon has its own products that it can promote:Friday’s Reports:Now come the biggies…MSNBC – “How many Groupon rivals? Try 600” This article doesn't cover new ground, but it does deal with reality: The real-life ins and outs of running a coupon deal business today – even the question of whether there is a viable, long-term business model. In addition…Without patents, products, on-going revenues, or locked-in customers, Groupon must battle it out every day. Groupon may have name recognition, but consumers in search of deals will exhibit no loyalty if a competitor has a desirable coupon.WSJ – “Groupon Traffic Hits Summer Slump As Rival Gains – Hitwise”The results cited are disturbing on two levels. First, that Groupon’s traffic dropped 50%, while LivingSocial’s rose over 25%. (The period measured was mid-June through last week.) Second, that overall, industry traffic dropped 25%. The explanation offered, if true, heightens the uncertainty around what the WSJ calls “largely unproven businesses.”These data present a challenge in getting the IPO done. Usually, IPOs have financials showing a nice progression up to and including the most recent period. If Groupon is beginning to see some slowing or, worse, reversal, the IPO could be in trouble.Reuters - “Facebook ending Deals product after four-month test”One industry observer says Facebook’s exit is good news for Groupon and LivingSocial by reducing competition. The other interpretation is that Facebook’s active local business group found that the coupon deal business isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. This issue is addressed more in the following video…Bloomberg – “Groupon's Performance, IPO Outlook” (video)A Bloomberg report and interviews highlight the seriousness of Groupon’s problems. Especially important is the email from Groupon CEO Andrew Mason giving financial figures not in the SEC filing (this email was then leaked to the WSJ). This release of significant data or commentary is forbidden. (And remember Groupon has already been down this path once before. In mid-July they filed an amended IPO registration statement, adding that investors should ignore co-founder Eric Lefkofsky’s statement that Groupon would be ""wildly profitable.""This Bloomberg video piece explains the problem, bringing in some of Groupon’s other problems. It also includes a comment about the coupon deal business and Facebook’s decision to get out. The gist is that there are high marketing costs to sign up local businesses and handle all the interaction with the businesses and customers, including complaints and returns. (Groupon’s previous attempt to get investors to ignore those marketing costs could be taken as proof that Facebook, with proper GAAP accounting, saw a losing proposition.)First, because of the CEO's publicized email, we probably will see the SEC require another revised filing and likely a delay in the IPO's timing.Second, if the negative, fundamental issues revealed this week are not offset fairly quickly, the IPO price and/or size could be less than Groupon hoped for. If the negatives continue, the IPO could be unworkable.Regardless of what happens, I believe the best approach is to follow the Groupon story, but not invest. To me, the characteristics of the industry, the company and management make risk too high and return too uncertain. I think there’s more value from Groupon as a case study investigation than as a common stock investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Groupon came under fire from investors and the SEC for  highlighting the unusual measure as a key metric.  Wednesday's amended  filing relegates the ACSOI to a single mention in the CEO's open letter  as an internally tracked metric.Groupon,  although still unprofitable on a net income basis, reported improved  results for the second quarter of 2011.  The company reported $878  million in revenue, up 36% from 1Q11 and an incredible 906% from the  year-ago period.  Groupon had 116 million subscribers at the end of the  second quarter, an increase of 39% from 1Q11, but the average revenue  per subscriber fell to $9 from $10 in the last quarter, suggesting that  customer loyalty may still be a challenge.  Groupon's operating loss  narrowed to $103 million from $117 million in 1Q11, bolstered by an 18%  sequential drop in marketing expense, and partly offset by significant  investments in new initiatives, including Groupon NOW, Groupon Live and  Groupon Getaways.The latest results show that Groupon is still growing. However,  profitability may remain elusive for some time as the company continues  to pour money into its growth.Groupon originally filed with the SEC  to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering this past  June.  The Chicago, IL,-based company plans to list under the symbol GRPN.  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are the  lead underwriters on the deal.

278192,21718,2011-07-06T11:17:15-04:00,,"The value to merchants of voucher services such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) appears to  diminish over time, calling into question whether Groupon can sustain  its explosive growth rate, margins and valuation.A paper from Harvard Business School “reveals that a discount voucher  service is more likely to be profitable for affiliated firms, all else  equal, if customers using that service have valuations substantially  different from (and in particular, below) those of other customers. But  notice the difficulty as the voucher service grows: As more consumers  use vouchers, voucher-users necessarily come to resemble average  consumers so the use of a voucher comes to convey less information  about a consumer’s valuation. Thus, as voucher services grow, their  affiliates will have to rely on voucher advertising rather than voucher  price discrimination.”More excerpts from To Groupon or Not to Groupon: The Profitability of Deep Discounts by Benjamin Edelman Sonia Jaffe Scott Duke Kominers (free pdf download)Meanwhile, we are struck by the large fees that leading discount  voucher services charge to participating firms. Groupon charges 50% of  voucher price: if a restaurant offers a $20 voucher for $40 of food,  Groupon retains $10—a large fee relative to Groupon’s marginal costs of  voucher provision. . .  such large fees may impede firms’ usage of  discount vouchers. However, competition among discount voucher services  may drive down these fees.Meanwhile, we have noticed sharp price increases at several local  restaurants that offer frequent discounts through discount voucher  services. Visiting one such restaurant, we noticed that at least half of  consumers paid with a discount voucher. Vouchers have noticeably  increased the restaurant’s traffic, yet at prices (net of voucher  services’ fees, even bearing in mind the price increase) that surely  reduce the restaurant’s margins. We doubt the restaurant would have  enjoyed a similar traffic increase had it simply lowered its prices 25%;  clearly vouchers play an important role in making consumers aware of  discounts. Yet with voucher services retaining as much as half the  consumer’s prepayment, heavy reliance on discount voucher marketing  comes at a significant cost.Firms would do well to assess whether their voucher-using customers  have already visited and previously paid full price. Firms should also  measure how many voucher- using customers later come back without  vouchers. In principle, credit card systems could track this information  with little harm to customer privacy or data security. But in practice,  most firms currently lack the tools or expertise to run such analyses."

279693,22762,2011-07-15T14:54:55-04:00,,"By Rocky AgrawalGroupon’s (NASDAQ:GRPN) amended S-1  IPO filing is out. The revised filing tamps down some of the  enthusiastic tone of the original and highlights a number of risks,  several of which were covered in TechCrunch’s in-depth series on daily  deals.Potential investors looking for good news will be disappointed—I  didn’t see anything in the document that would lead me to believe the  business is any better than I’ve written before.Among the highlights:Controversial accounting metric de-emphasized. Groupon’s  filings use a non-standard metric called Adjusted Consolidated Segment  Operating Income. To arrive at this, Groupon takes the revenue generated  by a deal and subtracts only the money paid to the merchant.  Significant costs like subscriber acquisition, marketing and sales are  ignored. I describe it as “the best possible way to view our business if  you took out all of the things that make it look terrible.” The revised  S-1 walks back its importance. “We believe Adjusted CSOI is an  important measure of the performance of our business” has been revised  to ”We believe Adjusted CSOI is an important measure for management to evaluate the performance of our business.” Later, it says, “We do not view Adjusted CSOI as a valuation metric.”Gift card laws and compliance. In the revised S-1,  Groupon states “Groupons generally are included within the definition of  “gift cards” in many of these laws,” an issue I reported on previously. Groupon  updates the risk section to include the possibility that Groupon or  merchants may in some states be on the hook for the full value  (including promotional discount) of the Groupon for years or  indefinitely. Unlike retailers who issue gift cards, Groupon does not  record Groupon issuance as a liability. (Technically, Groupon considers  itself a marketing agent and the Groupon is really issued by the  merchant.) This presents a significant risk for investors. Further, many  merchants use Groupons as an introductory promotion to build a book of  business; if they become aware that they may be on the hook for Groupons  indefinitely, there is an increased likelihood that they won’t issue  Groupons. “In addition, we have received inquiries from the attorneys  general of various states regarding the operation of our business under  state laws.” Connecticut’s attorney general is among them.Calling out impact of international growth. Much of  Groupon’s revenue growth has been the result of international expansion,  not organic growth in existing markets. “The increase in our revenue,  key operating metrics and employee headcount from 2009 to 2010 is  partially attributable to these acquisitions and the subsequent growth  of our International segment as a result of such  acquisitions.” International growth is also very important to Groupon  for cash flow. In the U.S. and Canada, Groupon pays businesses within 60  days of the Groupon run. Elsewhere, merchants are paid as Groupons are  redeemed. As a result, Groupon can hold on to that cash much longer.  Groupons gross margins are higher internationally and Groupon also  benefits from unredeemed Groupons. (In the U.S. and Canada, the merchant  benefits.)National deals. Groupon specifically acknowledges  that national deals are offered at lower margins. “Gross profit is  influenced by the mix of national and local deals we offer. We tend to  accept lower gross profit margins for national deals because such offers  are made, in part, for the purpose of acquiring new subscribers and  establishing our brand.”Deal mix. The revised S-1 shows the deal types split  between North America and International and the results are very  different. For example, food and drink was 29% of deals in North America  and 19% internationally. Retail was 16% in North America and 4%  internationally. The data are reported in an opaque way making deeper  analysis difficult. But food and drink and retail are the toughest  categories for merchants to make profitable using Groupons. But they’re  also the categories that sell the best.No longer “wildy profitable”. Groupon says that a Bloomberg report  that Groupon co-founder and Executive Chairman Lefkofsky said  ”Groupon  was going to be wildly profitable” does not “accurately or completely”  reflect his views. (Bloomberg stands by its story.)Employees. In less than 45 days, the company has grown from “over 7,000 employees” to “over 9,000 employees”.General softening. Several sentences were added  softening the S-1. “We had net income of $21,000 for the second quarter  of 2009 as compared to a net loss of $102.7 million for the first  quarter of 2011. ” The data was already in the S-1 before, it has just  been made more obvious. Another addition: “As a result of our limited  operating history in a new industry and because the majority of our  subscribers registered for our service or made their initial purchase of  a Groupon in the past 12 months, it is difficult to discern meaningful  or established trends with respect to the purchase activity of our  subscribers or customers. ” A letter from Andrew Mason has been moved  from the front of the S-1 to page 32 and now says, “As with any business  in a 30-month-old industry, success for our investors is not  guaranteed. We have yet to reach sustained profitability and we have no  shortage of competition. Our path will include some moments of  brilliance and others of sheer stupidity.”A whole lot of beans to count. Starbucks chief Howard Schultz will make $200,000 a year and get 60,000 stock options for serving on Groupon’s board.Despite all of these changes, the S-1 doesn’t address the things I  most want to know. There are a number of key metrics that should be  known to the company that I’d want insight on before investing:Email subscriptions and open rates. What is the  trend in email open rates? Are emails being opened more or less  frequently? A decline in email open rates would indicate deal fatigue on  the part of consumers or a decline in deal quality for consumers. The  rapid growth in subscriptions can also hide the people who have dropped  out. What is the unsubscription rate? Companies like Netflix report  churn and it would be useful to have the data here.Fraud and refund rates. The S-1 makes scant  references to fraud and refunds, though it does show reserves of about  4% of revenue for refunds. Given their generous refund policies and a  strong focus on small businesses, this can present a significant risk to  investors. Small businesses are subject to failure and Groupon’s  expensive merchant terms result in a big risk of adverse selection. To  date, Groupon has refunded money to consumers who have had difficulty redeeming vouchers.What proportion of their subscription list was “bought” and hasn’t returned. Just  like small businesses who use Groupons to draw customers in with  amazing prices, daily deal providers occasionally subsidize deals for  customer acquisition. Deals for things like Amazon gift cards and movie  tickets are often subsidized by the deal providers. This can work as  long as those customers continue to purchase. But if they don’t make  further purchases, it’s just a loss. Those deals are also expensive  because it’s virtually guaranteed that existing customers will buy them.Subscriber and customer acquisition costs and their trends. These  are critical metrics to understand whether Groupon can be profitable in  the long term. If customers can’t be acquired for less than their  value, that’s a problem. I would expect that these costs go up over time  as the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. The S-1 mentions that  high acquisition costs are a concern but doesn’t directly provide them.   Doing the math based on other numbers provided, I estimate the cost of  a list subscriber at $6.40 and the cost of an actual purchaser at  $26.50. That’s a big number for a business with few barriers to entry.  For Netflix, this number is $18.03—but Netflix has a subscription  business with recurring revenue.Revenue by deal type. Groupon runs deals across a  wide range of categories. For some businesses, the underlying economics  work. For others, they don’t work. If most of the revenue is coming from  restaurant deals, that would raise serious red flags. If revenue is  predominantly from events, that’s a good sign. (Some of this can be  estimated from external sources, but it would be good to have validated  data.) The revised S-1 has charts that shows breakdown of types, but it  doesn’t provide revenue.Voucher redemption rates. These are going to be  imperfect due to poor tracking technology. But for businesses that are  doing online tracking, it would be useful to have the data. It could be  used to estimate any potential risk if states hold Groupon responsible  for compliance with gift card laws.Proportion of deals purchased by high volume customers. Groupon  is selling businesses on the value proposition of customer  acquisition—that all they have to do is show off how great they are and  customers will come back. But if deals are primarily purchased by deal  seekers, it may not really be in the business’ control whether they come  back. Over time, businesses would stop running Groupons if they knew  that they had no shot at converting a customer. Cheapskates are not good  acquisition targets for most businesses. (Except for Groupon and its  many clones.)A statement on risk management practices. In North  America, Groupon is essentially in the factoring business. Credit risk  management is important to being successful. Take on too much credit  risk and the company could face a lot of problems. As far as I have been  able to determine, the daily deal companies are not sufficiently  vetting credit risk.Split between national/regional and local deals. National  merchants will likely provide a lower share of revenue to Groupon than  local merchants and will generally be more sophisticated about the  structure of the offer. A higher portion of national merchants will  results in margin compression (the amended S-1 notes that national deals  do indeed have lower margins). The trend line on this split is also  important. My observations indicate that deals are trending more  national.Of course, no company will provide all of these things. But an  informed investor might want to ask these questions before buying the  stock or projecting Groupon’s current growth forward indefinitely.Original Post"
277825,22762,2011-07-04T06:42:32-04:00,,"By Vinicius VacantiIf you watch the nightly news, you would assume there’s a murder on every block, and if you’ve been reading TechCrunch recently, you would assume Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is murdering a small business in every city.Given the hundreds of thousands of merchants who have run daily deals in the past year, it is inevitable that a few will have had bad experiences. However, to assume that a handful of these anecdotes fully represent merchants’ experiences with daily deals is insufficient and irresponsible.A series of guest blog posts by Rocky Agrawal criticize daily deals, advising small businesses to stay away based on examples of where the deals fail to turn a profit for the businesses. While Rocky’s posts are surely well-intentioned, his evidence is largely based on a few anecdotes and a basic misunderstanding of daily deal economics.As we detail in Yipit’s Daily Deal Industry Report based on more than 100,000 past deals, 43% of offers in May involved merchants running a deal for at least their second time. Can so many merchants be delusional? Clearly some merchants have figured it out.While I understand and applaud Rocky’s motivation to protect small businesses, can those businesses really afford to ignore a marketing channel that can deliver hundreds, if not thousands of new customers in a cost per acquisition model? Not only are most small businesses struggling, their standard marketing channels of yellow pages and newspapers are becoming less and less effective.Instead of telling small businesses to avoid daily deals, how about trying to understand why some small businesses are having success?With that understanding, we could then educate other small businesses on how they might be able to replicate that success themselves.It’s a Numbers GameLike most marketing options, daily deals comes down to the numbers. The good news is that most of the key variables that affect the success of a daily deal experience can be optimized by small businesses via daily deal structure and execution.My co-founder, Jim Moran, wrote a post on the economics of a daily deal including a calculator. While this calculator bakes in a lot of assumptions, it’s the start of a handy tool for small businesses.The two most important variables that small businesses can optimize are:Overage: This metric represents how much more revenue the customer generates for the business than the value of the coupon. The larger the overage, the better for the small business. There are many things small businesses can do to increase overage including:Return Rate: This metric represents what percentage of customers come back as a regular customer after using a daily deal. Improving this metric has the potential to deliver the most value for small businesses as indicated by the calculator referenced above. In a report authored by Rice University, often cited as a reason daily deals are challenging, small businesses reported that 20% of customers came back. That’s actually huge! If a company runs a deal that sells 1,000 vouchers, 200 customers will come back. As the calculator above implies, that’s a high enough return rate to make the deals very successful for most small businesses. To improve return rates even further, small businesses can:Other factors that improve the economics of a daily deal:If small businesses focus on creating the right structure for their daily deal to increase overage and execute on the daily deal experience to increase return rates, daily deals can become a very attractive marketing option.Not right for everyoneThat being said, daily deals in their current form are not right for every business. The vast majority of deals are for spas, salons, restaurants, events, activities and other services. These merchants all have a large fixed cost base, perishable inventory and considerably lower variable costs. Accordingly, their marginal cost on an additional customer is low enough allowing them to discount aggressively. That’s why businesses have been offering discounts for hundreds of years.On the other hand, traditional retail categories appear the least frequently across the Yipit database, representing less than 10% of all offers.A powerful tool that shouldn’t be ignoredDaily deals represent a powerful, scalable new cost-per-acquisition marketing channel that small businesses can optimize via strategic pricing and good execution.If we really want to help small businesses, we should stop telling them to avoid daily deals. Instead, let’s focus our energy on educating small businesses on how they might be able to effectively take advantage of this new marketing channel. Or, I guess we can just keep directing them to yellow pages advertising.Editor’s note: This post is a response to our guest series taking a critical look at the daily deals industry. It is written by Vinicius Vacanti, CEO of Yipit, a daily deal aggregator that collects deals from more than 300 daily deal sites. Original post"
286324,22762,2011-08-10T10:59:28-04:00,,"By Robin WautersDaily deals juggernaut Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) managed to significantly slash marketing costs last quarter, but its net loss in the second quarter of this year has almost tripled compared to last year as it hired more than 1,000 new employees, according to an SEC filing published this morning. Basically, the company is still growing like gangbusters but losing money like crazy in the process.The updated financial details show that Groupon increased revenue from $3.3 million in Q2 2009 to $878 million in the second quarter of 2011, while net income swung from $21,000 for the second quarter of 2009 to a staggering net loss of $102.7 million for the second quarter of 2011.The reported net loss is in line with the first quarter of 2011 but nearly triple the $36 million loss from Q2 2010. Groupon hired more than 1,000 employees in the 3-month period – growing its sales force to more than 4,800 people – which caused a serious bump in ‘general and administrative expenses’.In total, Groupon grew from 37 employees as of June 2009 to 9,625 employees as of June 2011.Groupon serves 175 North American markets and 45 countries as of June 30, 2011. The company accounted for 115.7 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter of 2011 and says over 23 million customers have purchased Groupons through the end of Q2 2011.Marketing costs dropped to a little over to $170 million in Q2 2011, whereas Groupon spent $208 million on marketing during the first quarter of 2011.Interestingly, the company removed its controversial revenue calculation of gross revenues. As expected, the company stopped referring to a measurement called Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income (ACSOI), a metric that excludes marketing costs as well as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related items.We’re still going over the rest of the amended filing – there may be more updates.Two months ago, Groupon filed an S-1 to IPO, looking to raise at least $750 million.Story to be continued, obviously.Original post"
282135,24318,2011-07-27T09:25:47-04:00,,"While it might be cool to get a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) discount for its upcoming IPO, that’s probably not going to happen - for good reason, too, since this is likely to be another hot IPO issue. Loyal users rave about the company as if they fear they won’t get another Groupon email tomorrow.The controversy about the company has only continued to heat up. So what’s all the IPO hype about? Basically, the investment world is torn in half. One camp thinks the company is literally worth less than the free email they send you, but the other camp thinks Groupon is the best since sliced bread.We do love a great, opinionated  debate, but in the case of Groupon, it’s the numbers that best describe the true potential of the firm. According to the firm’s S-1 statement filed with the SEC, the company is on fire in terms of revenue growth. We can already hear the bears screaming about how the firm will never be profitable, but here after checking the firm’s statements, we disagree.If you think Groupon is all the rage only in the U.S. we have some news for you. Groupon has far bigger plans than just the good ol’ USA. Next in line is LivingSocial, which is trying to unseat the king of daily-deal emails. While Groupon still hasn’t gone public, we still rate it a BUY. We like the firm’s global approach, we believe that profitability is only a matter of time, and we don’t think it’s a zero-sum game with respect to competition from Living Social.Don’t Be Misled by Numbers at Face ValueIs Groupon unprofitable? It sure is. But does that matter in the long term? Not really. This is all a matter of perception. When we dig into the numbers, we see that the vast majority of losses come from abroad. U.S. operations lost only $10.4 million last year, whereas the international operations lost $170.6 million. So, if the firm is losing a good chunk of change abroad, how can it become profitable?  Well for 2010, year-over-year gross profit growth was 24,600 percent, reaching $280 million. In Q12011, the firm already achieved an impressive $270 million. What all this really means to us is that, if Groupon can just improve its expense management more efficiently, it could easily achieve profitability.Go Global or FailOne of the most intriguing points about Groupon is its aggressive international expansion. While most firms wouldn’t seriously consider projection abroad until they saturate the domestic market, Groupon broke that protocol. Why is this significant? To be candid, Groupon isn’t the most innovative idea and copycat firms have little barrier to entry. We like that they are cutting off potential competition in lucrative foreign markets before it can even crop up. This allows the firm to geographically diversify its revenue from the recovering U.S. economy. Emerging markets come to mind, anyone? In the simplest terms, “The best defense is an explosive offense.” In a world that is truly globalized, anything less would be very disappointing.Call to ActionUnfortunately Groupon isn’t going to IPO tomorrow. Will it price high? Potentially – and, again, that’s open to personal interpretation. Regardless, we think Groupon could be a great name to buy even if it comes out on the high end. Why?               The firm’s service is slowly becoming part of people’s everyday lives and this means it has disruptive potential. Not to mention it looks like this firm took a page right out of OpenTable’s (NASDAQ:OPEN) successful playbook by offering a small share float and we know how that story ended for investors who weren't greedy. In the meantime, for those interested in a speculative tech firm with a huge amount of potential, it’s time to start saving those pennies for some risk capital that can be deployed on Groupon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

It’s a  great example of overstretch and dubious logic, with a couple of moments  of brilliance and genuine insight thrown in at the same time. Groupon,  of course, being in its quiet period, can’t react. Except, it just can’t  help itself, and has put up a whiny post, supposedly authored by the company cat, about how unfair the whole situation is.The fact is that when Groupon made the decision to go public, it  invited exactly this kind of attention — both before the IPO and forever  more. When Groupon was private, no one really knew anything about its  financials, and CEO Andrew Mason could happily declare that he’d much rather  talk about building miniature dollhouses. Once it’s public, however,  he’ll have a fiduciary responsibility to his shareholders, and will have  to answer such questions at length. Will that make him happier than  answering such questions with a death-ray stare?  I doubt it, to be honest. Revenues and business models and profits and  forecasts are serious things, and you can’t kid around with shareholders  in the same way you can with journalists.In other words, Mason will have to go from saying nothing, which can be fun, to saying something,  which almost certainly won’t be. Rather than moan about his inability  to say anything in the quiet period, he should enjoy it while it lasts.  From now on in, the boring financial questions are going to be  unavoidable — from analysts, from journalists, from shareholders, even  probably from merchants and customers who wonder whether Groupon’s  profitability is a sign that they’re being ripped off.Which brings me to one of Agrawal’s smartest points:The reason that Groupon can get away with retaining 50% of the  proceeds of its offers is precisely because the supply of those offers  is so constrained that demand will always exceed it. Groupon can then  pick and choose among the various different merchants clamoring to do  business with it, aiming to maximize its own revenues by selecting the  offers which are most lucrative for Groupon.In this, Groupon’s interests are not aligned with either merchants or  consumers. With merchants, indeed, the interests are almost  diametrically opposed: the greater the proportion of total revenues that  Groupon takes, the less well the merchant does. And consumers will  always prefer an offer with a low up-front cost, while Groupon wants to  maximize the up-front spend, since that’s all that Groupon ever sees.Up until now, there’s been one overriding narrative when it comes to  Groupon: its astonishing, breakneck rate of growth. The secondary story  was the quirkiness of the place, and its sense of humor. And I’m sure  that from the company’s point of view there’s something frustrating  about running into its first real barrage of negative press just when it  can’t respond at all. But my guess is that it won’t take long before  executives look back wistfully on these quiet days. Because the  aggressive questions aren’t going away — and the questioners are never  going to be satisfied with Groupon’s answers, either."
275595,22762,2011-06-19T10:41:32-04:00,,"By Carey M. FriedmanEditor’s note: Carey Friedman is the proud owner of Grandpa Eddie’s BBQ in Richmond, VA. This post is in response to a guest series on TechCrunch taking a critical look at Groupon’s business model. I’ve been reading a lot of stories on TechCrunch lately coming down hard on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and, like other happy Groupon merchants, I wasn’t going to comment because I thought it was a single story with one author’s thoughts. However, after seeing story after story trying to pick apart every single piece of Groupon, I felt it necessary to write about my experience. I’m also hoping that I’m the first BBQ restaurant owner to write for TechCrunch.I had tried almost every other form of advertising in the past with varying degrees of success. Then our Groupon sales rep contacted me. I had heard about similar deals before and had turned down the offers. However, Groupon offered me something different. At the time, there were 86,000 people signed up for Richmond’s Groupon list (many more now). After she explained the details, how everything worked and what to expect, I ran the numbers on the discount and wanted to give it a try. There is no better way to get almost 90,000 unique impressions for so little cost. We ran our first deal in December of 2010 and sold 1,184 Groupons.Let me say this loud and clear—for my business Groupon has worked incredibly well. The first deal I ran was $10 for $20 worth of food and drink. I was told to expect nearly a thousand deals sold and was pleasantly surprised that we sold nearly 1,200. Of those 1,200 customers, we found that 70% of them were new customers, a great average right off the bat. Of those 800+ new customers, we have seen more than half of them return. Also, let’s not forget all the people who came into my restaurant in the weeks following the Groupon deal and told me that they saw my business on Groupon, missed the deal, but still came anyway because they wanted to try out a new restaurant. That kind of exposure for a small business is invaluable! We were seen by tens of thousands of potential customers in our area and that didn’t cost a dime!Now, back to the Groupon customers. We tracked every Groupon redemption on our point of sale (POS) system and found that only a handful (literally five or six), had a ticket total that was under the price of the Groupon ($20). We found that customers, on average, spent at least $12 on top of the price of the Groupon, and that was before they came back and paid full price (most more than once). And this is at a BBQ restaurant! One consistent factor has been that Groupon customers are much more likely to add an appetizer or dessert to their check, since they know the first $20 only cost them $10. This has been a wonderful way to not only up the ticket average on the redemption, but also has given the customers a broader taste of our menu. When they come back without the Groupon, they are more likely to order that extra item again. Also, I found Groupon customers to be better than the average “coupon” customer. These are people that were interested in trying a new restaurant and open to the idea of coming back. There was only a small percentage of guests who were just looking for a bargain.Another number that I track, which many other restaurants do not, is what my employees claimed on tips. It gives me a good idea of the overall traffic in my restaurant and how confident my customers are with the economy. From my experiences over the past 29 years in the industry, when the economy is rough, tips are one of the first things to take a hit. During the first quarter of 2011 my employees claimed over $4,000 more in tips than the same period in 2010. This was during the first three months of our redemption period and was by far the highest volume of Groupons. It is indisputable that Groupon brought the vast majority of these customers to our door. Groupon customers were some of our best tippers and nearly always, almost without fault, tipped on the total bill, not the discounted check.One of the best reasons I found to use Groupon is that it’s trackable. Buying a newspaper ad doesn’t allow you to see who’s coming in as a result. With Groupon, you can see your marketing dollars at work and have the chance to convert Groupon customers to regulars, something we’ve done a lot. My employees were thrilled when we ran the deal because we were always busy and that’s a good thing. Our bottom line has been raised significantly and I owe a lot of that to Groupon.Please don’t dismiss this story as an anomaly. I have recommended Groupon to other small business owners, some of whom have run deals with Groupon and done very well (Havana Connections in Richmond for one). The positive stories are out there in abundance, even though we may not yell as loud or as frequently as others.Will everyone succeed using Groupon? Probably not. As a business owner, I feel like it’s my responsibility to look at this marketing tool and see if it works for my business. There is no question that it has paid for itself better than any other advertising medium we have ever used. The Groupon sales reps have been extremely helpful in telling me what to expect and how to prepare as well. For me, and, I suspect many other small business owners, this is a no brainer. For the money I spent on the discount, not only was I able to get my message out to almost 90,000 separate individuals, but I was easily able to capitalize on this and turn many of the guests into regular customers. Where else can a small business get that kind of marketing access? The simple answer is nowhere.I am now running my second Groupon deal, and launched it on the exact day that the first offer expired. We sold over 1730 Groupons, even more than the first time.Original post"
275301,20991,2011-06-16T15:00:29-04:00,,"Benjamin Edelman and Paul Kominers  have a fantastic post up about the various legal pitfalls facing  Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and other coupon sites: there are more of them than you might  think. In many states, for instance, it’s illegal to offer discounts on  alcohol, yet Groupon merchants do so anyway. In others, coupons need to  have a 5-year expiration, rather than the much shorter ones found on  most Groupons; it’s not enough just to offer the consumer’s money back  for that long. Elsewhere, people redeeming coupons for less than the  face value are required to get the difference back in cash. And it’s  also quite common for merchants to need to hand over to the state any  money they got from expired coupons.And then there’s the question of sales tax. Let’s say I spend $20 for  a $40-face-value Groupon at a restaurant. I rack up a $60 bill, before  tax and tip, and the check arrives, charging me $65.32 after adding  8.875% sales tax. I hand over a Groupon and a credit card, and my card  gets charged the difference, of $25.32; I then add a tip on the $60  amount. So far so normal.But in fact, once I hand over the Groupon, the sales tax should be  recalculated — this according to unanimous advice from various state  authorities. Rather than charging tax on $60, the tax should be  calculated only on the post-coupon amount of $20, and the check total  should be $21.77.This is in fact the amount of tax the restaurant pays — when doing  its taxes, the restaurant adds up its cash receipts and calculates the  total tax due. It doesn’t include coupons. So the extra tax — in this  case $3.55, or 8.875% of $40 — is essentially a hidden gift which goes  directly to the restaurant. (But not to the server! So don’t use this as  an excuse to tip less!)Those sales-tax amounts quickly add up:The big picture here is that Groupon and other coupon sites are being  unreasonably aggressive in trying to slough off legal responsibility  for these issues onto their merchants. This bit is worth quoting at  length:Andrew Mason, Groupon’s CEO, is the smiling face of customer service  which exceeds expectations and keeps everybody — customers and merchants  alike — happy. So it’s worrying to me that he’s set up his company in  such a manner as to make it seem that these important legal issues are  not his problem. Groupon is swimming in money these days: it should  spend some of its millions on some decent lawyers and set a high  standard in such areas for copycat sites to match. Otherwise its  much-vaunted customer service looks as though it’s entirely cosmetic,  and serves to disguise the fact that Groupon is helping merchants flout  consumer-protection laws across the country.Disclosure: No positions"
274808,23864,2011-06-14T11:21:43-04:00,,"By Kerri ShannonGroupon Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) will try to get you to jump on its initial public offering  by   touting its extreme growth and its profit potential -- but don't believe   it.  Even though Chicago-based Groupon, an e-commerce player that offers   daily discounts to subscribers via e-mail, has exploded since it entered  the  online coupon world in 2008, that growth is threatened by the  company's  competition and mounting losses.""The market opportunity isn't as big as the industry players  would like  you to believe,"" Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester  Research  Inc. (NASDAQ:FORR) wrote  in an open letter to investors considering Groupon.  ""This IPO game isn't  about finding value, it's about finding a greater  fool who actually believes  the valuation is true. Trust me, you  will  be the fool.""Here's why buying into what Groupon's saying about its  profitability is a foolish move. Groupon filed its Form S-1 registration statement  with the SEC on June 2, listing its value at $750 million, but  some say it  could raise as much as $3 billion, valuing the company at $30  billion.  That's even more than the $27 billion debut of Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in August 2004.That's also five times as high as the $6 billion takeover  bid Google  offered Groupon in December 2010 -- a huge jump many analysts can't   explain. ""There is no rational math that  could possibly get anyone to the valuation Groupon thinks it deserves,"" said  Mulpuru.Groupon cites soaring growth as  the reason for its high value. It sts 83 million  subscribers -- a 54,505% increase from 152,000 in mid-2009.  Groupon's sales also have increased. The company doled out  28.1 million  coupons in just the first quarter of 2011, compared to 30.3  million in  all of 2010.But many analysts believe Groupon's days of explosive growth  are over.  ""[S]uch growth just can't continue at that pace,"" said Wall  Street Daily's chief investment strategist and IPO expert Louis  Basenese. ""It's  simply not possible given a limited market opportunity. And  that's  particularly true in this case, considering all the competition that's   knocking on the door.""Groupon may have started the online coupon trend, but now  hundreds of competitors have flooded the market. Websites like LivingSocial.com, Dealfind.com and BuyWithMe.com attract subscribers from  Groupon's market share.There are already signs of a less-active subscriber base in  the  conversion ratios -- a signal that some of Groupon's customers have  already  started to defect. Of Groupon's 83 million subscribers, only 15.8 million have  made a  purchase. Comparing Groupon's sales to its subscriber gains means it   only sold 34 Groupon deals per 100 subscribers, down from 69 deals per  100  subscribers in 2009.And Groupon offers no competitive advantage to keep its  subscribers from flocking to the competition. ""There's no proprietary technology, or cutting-edge  innovation, or  critical and exclusive relationships helping Groupon stand out  from the  crowd,"" said Basenese.Indeed, there's no proof Groupon will maintain its top spot  among  determined competitors - despite how much it's spending to acquire and   keep customers.Sky-High LossesGroupon scored revenue of $94 million in 2008, which swelled to $713  million by 2010. Groupon's revenue hit $644.7 million in the  first  quarter of 2011. But slicing away at Groupon's earnings are staggering losses  and steep marketing expenses. The company posted a loss of $456 million, or $2.66 a share,  for 2010.  That's up from $6.9 million in 2009 and $2.2 million in 2008. It lost   $147 million, or 95 cents a share, in the first quarter this year. Since 2008, losses total $540.2 million, which is not an  easy number for investors to stomach.""To lose this money? What's crazy about these numbers is  that this  should be a highly profitable model,"" said Forrester Research's   Mulpuru. ""This is fundamentally a decent economic model;  there are no   expensive fixed costs and the merchant bears the inventory risk.""Groupon is also spending a great deal on marketing. The  company spent  $263.2 million on advertising and subscriber e-mails in 2010, up  from  $4.5 million in 2009. Groupon's marketing costs hit $208.2 million in  this  year's first quarter. The company says  the marketing budget will  dwindle over time, along with the cost to maintain  subscribers.Groupon argues that its heavy spending on marketing is a  one-time  expense to secure a dominant market share ahead of competitors. CEO Andrew Mason wrote in the SEC filing that despite high   losses, Groupon still has amazing profit potential -- if investors have  the  patience and faith to stick around:But analysts aren't so sure those ""ambitious bets"" will ever  pay off. ""It's not yet clear what their longer-term margins will be  or when they  will be able to get to consistent profitability,"" A.B. Mendez, a   research analyst at GreenCrest Capital Management LLC, told Bloomberg News.Sit This One Out  Groupon hopes to capitalize on investors' eagerness to find  the next big tech stock. ""They'll call it good timing; I'll call it greed,"" said Wall  Street Daily's  Basenese. ""Management wants to tap into investor  enthusiasm for tech  IPOs while it's running high. Otherwise they risk leaving  money on the  table.""Most analysts agree that investors looking to cash in on the  tech trend should wait for an opportunity other than Groupon. ""There will be plenty more IPOs coming up of companies with  greater  profitability and higher barriers to entry (e.g. social networks with   hundreds of millions of followers),"" said Forrester's Mulpuru. ""Those  will be wiser investments. Give  Groupon time to actually earn its  valuation.""Those slated to join the Internet IPO club in coming months  include gaming site Zynga  Game Network Inc., which could be valued as much as $10 billion; social  networker Twitter Inc.; and the one many are waiting for, Facebook Inc., which is  expected to file by next year and could be valued as high as $80 billion.Basenese suggested investors wait for a company that has a  more solid  plan for profits than does Groupon. Those who don't could end up  making  the same mistake many investors did during the dot-com bubble in 2000. ""Focus on revenue and profitability,"" said Basenese.  ""Research out of the University of Florida demonstrates companies with at least $50 million in sales (for the trailing twelve months)   and profits at the time of an IPO tend to outperform in the after  market. During  the last tech-driven IPO craze in 1999, most IPOs did  not possess those two  characteristics. And no surprise, most ultimately  flopped.""Disclosure: NoneOriginal post"
274681,22031,2011-06-13T16:38:12-04:00,,"The moment Groupon goes public later this year, it becomes a takeover target -- it can't happen too soon, given the latest turn of events. The daily deal wonder has effectively created a booming industry from scratch at a time when financially withering consumers are showing renewed reluctance to spend.While Groupon scrambles to innovate ahead of the pack and explain its creative accounting to prospective IPO investors, the biggest risk to its sustainability is the uncertain economy. What good are deals without buyers? Even as it plans to go public in a deal that could raise as much as $3 billion, giving it nearly a $30 billion valuation (more than what Google's IPO was worth in 2004, according to Bloomberg), Groupon fever is being dampened by sobering facts. Groupon's success depends on consumer discretionary spending. Although global Internet traffic is expected to quadruple by 2015 to nearly 3 billion people, or 40% of projected population according to Cisco (per Mashable), not everyone will be wildly spending online. Among the many alarming deteriorating statistics is a sharply widening gap between consumer discretionary spending and consumer staples. Put another way, the continued decline in household debt (steadily contracting since early 2008) indicates that consumers -- including the nation's 24 million underemployed and unemployed -- are struggling to pay off debt and save rather than spend to fuel economic growth. An eye-opening report by Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett, based on proprietary research, puts a fine point on such troubling economic trends. They have serious implications for media, cable and other related companies he tracks -- and most certainly for Groupon. The bottom 40% of U.S. households has already exhausted all of their disposable income, leaving nothing for discretionary cable, phone, clothing and debt service. While retailers and advertisers in general can play to the top 20% households (who account for 40% of retail spending), companies relying on universal economic support in highly competitive markets are headed for rough times. Groupon's typical age 18-to-34, female user (as defined by eMarketer) is hardly insulated, given that the U.S. youth unemployment rate stands at more than 18%, or double the overall rate. The current trending toward a second recessionary dip could see merchants avoiding subsequent deals and consumers unwilling to return to the deal well, except for the most relevant and justifiable reasons. Experts say there are signs that consumers suffering from deal fatigue are becoming more selective, and that only merchants with perishable inventories and a large fixed cost base are willing to engage in deep discounts. Increasingly, merchants prefer to more tightly control deals in their own space, on their own sites and apps. Some of this reality was reflected in Groupon's first quarter numbers. Revenue per Groupon deal fell 8.7% to $22.95 last quarter, compared to the prior year period. The number of Groupon deals per merchant declined 21% to $612 from the year-earlier period. Although Groupon reported $645 million in first quarter revenues, up 1457% from the previous year, its overall operating metrics are trending downward. Groupon's gross profits fell to 42% last quarter from 45.2% the first quarter of 2009, according to Wedbush Securities Internet analyst Lou Kerner. While LivingSocial is the only real close competitor, daily deals are destined to develop into more of a long tail endeavor that can be whittled away by companies of all size playing to their own loyal customer base and specialized needs. The daily deal space has been embraced by vertical deal sites (OpenTable), publishers like Daily Candy and The New York Times, consumer services (Gilt Groupe, TravelZoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), CityPockets, Lifesta) and aggregators such as Yipit. There is an active subset of exchanges that transfer daily deals from merchants to sales forces and publishers, and so-called white label providers focused on publishers with access to select consumers. Groupon is answering the onslaught by accelerating its acquisition and consolidation of smaller deal providers. It's aggressively marketing past the $263.2 million it spent in 2010 on online advertising and subscriber e-mails, compared with just $4.5 million the year before. Despite efforts to expand internationally, grab more real-time business with its new Groupon Now app, and move into new loyalty card memberships (to compete more directly with Foursquare), Groupon eventually may need to sell out to a dominant, broad-based player to remain relevant in a rapidly changing new market sector, Acquirers could include online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which just launched the members-only MyHabit deal-maker for designer duds, social media monster Facebook or advertising-based search giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which offered a measly $6 billion to acquire the Chicago-based company earlier this year). As Groupon's asking price swells, its market share is squeezed and constituents retreat in a slowing economy, leading players will seek less costly, organic ways to scale daily deals. The deal darling's vulnerability to deteriorating economics is being overlooked by the media in favor of more sexy issues, such as the apparent cashing out of key Groupon executives, including its largest shareholder and co-founding chairman, Eric P. Lefkofsky. He is the focus of an unflattering Fortune write-up that has fanned the flames over Groupon's financial soundness. Groupon's filing argues that its costs should more accurately be adjusted to exclude its exploding marketing costs, other future operating expenses and non-cash charges, since it is a growing concern. Analysts also have been quick to take Groupon to task for reporting first-quarter revenues of $645 million when the company only really pocketed $270 million due to its generally 50/50 split with merchants. In its SEC filing and amid declining margins, Groupon warns investors that it cannot guarantee it will be profitable any time soon. It lost $413 million in 2010 as it intensifies its marketing spend to grow its 83 million subscriber base. Ultimately, it will be up to Groupon to demonstrate that it can be more than a one-trick pony. LinkedIn and Facebook, which could be valued at around $80 billion as a public company, have much more defensible, unique value propositions and market shares. You don't need to look much past your own pocketbook for the answer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
275070,22762,2011-06-15T14:54:22-04:00,,"By Rocky AgrawalDaily deal providers like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and LivingSocial may be violating several key aspects of consumer protection law.I've been looking into issues like gift cards, bankruptcy, sales tax,  and alcohol regulations. These might all sound esoteric and not really  worthy of discussion, but the outcomes can significantly affect the  value proposition to the consumer, merchant and the deal provider. For  investors in the daily deal companies, these can affect stock  performance as well as legal liability.I had a conversation with Ben Edelman, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, about some of these issues. Ben and Paul Kominers of MIT published a paper yesterday on ""Consumer Protection in Online Discount Voucher Sales.""    When I asked him if he has any conflicts, he says he hasn't done any  paid consulting in the industry nor does he have any other conflicts of  interest.Because daily deal vouchers are new, in some cases the specific handling is unclear. In others, the law is clear cut.Gift cardsEveryone knows about gift cards. It's a $90 billion  business. Most people don't think ""gift card"" when purchasing a daily  deal from Groupon, LivingSocial, or the rest. But the law may see no  such distinction.The basic legal definition of a gift card varies by state,  but generally has all the same requirements as a daily deal. It is  prepaid, good for a predetermined value and can be redeemed for goods  or services at a specified business. Both Groupon and LivingSocial have already been sued under various state gift card statutes. One suit against Groupon was dismissed according to the Groupon blog.Because the consumer prepays for the vouchers, daily deals may be considered a gift card. Twenty seven states regulate gift cards.  Although most daily deal vouchers have an expiration date, this may be  against the law and the disclosures may violate state laws as well.  (Some states require that expiration dates be printed in a certain font  size, for example.) Many states have expiration dates that are  significantly longer than the six months or a year attached to daily  deals.In Massachusetts gift cards are valid for seven years  and are based on the face value of a gift card. So 6 years after buying  a $20 gift certificate for $10, the consumer could go to the merchant  and redeem it for the full $20. Washington requires that consumers be  able to use the remaining value on any gift card, which is something daily deal providers often prohibit. California requires that remaining value below $10 be returned to the consumer in cash.Groupon puts expiration dates on its deals, online and in print.  Groupon also sends out reminders when a Groupon is about to expire. In  the fine print, it states that any expiration is subject to provisions  of state law.In the states Edelman and Kominers looked at, it is largely unlawful  to ""sell"" gift certificates with the prohibited expiration dates. In  that case, voucher services could also be liable years later.In the U.S. and Canada, merchants benefit from Groupons that go  unused. Elsewhere, Groupon benefits. Daily deal companies sell breakage  on unredeemed vouchers as a benefit to merchants. (In fact, it may be  the only way a deal becomes profitable.) But the merchant may be on the  hook for redeeming the voucher long after the stated expiration date.  Having to cash out residual value also makes the economics worse for the  merchant. Because some merchants use daily deals as an introductory  offer to build a book of business, they may not be inclined to offer the  deals if the obligations extend for year.Merchant bankruptcyRunning a small business is tough. Many of them fail. It's important to know what happens when they do.Groupon's terms of service can be interpreted as the merchant is responsible for the delivery. The Groupon Promise  is pretty wide open and seems to say that Groupon will cover such  losses. Google Offers explicitly says in its terms of service that  Google is not responsible if a merchant goes under.I've been asking TechCrunch readers to share their experiences with  closed businesses. (Send them to dailydeals@agrawals.org) There have  been enough cases that this is clearly an important issue.From what I've heard, Groupon and Living Social have refunded money  when a business goes under. In some cases, they have been proactive and  sent emails telling people that a business has closed.That's great for consumers. But it should be a concern for investors because of the risks inherent in small businesses.Sales taxWhat's the correct sales tax on a $51 purchase with a $50 Groupon  that someone bought for $25 in a state with a 5% tax rate? The possible  answers are 5 cents, 68 cents, $1.30 and $2.55. That's based on a  taxable value of $1 (amount paid at point of sale), $13.50 (amount  merchant actually gets), $26 (total amount consumer paid) and $51 (total  face value of the transaction). I find that most businesses pick either  extreme.""It's like Goldilocks and the three bears,"" Edelman said. ""It has to  be just right."" Charge too little and states are deprived of much needed  tax revenue. Charge too much and the consumer loses. Both are unlawful,  Edelman said.Edelman and Kominers reviewed state laws in several states and found  that many call for tax only on the amount the consumer actually paid.  Edelman also wrote to the Department of Revenue of Massachusetts, which confirmed  that ""an online discount voucher is ""the equivalent of a cash discount  by the restaurant"" since the restaurant itself funds the totality of the  discount.If tax isn't collected correctly from the consumer, it can also  affect the profitability of the deal for the merchant and they could end  up paying taxes on money they never saw.If you have a receipt from a deals transaction, please scan and send  it to dailydeals@agrawals.org. If the state is not already printed on  it, please write it.AlcoholTwenty seven states restrict discounting on alcohol and the rules vary by state.  In Illinois, where Groupon is headquartered, merchants can't discount  alcohol to some patrons over others. Yet Edelman and Kominers found 87 Groupon vouchers in Chicago that mention ""beer"" in their descriptions and 252 that mention wine.TechCrunch readers may think these are silly laws that shouldn't be  enforced (I would tend to agree), but this significantly affects the  economics of the deal. It's often hard to find discounts on alcohol; I  was surprised to learn that I could use Groupons for drinks. I would buy  them for bars where I normally wouldn't eat. Enforcement of these rules  would lead to lower sales. It would also create greater complexity for  restaurants and bars in accepting vouchers. (But they would benefit from  full price sales of alcohol.)SummaryThese are a few of the regulations and laws that the deal providers  ignore. Edelman and Kominers track a few others such as escheat and  accountability.The deal providers have pushed the complexity of these laws onto the  merchants and consumers. Groupons come with generic disclaimers in  5-point type. (Edelman checked.)""Groupon asks individual merchants to figure out these questions for  themselves,"" Edelman said. He thinks that's a bad approach: ""By asking  merchants to do the work, Groupon effectively guarantees that the work  won't be done at all.""The ambiguity creates a bad customer-merchant dynamic. Jessie Burke's story  reached its boiling in a dispute with a customer who was trying to use  an expired Groupon. She later tried to research Oregon law, but says,  ""The onus of responsibility shouldn't be entirely on this little  business that doesn't know the laws in the first place.""Edelman agrees. He believes that the deal providers are in a much  better position to track these issues and educate the merchants. The  work could be done once for each state. He's already done a lot of the  work for them in his paper.Edelman would like to see more compliance with the laws and a clearer, more consistent message to the consumer. What the Groupon Promise gives with one hand, the terms of service takes away with the other.""From one perspective, the Groupon Promise is basically illusory,""  Edelman said. ""Groupon is likely to argue that it's just a statement of  their customer service plan, not their actual obligation. Meanwhile  their Terms of Service are much harsher and much less generous. That  kind of difference is the stuff of consumer class action lawsuits.""The consumers I've heard from have generally said positive things  about the customer service from Groupon. One wrote to say that Groupon  gave a refund for an unsatisfactory house cleaning. But merchants  grumble that daily deal providers make them out to be the bad guys.Original Post"
274523,21969,2011-06-13T07:53:11-04:00,,"The more I read about Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and its hyper-growth and rapid expansion, the more I kept thinking the story sounded familiar,  like someone I know had lived through it before ... and then I realized that someone was me.   A little more than a decade ago,  fresh out of college and ready to conquer the world,  I found myself squarely in the middle of the dot-com boom. I was determined to take advantage of the hysteria and used my experience (in retrospect I really knew absolutely nothing) to land a senior consultant role at Internet superstar, Commerce One.  A 20 billion dollar business-to-business (B2B) powerhouse at the time,  Commerce One built B2B exchanges in different vertical markets that allowed businesses to send ""transactions"" to one another.    These transactions could be any business related electronic document,  such as a purchase order, invoice or shipping notice.   Commerce One's model was to act sort of like a toll booth,  charging companies a fee as transactions passed through these exchanges and eventually expected to make billions collecting toll.I remember early on I was in a Commerce One corporate training class that outlined our business strategy and consulting approach for the professional services group that I was part of.   The room was filled with consultants in their 20's and 30's and from the idle chatter before class,  it seemed to be a brag-fest with everyone touting themselves as an expert in Internet commerce.  During a corporate training class, the 30-something instructor stopped the class without warning after getting a call on her cell and abruptly darted into the hallway.  I could see through the frosted glass door she was pacing back and forth wildly and in deep and semi-hysterical conversation.   I asked the colleague next to me (a veteran employee that had been there all of 9 months) what was going on.  He nonchalantly turned to me and said with a hint of arrogance:I thought he was joking and went about my business after calling him an idiot in my head.  After 15 minutes, the instructor came back in with an ear-to-ear grin and felt the need to share the news on how much she had pocketed.   My arrogant colleague looked at down his phone and programmed the brokers number into his speed dial.   Everyone around me starting jotting down notes on exercise prices and retirement projections.   Training ended early that day and no one in the class remembered a single word but ""millionaire.""A month later I was already drinking,  perhaps chugging, the Kool-Aid.   Fueling my attitude was the fact that my unvested options were now worth more than six-figures.   I ran into an acquaintance at a bar in Georgetown near where I was consulting for a client in DC.   Fresh out of Duke, he was in his early 20's and had landed a job as an Associate at the Carlyle Group in DC.   At that time,  even though Carlyle group was a prestigious firm with 100 billion in management,  it was also viewed as a institution with ""old school"" thinking that was aligned with fundamentals and slow steady growth.   Pretty much the opposite of the wild west mentality with Internet business models.   I sat down at a table with him to talk/brag about my new gig.   ""Commerce One keeps going up,  at this rate, it may end up being bigger than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),""  I said confidently.   He scoffed, and retorted back,  ""I don't think its going anywhere but down"".     As a Commerce One Kool-Aid drinker,  this view was blasphemy and I would have none of it.   I responded with a twinge of annoyance,   ""You probably just don't understand the business model,  let me explain it to you and you'll change your thinking,  How about I go over"".     He quickly interrupted me.  ""I know the business model, sell the software at a loss,   charge a few bucks per transaction and grow the number of transactions into billions"".      ""So what's the problem then?""  I asked.   He shook his head slightly,My heart skipped a beat,  out of pride,  I continued to banter for a few more minutes,  but I realized he was right ...  I thought I was the smartest guy in the room.   I wasn't even the smartest guy at the table.    A few months later the official implosion began and by the end of the year,  Commerce One had lost the vast majority of its 20 billion market cap and my naive dreams of retiring by 30 were appropriately dashed.In looking at Groupon hyper-growth and plans for greatness,  i see a number of parallels to dot com busts of the past:Customer Land Grab -   The idea of acquiring customers as quickly and aggressively as possible is very dangerous.   For Groupon,  they are trying to capitalize on a First-to-Market strategy and scaling the business at warp speed but with high overhead costs.   Groupon has managed to gain 15 million customers but accumulated a deficit of over $500 million dollars in the process.   If you do the math,  the acquisition costs seem to well outweigh the profits derived from the groupons themselves.  And why would anyone believe that any of these customers will be loyal in the long (or even short) term?      Every Groupon user I know personally has scaled back their use and that tends to happen after in-your-face overexposure.    Will consumers find Groupon any more interesting than Living Social, HomeRun,  Social Buy or the other myriad of deal-a-day sites?  I know I won't.Customer Fatigue -  I followed Groupon religiously for a few months,  and after a few wasted Groupons,  I use it about once every few months and most of my peers who use the service have similar usage patterns.   Also the 3 other deal-a-day sites that popped up with deals in my immediate area add to the fatigue.   Once the sentiment turns from highly enthusiastic to neutral and consumers are at peace with letting deals pass by,  the whole deal-a-day sector is in trouble.   Remember those mailers you get with a hundred coupons and you toss right in the trash?  What about woot.com or Amazon Gold Deals?   Do you visit those on any regular basis?    I didn't think so.Commoditization -  Groupon's  gross operating margin is still above 40%,  but I'm pretty sure its started it's downward spiral. With no barriers to entry,  well-funded competitors have peppered the landscape, and all players will be lucky if margins persist over 15% in the long term.   At 15% margins,  Groupon existence as a going concern is in serious jeopardy.   Look at restaurant.com,  its a fantastic service that gives deep discounts on local restaurant deals.   I don't have any visibility into their books,  but I doubt the owners of that site are billionaires.In a best case scenario,  these pressures will cause growth to stall ,  Groupon will adjust and adapt with a smaller footprint but will survive.   However, if the timing and scale of these pressures plays out like a perfect storm,   Groupon may end up being the biggest  train wreck in Tech history.   Analysts gave Groupon a hard time for passing on the Google deal but I think this criticism may have been premature.  Google is not stupid and I would venture a guess that acquisition terms and  the ability of Groupon investors and execs to cash out were predicated on performance targets that Groupon knew it couldn't meet.   The only choice it has now is to go public and raise capital to fund the business.   Unfortunately for Groupon,   it isn't too big to fail.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
274415,20991,2011-06-12T03:09:37-04:00,,"Mark and Joseph over at Observational Epidemiology  have come to the end (I think) of a fantastic series of posts about  Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) which get to the heart of the question I was trying to ask here: does Groupon actually work, in practice, in the way it’s meant to work, in theory?A lot of the recent analysis of Groupon has concentrated on the  financials, which have a habit of proving whatever you want them to  prove. Yes, Groupon is losing ever-increasing amounts of money — but  it’s doing so because it can, and because it’s convinced that  all the money it’s spending on customer acquisition today is going to be  repaid in spades tomorrow. If Groupon stopped spending money today on  customer acquisition and marketing, it would be extremely profitable  already, at its present size. It just wants to get even bigger and more  profitable still, as fast as possible: a perfectly respectable  capitalist goal.Which brings us to the question of whether size matters, when it  comes to Groupon. Insofar as Groupon has a moat — something which  protects it from competition — it’s scale. But is scale particularly  useful for Groupon? Where are the economies, there?The simple and obvious answer is that the more customers Groupon has,  the better it can get at targeting deals. Groupon is all about local —  but if you live in a big city, some restaurant over on the other side of  town ain’t local. If, thanks to its scale, Groupon can show you places  much closer to home, or otherwise targeted to what you’re interested in  buying, it will have a huge advantage over most of its competitors.And then there’s the “Group” part of “Groupon” — the social aspect of  the site, with people turning deals into opportunities to get together  with their friends in the real world. Again, as with any network, size is crucial.Mark started off the thread by pushing back against my assertion  — sourced to Groupon itself — that diners spending their Groupon at a  restaurant averaged a check 80% greater than the face value of the  Groupon. Looking at the offers in his area, he reckoned that diners both  could and would spend almost exactly the amount of the Groupon.Joseph then followed up with more anecdote, buttressed by provocative thinking:I’m generally unpersuaded by argument from anecdote, and I don’t  think the priming effect is all that strong. But the post was a great  one if only because it set off a whole stream of posts from Mark,  starting with the smart thesis that people buying Groupon shares are  basically buying a lottery ticket. It’s true that if  Groupon cracks the targeting nut, then it will be worth many billions  of dollars. But there’s no evidence that it knows how to do that, or  that it has yet done so, or that it’s going to be able to do so in  future.In a follow-up post,  Mark tried to work out how Groupon was targeting its offers, based on  the offers he was receiving. Except it was pretty clear, from an offer  he got for a 24-Karat-Gold Specialty Facial and Chocolate Foot Scrub  (only $125!) that there was really no targeting going on at all. Which  impression was buttressed by the fact that Groupon was advertising as  “New” its attempts to get its readers to hand over basic information  about themselves, such as their sex and zip code.And Mark’s smart when it comes to noticing  the strategy behind Groupon’s messaging, too: the company is signing up  subscribers by promising to save them money, rather than help them  discover new merchants. Maybe that’s the best way to get new subscribers  in the door — but it does hint at a quantity-over-quality mindset which  isn’t entirely alien to Groupon’s founders:If there’s a weakness here it’s that Mark is being way too scientific  about the fuzzy art of marketing when it comes to small local  merchants. Groupon can carve out an impressive business just by being  better than a billboard, if enough merchants come back for more. And so  far, Groupon’s merchants have shown themselves to be quite willing to be repeat customers. But will that last? I suspect Mark might be right about this:I do worry that Groupon is as famous for being valuable and  fast-growing as it is for providing the first-ever scalable solution to  the problem of how small local businesses can leverage the marketing  power of the internet. It feels like a momentum play, in contrast to say  Google, which is a stock I’d happily own on a multi-decade time  horizon.Mark concludes:I can definitely see Groupon recapitulating the arc of AOL. It will  build a solidly profitable core business, which will go into decline,  and then will have to work out whether and how to pivot to something  else.At the same time, I can also see Groupon — and especially its nascent  Groupon Now business, if it ever takes off — becoming part of life as  it’s lived on a daily business, a bit like local cable TV. As Mark says,  it’s a lottery ticket. And if you buy it on the first day of trading,  after it’s already had its first-day pop, then you’d better be feeling  lucky."
274352,22762,2011-06-10T14:10:47-04:00,,"By Sarah LacyI am in Chicago where I was supposed to be having dinner with Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) CEO Andrew Mason last night, a dinner planned more than a month ago  when I bought my plane ticket. Instead, he has suddenly decided to go to  China.It was bad news for me, but good news for anyone looking to buy  shares in the company. Also good news: TechCrunch has learned that  Groupon's sprawling, costly international operations have recently been  brought back under control of Groupon's more rigorous U.S. management  team.This all matters greatly for potential investors, because as the S1  showed, much of Groupon's war chest of venture capital has gone to its  aggressive international expansion. As we reported last week, Groupon's U.S operations lost only $10.4 million last year, whereas the international operations lost $170.6 million.Much of that has gone to China. Five days after Groupon's January  near-$1 billion venture round was raised, a job board advertising  Groupon positions in China boasted ""near endless"" resources  from that round to build out the office. Reading that ad and looking at  how Groupon has done in China, one could argue not all that money was,  shall we say, judiciously spent. A more blunt way of putting it would be Groupon's China team made drunken sailors look fiscally responsible.Despite Mason's blithe statements to the contrary on stage at All Things D, China is not going well  for Groupon. In fact, by all accounts, Groupon has made every classic  Silicon-Valley-Web-company-enters-China mistake in the book: Sparring  with its local partners,  putting foreigners who have little understanding of the local market in  charge, and focusing hiring on bankers and international MBAs, not  locals.One of two things was going through Mason's head when he said China  was going well: He was doing some hardcore spinning or has no idea just  how badly things are going. If it's the latter, I imagine Mason is  getting an eyeful and an earful right about now. If he isn't, he needs  to get out of the Groupon offices and ask some locals how they think  Groupon is doing. (I would have asked him about it after he got off  stage, but he also cancelled that interview at the last minute.)Up until now, Groupon's international operations were run out of Germany by those famously wealthy German Internet tribute artists the Samwer Brothers.  Now that the Samwers have transitioned out of the company, TechCrunch  has learned that organizational structure is changing radically. All  international operations have been brought back under the U.S.  headquarters, reporting to new COO Margo Georgiadis, and judging from  his sudden travel plans, Mason is getting more involved too.I discovered this on my recent trip to Berlin, where I was supposed  to meet with someone to talk about the company's sprawling international  operations – also a long planned meeting. This one wasn't cancelled, but  I was told just before that the person I was meeting with could only  speak about the German market, and that all questions about the broader  international strategy had to go through the U.S. Nevermind that all my  previous inquiries about Groupon's international operations had all been  referred to Germany. It seemed no one was able to comment on the  leviathan sucking up hundreds of millions of dollars in investor cash.After much back and forth, I was finally told that the confusion  stemmed from the very recent change in who all the international  divisions reported to. Now, it's Georgiadis. When I asked to speak to  Georgiadis about the change, I was told the move was so recent she  hadn't even yet had the chance to check in with all of the country  heads. (We hear she's traveling in Europe now, presumably doing just  that.) Then, I was told Mason could speak about it at our dinner…which  got subsequently cancelled. And all of that was before the quiet period.  Now no one is telling me anything about anything.No one has gone so far to say on the record that the company was  unhappy with the job the Samwers did running international operations,  rather the official line is that it was a long-planned transition to be  implemented when the Samwers left the company. But the impression I've  gotten from talking to people inside and close to the company is that  this is most definitely a good thing.Indeed, the Samwers have had a mixed record with Groupon's  international operations. Some countries have gone well, some have had  early hiccups but are doing better now, and some don't seem to be going  well at all. In many markets Groupon is a solid number two player at  best. In Brazil, for instance, Peixe Urbano does better than Groupon; in several of European markets a consortium owned by angel investor Klaus Hommels beats Groupon, and in China a company called Lashao just dominates.One of Lashao's investors, GSR Ventures told me several weeks ago he  estimates Groupon does just one-tenth of Lashao's volume in China. ""The  nature of the business is it's quite easy to tell how things are going,""  GSR's Richard Lim says. ""You just have someone go look at the site and  see how many deals they have and how much they are discounting each  deal."" Groupon tried to buy Lashao for hundreds of millions of dollars  months ago, only to be rebuffed. It has since raised more  than $100 million at a $1 billion pre-money valuation, GSR says. Like  Groupon, it's growing insanely fast, eyeing its own high dollar IPO in  the future.No matter what Groupon's management changes say about how things have  gone in the past, the fact that Groupon's management team is taking a  more central role in running what's been a runaway cash-spending train  is no doubt good news for potential investors. It's hard to imagine  there won't be some changes and new discipline instiled. Maybe Groupon  will pull back; maybe it'll get more aggressive. But I'm betting from  now on Mason will have a better idea what's actually going on in one of  the biggest markets in the world.I can only hope for a future where someone at the company is able to  answer basic questions about the company's biggest cost center. After  all, investors probably won't be quite as forgiving as the press.Original Post"

They say that no expatriate executives have been fired or  left Groupon China recently.This seems to be a belated response to the very obvious problems at  Groupon China that seasoned observers have been noting since the group  buy website first opened up shop in Beijing and Shanghai:Groupon China was started and has been managed by a bunch of  trendy-looking but ineffectual foreigners who can’t speak Chinese and  are completely clueless about China.Firing four unnamed foreigners is not evidence that anything has changed.Meanwhile, Bloomberg has this report (which I’d wager a PR company helped put together) talking up Groupon’s Chinese partner Tencent:A few problems:1. Tencent will end up shafting Groupon If the Groupon model works in China, Tencent has nothing to gain by  partnering with Groupon. Tencent has its own Groupon style offerings,  and there is no need to make Groupon work for them to profit by the  model.2. Apple and “lifestyle”: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha This is too rich:So, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going to sell discounted iPads in China?Yeah right, why would Apple do this when there are already Chinese people willing to sell their kidneys to get an iPad, or get into fistfights at the Apple store just to get hold of one.Apple and Groupon China? Simply ridiculous. Even more ridiculous is the “city guide / lifestyle” nonsense.I first worked on city guide / lifestyle print magazines in the late 1990s in China:There is a small amount of money to be made in city guides and  lifestyle guide products in big Chinese cities. There is quite a bit  more money to be made in Internet and media products that help position  brands as desirable for the new rich and emerging middle classes (e.g. Cosmopolitan China magazine and Vogue China , possibly the P1 social network and the Financial Times‘ FT Rui magazine).There is also money to be made and a huge user demand for Dianping, which is like the Yelp of China that offers real, honest user reviews of restaurants.But, based on my personal experience since 1997, every foreign-funded  company I have ever encountered in China talking about making money  from local vendors based on a “lifestyle” proposition has about a year  or so before bankrupting itself or being run out of town.3. iResearchA final note: I don’t know if Groupon is paying iResearch, but  iResearch has a reputation in China for doing “research” for companies  who pay them. Somehow, the companies always end up looking very good in  their research reports.It’s all pre-IPO spin. Groupon China is simply a way to bleed cash.Original post"
274265,24394,2011-06-10T08:20:26-04:00,,"On Monday, I cut through the hype to reveal why I’m convinced that discount coupon juggernaut, Groupon, is going to face an uphill battle once it goes public.But I wasn’t as critical as one analyst, who pegged the company as  Wall Street’s latest ponzi-scheme. However, I did call into question  Groupon’s ability to stave off an ever-expanding field of competitors.One of those competitors happens to be internet behemoth, Google (Nasdaq: GOOG). In fact, Groupon rebuffed a $6 billion takeover offer from Google in December 2010.Based on recent developments, though, Groupon would be well-served to  adopt a more accommodating and less cavalier stance. I’ll let my  colleague, Justin Fritz, explain why… From Foe to Friend?As Justin revealed, whether Groupon’s CEO is ready to admit it yet or not, the competition is heating up in a major way.Once Google’s payment service begins to gain traction with consumers,  we’re convinced that integration of Groupon (and Groupon Now) within  the Google Wallet app won’t be far behind. That way, consumers can use  both Google Offers coupons and Groupon vouchers in the same place.Then again, while combining Google’s superior payment platform with  Groupon’s burgeoning customer base appears like a win-win, there’s no  guarantee it’s going to happen. After all, big egos have obstructed  sound business decisions plenty of times before.And if Groupon chooses to shun Google again, it will be one more reason why I think investors should shun Groupon’s IPO."

In an earlier article, we noticed the average revenue per Groupon sold and the number of Groupons purchased per customer both declined.There's a good reason those two metrics are declining, and that reason is simple -- competition.  All the competitors listed below have very similar appoaches to Groupon.  In some cases the user interface is indistinguishable because the Groupon interface has been copied over and over.There's no brand loyalty in the business.  It's strictly a deal-by-deal business by definition.

First it seems Groupon's management couldn't care less about shareholders and profit. Second, it's a good thing Groupon's management doesn't care about making money because it looks like they might have a tough time doing that.The introductory letter from Andrew Mason in the S-1 filing tells you all you need to know about management. Basically Groupon would like you to value them based on the income they earn before a bunch of (expensive) costs they incur to earn said income. Of course it's not really a surprise when you look at the financial statements.  Marketing and acquisition costs per subscriber and per Groupon are climbing. Even if you back out the cost of acquisitions and just use the marketing cost line item the cost per subscriber has doubled. Given all the competitors popping up lately this shouldn't be a surprise. Also alarming is the fact that revenue per subscriber and revenue per Groupon is going down. It is even more pronounced in Groupon's two oldest markets. First up is Chicago.(Click to enlarge) Revenue per subscriber has dropped from $43.37 to $14.29 and the average revenue per  Groupon” is down more than $10 dollars. Next is Boston.(Click to enlarge) Boston has seen an even more pronounced drop in revenue per subscriber, from $41.01 to $11.94. Revenue per Groupon” also has been dropping the last four quarters. Management that doesn't care about shareholders and made up Non-GAAP financial measures to mask declining business fundamentals, I guess its (1999 Tech Bubble) déjà vu all over again.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
273680,24112,2011-06-07T09:06:44-04:00,,"On June 2, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) filed for an initial public offering that could potentially raise $750m. This enormous valuation is justified through its huge increases in revenue, user base and number of Groupons sold. However, on closer inspection it may seem that Groupon is playing a little smoke and mirrors. A toxic mix of net losses, increasing expenses, growing competition and loss in merchants should make potential investors think twice.Investors shouldn’t expect profits anytime soon, since Groupon has failed to deliver a net profit in its first three years of operations. Groupon recorded a $389m loss in 2010 and $102m in the first quarter of this year. This trend will continue as Groupon has reported that expenses “will increase substantially in the foreseeable future.”Additionally, the competition in the deal-sharing marketplace is just getting started. Given the low barriers to entry, Groupon will face considerable competition from various start-ups, and from Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG),  who have been actively trying to enter the space.Most importantly, the number of merchants that have used Groupon’s services is declining as many fail to see repeat customers. While Groupon may be satisfying the paying public, businesses are disillusioned by the model and will eventually abandon Groupon.Groupon’s IPO harkens back to the 1990s tech bubble through its focus on growth and free cash flow while sidelining the issues of profitability, growing competition and sustainability. Buyers beware.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

For example, at last count Linkedin (LNKD) had 102 million subscribers and 75 million hit the site on a monthly basis for the March 2011 quarter.  Renren (NYSE:RENN) produced similar data.Only 19% of GRPN's subscribers were customers as of the March 2011 quarter. S-1 page 41 THE GOODFor the March quarter GRPN spent $180 million for subscriber acquisition and acquired 32.5 million new subscribers.  Customers increased by 6.8 million.The acquisition cost per customer for the March quarter is $26.47 ($180 million / 6.8 million), although some customers may have been prior subscribers.   The gross profit per customer in the March quarter was $17.08.If those numbers remain static (and they won't remain static based on competition and other factors), the time to breakeven (on a gross profit basis) for acquiring new customers is less than five months.THE BADGRPN's CEO is young,  inexperienced, somewhat arrogant and apparently believes his own press releases.  That kind of kind of leadership behavior is dangerous and risky for an emerging company and is a setup for being blindsided.Current and potential competitors include public companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Open Table (NASDAQ:OPEN), Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), The Knot (KNOT); as well as many private companies including Living Social, Yelp, CouponMom, Thrillist, Lifebooker, BuyWithMe, Bloomspot, WagJag, DealFind,  DealCatcher, Daily Ticket, etc. etc. etc.Overall, GRPN's average revenue per customer for the March 2011 quarter is down 10% to $40.80 from $45.11 compared to the December 2009 quarter. Groupons sold per customer dropped 13% to 1.78 from 2.04.Regarding specific markets, we analyzed data provided in GRPN's S-1 filing for the Chicago, Boston, Berlin and London markets. S-1 page 74  Chicago and Boston were the first two markets established by Groupon. The rate of growth headed south for almost all metrics.  In particular, average revenue per customer dropped and Groupons sold per customer also dropped.Also, it's very doubtful that Groupon can maintain the very high current international price points, based on comparing London and Berlin market data with Chicago and Boston data.For the March 2011 quarter average revenue per customer varied from $34.12 in Boston to $138.68 in London followed by $87.88 per customer in Berlin.  Chicago's average revenue per customer was on the low side at $38.90.  We expect to see much further deterioration in revenue per customer in London and Berlin, at the very least.Groupons sold per customer for the March 2011 quarter were:  Chicago, 1.7; Boston, 1.4; Berlin, 3.3; London, 2.8.  With more competition in the international markets, Groupons sold per customer can be expected to decline, perhaps to the levels of more mature markets such as Chicago and Boston.Yes, GRPN was an initial novelty and first mover and captured the low hanging fruit.  Now, however, there is lots of current and potential competition.  According to the laww of supply and demand, GRPN's price points (average revenue per customer) are destined to continue to fall, particularly in markets that appear overpriced, such as London and Berlin.CHICAGONot good news.

273753,24394,2011-06-07T15:00:42-04:00,,"Finally, after weeks of non-stop speculation and anticipation, discount coupon juggernaut, Groupon has submitted its plan for an initial public offering. Last Thursday, the company filed to raise at least $750 million and trade under the ticker symbol GRPN.Given the smashing success of LinkedIn’s (LNKD)  recent stock market debut (shares more than doubled in the first day of  trading), I fully expect to see overwhelmingly bullish predictions  about Groupon’s IPO. My feeling? Non-plussed. In fact, I refuse to be part of the hype.The reason is simple: After reviewing Groupon’s preliminary prospectus, there’s definitely cause for concern. I know -- who invited Captain Buzzkill to the IPO party? But hear me  out on this one and I’m sure you’ll agree. Or at the very least, you’ll  know to proceed with caution, instead of buying blindly on IPO hype.You Can’t Deny the Growth,  But It Won’t LastI’ll give Groupon credit for one thing: It exploited a classic  first-mover advantage to the highest order. And in the process, the  company has unlocked staggering growth. Since cranking up the deal machine in 2008, the company has managed to increase:And although the company has yet to turn a profit, that’s still eye-popping growth that other companies would love to have. But the fuzzy feeling ends there. Such growth just can’t continue at that pace. It’s simply  not possible given a limited market opportunity. And that’s particularly  true in this case, considering all the competition that’s knocking on  the door…The Competition Heats UpIn Groupon’s IPO prospectus,  the company readily admits, “Our business is highly competitive.  Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.”Even more damning, it confesses that “no significant barriers to entry exist” for competitors.Groupon doesn’t offer anything truly unique. Heck, it  doesn’t even offer a product. It simply partners with merchants to offer  discounts to consumers and, in return, it gets a cut of the action. But anyone with an Internet connection, an email list and a willing merchant can offer the same thing.And when Groupon touts its competitive advantages, it ironically  underscores this glaring weakness in the process. It lists “customer  experience and relevance of deals,"" “merchant scale and quality,"" and  “brand” as its differentiating factors.Take a close look at that list again. None represent sustainable business advantages. There are no proprietary technology, or cutting-edge innovation, or  critical and exclusive relationships helping Groupon stand out from the  crowd.Sure, the company boasts one confirmed patent and five pending  patents. But none promise to box out the competition. At best, they’ll  allow Groupon to operate more efficiently. After all, you can’t patent  offering coupons online.Add it all up and it’s no surprise that the number of competitors is  exploding. In fact, just from my quick count this morning, Groupon’s  gone from being the only coupon kid on the Internet in 2008 to one of  about 300 today. Current competitors – both domestic and international – now include  Living Social, GoogleOffers, BuyWithMe, Ideeli, AmazonLocal (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY),  DealCatcher, and Daily Ticket. The list goes on and on.Let the Price Wars BeginWith so much competition, it’s only a matter of time before “price  wars” begin. By that, I mean Groupon’s rivals are bound to begin  offering better terms to merchants in order to steal market share. This  is just simple business strategy. (For example, Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) just priced its  Thrive tablet PC, due for release on July 10, below Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad 2.)Remember, the way these online deal companies make money is by  retaining a piece of the deals they sell. And if you’re a merchant, you  want to keep the most money possible.So let’s say a Groupon competitor offers to give a merchant 70% of  the revenue generated, versus the 50% revenue-sharing agreement that  Groupon reportedly offers. Who do you think the merchant will do  business with? It’s a no-brainer.Yes, other considerations – list size and average revenue generated  per deal – are bound to factor into a merchant’s decision. But over  time, as competitors grow in size, those considerations become less  significant. And in the end, Groupon won’t be able to resist the price  war.Essentially, the online coupon market is destined to become a  commodity market. And as Groupon reveals, increased competition could  “reduce our market share and adversely impact our gross margin.” In other words, the company’s gross margins are likely to decrease, not increase, from here on. And that promises to put significant pressure on profitability.Hardly an attractive business model. And the bloated numbers are concerning, too.Pie-in-the-Sky Numbers and Negative Insider MovesNot long ago, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  reportedly tried to buy Groupon for about $5.3 billion. Fast forward a  mere six months and now Groupon could be worth up to $30 billion. Sound the alarm bell.Google wasn’t even worth that much when it went public back in August  2004. It debuted at a market value of $27 billion. And Groupon is  certainly no Google. Not to mention, no matter how quickly Groupon is growing, nothing  justifies an almost five-fold increase in market value in that short  period of time.Equally concerning is the action of Groupon insiders. The IPO filing  reveals that it's been cashing out via dividends on preferred stock  and redemption of preferred stock for years, to the tune of $60 million. It’s not clear how much stock insiders will be selling via the IPO,  as it’s not listed in the preliminary prospectus. But that’s definitely  a number you want to monitor as Groupon races to go public and files  updated IPO terms.If insiders end up selling a sizeable stake in the IPO, that’s hardly a bullish sign for individual investors.Don’t Believe the HypeBottom line: I’m not saying Groupon’s IPO is destined to fail. Hype  is a powerful market force and the stock could very well jump out of the  gate, just like LinkedIn did. But remember, IPO hype fades quickly, as  it did for LinkedIn.If you bought shares of that “must-have” IPO on its first day of  trading, you’re nursing losses of about 36% right now. So if you’re  thinking about buying Groupon shares on their first day, think twice, as  the move could prove similarly disappointing.That said, if you can get shares from your broker at the initial IPO  price, take them. You’re unlikely to get more than 100 shares, of course.  But there’s no reason to turn down an easy profit. Just don’t hang on to  shares, as Groupon doesn’t boast a business model that makes for an  attractive long-term investment. And I’m even more convinced of that,  based on the company’s current valuation and the actions of insiders."
273334,23395,2011-06-05T02:56:04-04:00,,"Groupon filed Thursday with the SEC to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering. The Chicago, IL-based company is a local e-commerce site that serves as an intermediary between merchants and customers, allowing merchants to broadcast sales and discounts (groupons) to local Groupon members.According to the SEC filing, Groupon operates in 175 different markets in the US and 43 different countries, allowing over 56 thousand merchants to advertise sales to over 83 million subscribers using daily email, website postings, mobile applications, and social networks. Reaching beyond its American roots, the company derived only 46% of its revenue from its North American segment in the most recent quarters. In the three months ended March 31, the company's broad subscriber base purchased over 28 million groupons.Groupon generates its revenue when customers purchase their coupon offerings, with gross profit being the amount of the ticket price retained after paying a percentage to the offering merchants. The company has grown revenue by leaps and bounds since it was founded in November 2008, and generated $645 million in revenue for the March quarter, up a whopping 63% from the fourth quarter 2010. Although it is not yet profitable, Groupon's free cash flow is positive ($72 million in 2010 on $713 million in revenue) due to the lag in paying merchants their share of customers' up-front payments. The company plans on using the proceeds from the offering to bolster working capital and for general corporate purposes.Groupon's filing is a further indicator of the recent strength and continued interest in internet companies. Year to date there have been 69 IPOs launched, of which 28 are venture capital-backed. These 28 venture-backed deals have averaged a 23% return versus an average 6% return from the rest. These results, the high profile launches of companies like LinkedIn (LNKD), and a proliferation of funds seeking returns from the growth of social media have given impetus to a further round of offerings with notable tech companies like Zynga and Pandora Radio (NYSE:P) joining Groupon in seeking public offerings. Pandora set terms for its IPO Friday and is looking to raise $109 million  when the deal prices the week of June 13.Groupon plans to list under the symbol (NASDAQ:GRPN). Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are the lead underwriters on the deal. No pricing terms were disclosed."

Today it finally opened its books in its preliminary filing to go public.Wow.[Click to enlarge]In the first quarter of 2009, the online deal company mustered only a quarter of million in revenue. In the first quarter of 2011, it brought in almost $650 million.Wow.Only slightly less wow, by the way, is the fact that Groupon lost $103 million in the first quarter. Marketing and SG&A are expensive."
273318,21016,2011-06-03T22:39:24-04:00,,"Whatever you think about Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) itself, or the potential bubble in web 2.0 companies, the story of this company is staggering.  This entity was not even in existence until late  2008; within two years it rejected an offer by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for a buyout at  $5-6 Billion.  [Nov 30, 2010:  From Startup in 2008 to Potential $5-$6B Buyout from Google in 2010.]     And now roughly half a year after that rejection, it is filing IPO  papers that will potentially give it a valuation of some $30 Billion.   And that is before the retail crowd jumps in on day one, pumping the stock to who knows what valuation.  Again, this company was not around three years ago.   The expectation was for a late 2011 IPO, but I think the company is smart  to go earlier, as the fervor in the space is at fever pitch and no one  knows what the market will be like in six or 12  months.  As the  company is in its early, hyper-growth stage, investors currently  are willing to pay almost any price, despite lack of profits.  As with  most of these type of companies, the idea is build it and the profits  will come.   Zynga also is striking while the fire is hot.  Obviously the giant on the hill, Facebook, is the ultimate deal; seemingly it's still going to wait until 2012.   Via NYT Dealbook:Here is where the ""bubble"" talk resurfaces. Since Groupon is not  profitable under conventional means ... well, it makes up its own  standard -- similar to what we saw in 1999.  Although, to be fair, Groupon  has far more revenue than 99% of the things that were coming out in  1998-99.Original post"
273204,20051,2011-06-03T10:42:08-04:00,,"The IPO market is beginning to catch fire with the tech  industry partying like it’s 1999.  The party lights glowed and the DJ  began spinning the beats before the LinkedIn (LNKD) IPO a couple weeks  ago and the party will continue reaching a feverish pitch with a Groupon IPO.  I mentioned in my blog post about the LinkedIn IPO  that others would soon follow (particularly Groupon, Facebook and  possibly Twitter) on the heels of the massive success of LinkedIn.  Groupon announced that it has filed  for an IPO and hopes to raise $750 million.  If the LinkedIn deal is  any indication, the Chicago-based daily deal company could raise well  north of $1 billion in an IPO.These recent high profile SEC filings, which would include  Pandora’s announcement that its IPO is imminent, further increases the  chatter about a tech bubble about to burst, which could also potentially  signal the top of this meteoric market rise off the March 2009 bottom.   Why?  Following the market crash in 2000 and 2008, the IPO market was  reduced to only those companies that were for the most part showing  decent profits.  As the IPO market catches fire again, you have Internet  companies that are far from profitable trying to cash in as investors  and traders themselves try to cash in on the “next big thing.”  There’s  no doubt Groupon is a hot commodity and its growth is staggering.  We’re  talking about a company that did $30 million in revenues in 2009, then  hit over $700 million last year.  There is one problem though.  This is a  company also burning through a staggering amount of cash, to the tune of  over $400 million last year.  The red ink floodgates are still open  this year as the company lost over $100 million in the first quarter.   Pandora is also still swimming in red ink after 10 years in business.Despite the heavy losses I think we can expect another impressive  opening for Groupon and to a lesser degree Pandora.  The party can  continue longer than we think and may not reach a peak until the  Facebook IPO comes to fruition.  As I mentioned with the LinkedIn IPO  post, it’s best to let these high-flier IPOs (or any IPO for that  matter) trade for a few weeks to see where the base develops.  LinkedIn is well off the opening high and continues to try to find the  bottom of a base.  Should LinkedIn form a shallow base and break out to  new highs quickly, it could signal this hot IPO market is here to stay  for a while."
273327,20991,2011-06-05T02:12:55-04:00,,"David Sinsky has some extremely smart Groupon analysis over at the Yipit blog, using numbers from the company’s S-1 to throw into question just how good Groupon is at making ever-increasing amounts of money once it has entered a market.That is, after all, the explicit rationale behind Groupon’s ever-increasing losses:Groupon breaks out granular details for four cities in its S-1 — Chicago, its home; Boston, its second-oldest US market; Berlin; and London. The first is unique in many ways, while the last two were acquired when Groupon bought CityDeal, so Sinsky concentrates on Boston. And finds this: These charts show quarterly revenue per subscriber, on the left — that’s people getting Groupon’s emails — and per customer, on the right, which is people who have actually bought coupons. Both are going down, which is worrisome.The reason to worry about these trends is that as many people including Joshua Gans have said, the daily-deal space has very low barriers to entry and is highly competitive. As such, if Groupon has a “moat” — a comparative advantage over its competitors which is very difficult to overcome — it’s its sheer size.Size confers many advantages, not least targeting. As Kaiser Fung notes, the more new customers and fewer existing customers that a Groupon reaches, the more profitable it’s likely to be for the merchant concerned. The best Groupons target a whole new audience for the merchant in question: the S-1 gives the example of a cruise line which was doing very well with its murder-mystery cruises but much less well with its romantic-dinner cruises. By offering a Groupon valid only for the romantic-dinner cruises, the company managed to broaden its customer base without losing revenues from its existing customers.Benjamin Edelman says that for a Groupon to be highly profitable, it should be targeted at people who are “particularly unfamiliar with a participating merchant’s services.” And it stands to reason that Groupon, with the largest subscriber base and the most sophisticated targeting technology, should be better able to target Groupons at relatively narrow classes of people than any of its subscribers.At the same time, because the best Groupons are aimed at people who are likely to become regular customers of the merchant in question and who are well-disposed towards trying it out, sophisticated targeting should increase Groupon’s conversion rate substantially. Rather than just send the same deal out to everybody in a city, Groupon should be able to show you only those offers you’re most likely to want, and thereby increase its conversion rate.Sinsky says that doesn’t seem to have happened in practice: “As the average purchases per customer continues to decline,” he writes, “so will overall conversion rates on personalized deals.” The trend isn’t good: Groupon’s Boston customers are less engaged, and less profitable — even as Groupon’s costs for acquiring new customers continue to rise.That said, Sinsky doesn’t think that what we’re seeing here is a failure of Groupon’s targeting per se. Instead, we’re seeing the effects of competition. Which is where Yipit’s own data comes in:Realistically, what we’re seeing is improvements in Groupon’s targeting technology failing to compensate for the rise in competition (which also increases Groupon’s customer-acquisition costs.) Anecdotally, targeting technology still has a long way to go: for one thing, Groupon still isn’t remotely local enough in cities where people spend most of their money within a mile or so of where they live, and where they often get offers for merchants on the other side of town. But it’s not even clear how Groupon is going to get the kind of highly granular data about its subscribers’ income, and profession, and exact location, and other things which would help it target offers. That’s where the likes of Facebook and Foursquare have a clear advantage.So while Groupon is still the biggest of the deal sites, the jury’s still out on the degree to which its size is going to prove an unassailable advantage over the long term. In principle, a massive subscriber base could be a huge competitive advantage. But in practice, this could be one area where Groupon finds it hard to execute."
273143,21382,2011-06-03T02:24:17-04:00,,"Groupon finally filed for its IPO Thursday and now we can see its finances laid bare (click for full financial table). Groupon has been growing at an astounding rate. Last year, its revenues grew more than 22,000 percent to $713 million. And in the first quarter of 2011 alone, it nearly matched all of its revenue from last year with $644 million in sales, up 13,575 percent from a year ago.If you annualize Groupon’s first-quarter numbers, you get a revenue run rate of $2.6 billion for 2011, and that is not even factoring in any growth in subsequent quarters. So the $3 billion to $4 billion estimates that were thrown out a while ago for 2011 revenue look very achievable.Groupon had 83.1 million subscribers as of March 31, 2011, up from 3.4 million the year before. In the first quarter of this year alone, it added 32.5 million subscribers and it sold 28 million Groupons across all 83.1 million subscribers.But what about profits? Groupon lost $456 million last year, and another $147 million last quarter. And don’t expect those losses to go away anytime soon. CEO Andrew Mason warns future public shareholders, “We aggressively invest in growth.” Groupon spends a lot of money “acquiring new subscribers.” About 54 percent of its operating expenses goes towards marketing. The other 46 percent goes towards sales.Half of its workforce of about 8,000 people are in sales, a number CEO Andrew Mason threw out during an interview at the D9 conference. As of March 31, 2011, however, according to the filing, there were 7,107 employees and 3,556 sales people. Of those sales people, the majority (2,895) are international. They represent 81 percent of the salesforce, but only 54 percent of Groupon’s total revenues in the first quarter. That is where Groupon is investing for growth—overseas. That is also where Groupon is losing most of its money. The U.S operations lost only $10.4 million last year, whereas the international operations lost $170.6 million.Groupon and its bankers will be pointing to its gross profits instead, which are much healthier. Gross profits were up about 24,600 percent last year to $280 million, from $10.9 million the year before. And gross profits in the first quarter of 2011 came in at $270 million, which nearly matched all of last year’s gross profits. Those were up from $20 million the year before.Investing for growth is fine, but ultimately a company (and its shares) are measured by how much of those profits the company actually keeps.Original post"

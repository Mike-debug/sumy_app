Grubhub will consolidate with the European food delivery powerhouse to form 'the largest food delivery business outside China'. Many analysts are positive about this merger, they think that Jitse Groen, CEO of JET, can make Grubhub the market leader in the United States again. But in this write-up, I will explain why this deal might not benefit existing Just Eat Takeaway shareholders, and instead, adds serious execution risks.In the beginning, Grubhub functioned as a marketplace. Customers would go to their website, find a restaurant, and order food. All Grubhub did was notify the restaurant, and take a hefty commission. A very profitable business, obviously. Just Eat Takeaway is a consolidation of many European food delivery services that created likewise marketplaces, so on a first glance, there is an obvious match.Around 2015 Grubhub was the clear market leader in the United States food delivery space, but other food delivery competitors started gaining market share with a new model, they actually started delivering food. In particular, DoorDash and Uber Eats started building a delivery platform meaning they were responsible for the deliveries, not the restaurants themselves. Obviously, a lot of restaurants like this, doing the deliveries is a time-intensive endeavour, with very little payoff. Restaurants prefer paying a higher fee while avoiding the hassle of delivering food themselves. Restaurant owners could spend their time doing what they do best, making good food.Ever since that moment, Grubhub has seen little growth compared to competitors. It was time for a change, so Grubhub decided to create their own delivery network. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh expects 45% of the 2020 revenue to be from Grubhub's own delivery network.(Source: Finance Yahoo)The other competitors are currently unprofitable, and because of this Grubhub is struggling to remain profitable as well. The EBITDA negative competitors are underpricing Grubhub. Jitse Groen is very critical of these competitors that 'are giving away free food' but at the same acknowledges that:And I think that sums up DoorDash's strategy. For them, the entirety of the United States is strategically important and they want to become the market leader there.As you can see profit margins of Grubhub have shrunk massively, and they actually had negative EBITDA growth last year, the exact thing Jitse Groen was ridiculing his competitors for during the call.Even the GrubHub CEO himself acknowledges that Grubhub's moat is weak. Customers feel little brand loyalty and order from multiple platforms. Obviously, this means that more expensive platforms price themselves out of the market.Big restaurant chains are holding all the power, and the food delivery platforms very little. A merger between two major food delivery platforms could have changed that, but unfortunately, that did not happen.In 2017 Grubhub had a 90%+ market share in New York City, so they are even losing relevance in their best performing areas. In the call, Grubhub management said New York City is actually the area with the most revenues relatively from the hybrid delivery/marketplace model.But the data is showing something else. If Grubhub wants to remain relevant it needs to fund growth by giving up profitability in some places, a difficult dilemma.Existing management has made the decision to build a delivery platform to follow the trend, it does not improve profitability but it makes sure your platform remains relevant. This, combined with the EBITDA negative competitors, is putting pressure on Grubhub's profitability.Jitse Groen, CEO of Just Eat Takeaway, is a firm believer in being a marketplace first, and a delivery platform on the side. Just last year Takeaway merged with Just Eat, where a similar discussion arose. Prosus(OTCPK:PROSY), a South African fund, trying to buy Just Eat wrote this about that:The reality is that Just Eat Takeaway does not have the capital to seriously transform Just Eat's business into a hybrid model, and they don't want to. Just Eat is the market leader in the United Kingdom but is experiencing pressure from Uber Eats and Deliveroo, who are building advanced delivery platforms. It seems like a matter of time until Just Eat undergoes the same fate as Grubhub, failing to follow the trend from strictly marketplaces to hybrid marketplaces with advanced delivery networks.Jitse Groen is a firm believer of the winner takes it all mentality. He believes market leaders will eventually come out victorious, but as I explained Grubhub is anything but a market leader currently. So he is gambling that he can make Grubhub the market leader again, but I don't see how he can turn around Grubhub and become the market leader in the United States without investing vast quantities of money.The Grubhub opportunity is in a sizeable, overdeveloped, overinvested country with attractive long-term growth potential but with a firmly established market leader, DoorDash(DOORD). In my opinion, the Grubhub merger goes against Jitse Groen's principles and is a risky bet that can easily dilute JET shareholder value.Just think about what that means. Uber Eats(UBER), a massive player in the US food delivery market, offered a lower price than Just Eat for Grubhub. Jitse Groen was ridiculing the competitors about their EBITDA negative growth, during the call about the merger, but he actually offered more than Uber, 'who are giving away free food'. Uber Eats would have profited massively from merging with Grubhub, the scale benefits would have been gigantic. This consolidated company had the firepower to outgrow DoorDash.But turns out that JET management was willing to offer a better deal than Uber Eats. Does that mean Uber management undervalued Grubhub or that JET management overvalued Grubhub? One thing is clear Uber management knows much more about the American market.JET management is moving fast, and until now they won everywhere where they tipped their toes, but even winners can start losing. Multiple analysts asked Jitse Groen in the call about the merger: 'why now?'. And he agreed that it is bad timing, but 'you can't expect Matt, CEO of Grubhub, to wait two years'. So in short, even the CEO agrees that he is rushing into this gigantic market.JET is merging with Grubhub and by doing so inherited a high debt load, while JET themselves has placed convertible bonds with a much lower coupon rate.The market's reaction on the proposed merger between Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway was double-sided. For Grubhub shareholders it was a win, they will own the leader of the European food delivery space, but for JET shareholders it was a loss. The market was clear: this merger is diluting JET shareholder value.Antitrust risks are practically nonexistent since both companies operate on different continents. Obviously it's not exactly zero but I would be very surprised if there were any problems of that sort.Shareholders obviously have to approve the merger and that does add some uncertainty. Grubhub shareholders will very likely approve the merger but Just Eat Takeaway shareholders may be a bit more hesitant. The market reaction itself shows that the JET shareholders are a bit concerned.Just Eat Takeaway management stepped into the most competitive food delivery market in the world. Clearly there is much to win, but there is also much to lose. One thing is clear, with this merger Just Eat Takeaway has lengthened its path to profitability, and the market knows it.I'm planning to write another article discussing Just Eat Takeaway's European food delivery platforms in depth. Remember to follow me on Seeking Alpha if you are interested."
4354577,101571,2020-06-18T17:32:54-04:00,"Grubhub's upcoming merger with Just Eat Takeaway.com happens with both companies experiencing accelerated growth in their platforms.Scale matters and profitability could be just a hop, skip, and jump away for the combined company.Grubhub's upside looks capped at these levels meaning investors should find other opportunities until 2021.","Just Eats Takeaway.com N.V. (OTCPK:TKAYF) (JET for short) made some headlines leapfrogging Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER) to capture Grubhub Inc. (GRUB). Consolidation is rampant in the space as the latest merger deal should create additional scale and opportunity for the future largest online food delivery company outside of China. The combined company should continue to grow during the Covid-19 pandemic, while a return to profitability could spur the newly created American Depositary Receipts (ADR's) to new highs in 2021.The JET and Grubhub merger will give current Grubhub shareholders ADR's representing 0.6710 ordinary shares of JET for each share of Grubhub that they own at the close of the deal. Trading shares on the Over-The-Counter OTC market as a European company might be a new experience for many retail investors. However, international exposure should be a part of most investor portfolios as global markets look to rebound from coronavirus.Investors should not be overly concerned with the viability of the new Grubhub/JET company as both companies are showing the ability to prosper during coronavirus. Take a look at how their growth rates are faring compared to earlier in 2020.Table by Trent WelshThese growth rates show that the surge in orders is currently not just a U.S. based cyclical phenomenon, but possibly, a global secular growth phenomenon that is still in its early stages. Coronavirus is reshaping workplace and stay-at-home productivity leading to potential long-term food delivery benefits. Large workplace cafeterias might become obsolete while employees pursue greater productivity from home by ordering meals instead of making them. Restaurants could also embrace social distancing for the rest of 2020, making delivery options more prevalent as restaurants continue to sit only half or a third of their former customers at a time. Combine impressive order growth, an end of coronavirus delivery freebies, and cost cutting from increased scale, and the new Grubhub/JET company has a blueprint to quickly become profitable once the new company is formed in early 2021. The Grubhub/JET merger details go so far as to say that the new company will be one of the few profitable players at scale in the space. A return to profitability might happen sooner than later as Grubhub was healthily profitable back in 2018.Grubhub built up a lot of goodwill with their public relations by supporting industry during the outbreak of coronavirus. Grubhub took a $100M hit the past couple of months by deferring commissions, expanding substantial diner promotions, initiating contactless delivery, along with other investments in the company’s driver network to maintain a high level of service and safety. Initial expanding growth rates point to a potentially great investment by Grubhub at that time. However, the next couple of quarterly results will go a long way to show if Grubhub can maintain that higher growth rate, or if it will slowly drop back down towards the low double digits.Cost cutting in 2021 will be what really sets up the combined Grubhub/JET company for investor success. The original Uber and Grubhub proposed deal looked to have ~$300M in cost savings in conjunction with thousands of job cuts. The Grubhub/JET deal should have less job cuts as the scale the deal brings should be much more efficient. This is because JET had no virtually no U.S. exposure before the deal. It does have the clear delivery leader in Canada though, with its SkipTheDishes brand, whereas a Grubhub/Uber deal would have had lots of U.S. overlap ripe for job and cost cutting. The combined Grubhub/JET company will be built around four of the worlds largest profit pools outside of China in food delivery with an expanded U.S. and Canada North American branch, the U.K., the Netherlands, and finally Germany.All of these positives make Grubhub a great potential investment starting in 2021. However, for the rest of 2020, the upside potential of the company looks to be already built into the stock, especially after its latest run with the rest of the market.Means the merger is an all stock deal, shares of Grubhub and JET are free to move up and down freely due to market volatility. However, many investors will have that $75 initial June 9, 2020 offer price in their minds as a psychological cap. This cap is only about 15% higher than where Grubhub stands even though JET's stock has yet to recover from the initial drop that it saw when a potential deal leaked out into the market.The drop in JET's stock price, along with a needed built in deal discount (for the time investors have to wait until the deal closes in early 2021) means that I see little upside to Grubhub shares over the back half of 2020. This is especially true as another player like Uber reentering the fray seems unlikely due primarily to antitrust concerns along with the merger's mutual $144M termination fee.I see the Grubhub and JET merger as a great opportunity for investors in 2021 and beyond. Unfortunately, I see little additional upside for shareholders over the rest of 2020. This means that I am taking most of my nice short-term profits from the deal out for other opportunities in the back half of 2020. The scale, cost cutting, and accelerated growth of the combined platform could be impressive in 2021, but shareholders now might be at a very similar price point as investors jumping in at the end of 2020 or the beginning of next year. I have sold almost all of my formerly second largest individual stock position in Grubhub stock with the plan to potentially purchase additional shares around the beginning of 2021. Best of luck."
4353243,69675,2020-06-11T05:15:27-04:00,"The management teams at Grubhub and JET announced plans to merge, creating a behemoth in the food delivery market.This move is value-accretive for shareholders in Grubhub, and it's clear they are the primary beneficiaries of this arrangement.But it would be a mistake to say that JET isn't set to benefit nicely in the long run.This merger is wise from a long-term perspective.","There are multiple ways to expand a business. The most common way is through organic growth, which involves competing with incumbent players in your space that might be situated in the new market you’re interested in. Another, more peaceful, way can be through mergers and acquisitions. This second method is what was agreed to by shareholders of Just Eat Takeaway.com (OTCPK:TKAYF) and Grubhub (GRUB). The food delivery market is still fairly small, even in the countries that utilize it the most, but the growth prospects make it fertile ground for M&A activity. Instead of trying to kill one another, JET and Grubhub decided the best way is to work together. For shareholders in the former, the upside to this merger is in the ability to rapidly enter a new and massive market. For the shareholders in the latter, the upside is a nice payday and immediate international expansion. Clearly, Grubhub appears to be the winner from this marriage, but it would be a mistake to say that both players aren’t walking away stronger from this transaction.After a potential acquisition by Uber Technologies (UBER) fell through wherein that company could have bought up Grubhub, the latter struck a deal to be merged in with foreign rival JET. According to the terms of the arrangement, shareholders in Grubhub are set to receive 0.6710 ADR’s (American Depositary Receipts) in JET for every one share of Grubhub that they currently own. Using JET’s share price from June 9th, this works out to a price per share for Grubhub’s investors of $75.15. That implies upside of 27.3% compared to the $59.05 that shares of Grubhub closed at on June 10th.Following completion of the transaction, which management believes should close sometime in or at the end of the first quarter next year, Grubhub’s investors will own 30% of the combined entity. In all, the deal, from the June 9th value for JET used, works out to an equity value for Grubhub of $7.3 billion. Grubhub will, at least for now (and probably forever), continue to operate on its own, but JET alluded to operations it has in Canada and elsewhere that it believes could create some opportunities for the combined company to run more efficiently.At first glance, the purchase price for Grubhub looks absurd. And in a way, it is. $7.3 billion works out to some pretty high multiples. Last year, for instance, Grubhub generated operating cash flow of $182.6 million. This was actually down from the $225.5 million the firm saw a year earlier. This price/operating cash flow multiple comes out to about 40. EBITDA was at a similar level, totaling $186.2 million for the year, down from the prior year’s $233.7 million. Full net income for Grubhub in 2019 was -$18.6 million, but it’s important to not punish the firm too harshly for one-time blips. In the five years ending in 2019, aggregate profits for the firm totaled $246.5 million.One thing can be made very clear: Grubhub and JET are not prospective investments for value-oriented investors. They are all about growth as the trading multiples I stated show very clearly. For investors who believe in the growth prospects of this space and who don’t mind playing the very long game, there is definite rationale behind JET’s move. Consider, for instance, just how fast growth has been. Between 2015 and 2019, Grubhub’s number of active diners surged from only 6.75 million to 22.62 million. Between just 2018 and 2019 alone, the growth rate was 27.9%. The value of food ordered on the platform rose from $2.35 billion to $5.91 billion over the timeframe covered, allowing the company’s revenue to skyrocket 262.5% from $361.83 million to $1.31 billion. Another way to measure Grubhub’s success is to consider its daily average ‘Grubs’. This number back in 2015 came out to 227,100. By 2019, it had grown to 492,300.*Taken from GrubhubThis kind of growth is attractive, but what’s most important is that it continues. So far, the data is encouraging. In the first five months of this year, the company delivered 86 million meals. This is 11% higher than the same period last year and it’s in spite of a weak market in the US caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps even more impressive is the growth seen in April and May of this year. Total orders here totaled 39 million, about 28% higher than the 30 million seen in the same two months last year.*Taken from GrubhubAs impressive as Grubhub’s performance figures have been, JET’s have been even better. The company delivered 208 million orders in the first five months this year, up 23% from the 169 million seen in the same five months of 2019. In April and May, orders of 96 million trumped the 68 million orders seen in the same two months last year (implying a year-over-year growth rate of 41%). What these figures show is that the food delivery business is alive and well.*Taken from GrubhubIn addition to seeing robust growth recently, there’s also the fact that JET and Grubhub, despite being in the same industry, aren’t in the same markets. Grubhub is essentially a US-based operation. JET, on the other hand, is well-diversified across multiple key markets. The big ones are the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. It also has a rapidly-growing stake in Canada, where year-over-year growth so far in 2020 has been 51%. About 29.8% of the firm’s 208 million orders this year came from the UK, followed by 19.2% for Germany. Its Rest of World segment, meanwhile, accounted for 27.9% of orders for the year so far. This shows the firm has itself well-established into other, smaller markets.Together, Grubhub and JET will succeed in capturing four massive markets for food delivery. Grubhub has a larger physical footprint, with more than 300,000 restaurants connected to its platform as of the end of its 2019 fiscal year. This is nearly double the 155,000 connected restaurants that JET caters to. That said, the concentration of users is flipped entirely. As of last year, the nearly 23 million users on Grubhub’s platform were dwarfed by the 48 million on JET’s properties. JET’s 413 million orders resulted in a value of orders made worth $9.4 billion, which was 59.3% higher than Grubhub’s.Looking at the deal, it’s clear that Grubhub’s investors are walking away with a pretty sweet arrangement. The premium paid for Grubhub, as expressed by the trading multiple applied to last year’s results, is significant. This isn’t to say that JET is a loser in this transaction though. In exchange for paying a hefty fee for Grubhub, the company’s investors receive immediate entry into a massive market that might be impossible for the firm to get if it were to try and expand here on its own. In the very long run, this deal will end up being accretive for JET’s investors too, but patience will be key in investors recognizing it."

(GRUB). The boards of both companies reached an agreement and will propose a merger to their respective shareholders. Just Eat Takeaway.com beats Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) which has been interested in acquiring Grubhub as well in order to strengthen its competing Uber Eats service. If the transaction goes through, it would create the largest food delivery company outside China.Yet, I believe that Just Eat Takeaway.com is taking a great risk. First of all, the price it is willing to pay is very generous given Grubhub's slower growth and limited potential for synergies. Furthermore, Grubhub's profitability is declining due to its considerably less fortified market position. Below, I will explain my thesis in more detail.Takeaway.com delivery driver; source: Just Eat Takeaway.com NV media kitThe deal will be structured as an all-share transaction and is expected to close in Q1 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Grubhub's owners receive the equivalent of 0.6710 Just Eat Takeaway.com shares (TKAYF) per share in the form of ADRs (TKAYY). Based on the last closing price prior to the announcement (June 9th; €98.60), that implies a valuation of $7.3 billion (=$75.15 per share) for Grubhub, a premium of about 27 percent. Grubhub shareholders will eventually own 30 percent of the combined company. Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney will remain in charge of the combined company's North American business as a member of the management board, while two current Grubhub directors will serve as members of the Just Eat Takeaway.com supervisory board.Matt Maloney, designated head of the North American business; source: Grubhub Inc.The food delivery business is one of the most cut-throat of all. Only a clear market leader has a realistic shot at sustainable profitability. Everyone else is basically burning money.Just Eat Takeaway.com has leading positions in several markets, including the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. It would be wiser to concentrate on fortifying and defending this position. 2019 was the first year of positive adjusted EBITDA for Takeaway.com NV (ex-Just Eat plc). Just Eat is more profitable, expecting an underlying EBITDA in the range of GBP200 million (slightly above $250 million at current exchange rates) and presumably generating a positive net income (2018: GPB79.9 million; 2019 figures not released). I believe that those profits would be better spend on the defense of existing markets rather than for a risky attempt to conquer America.The US market is regionally fragmented and very competitive. Following the 2013 acquisition of Seamless, Grubhub has once before been in a market leading position. The emergence of new rivals such as Uber Eats, Postmates (POSTM) and DoorDash (DOORD) has since cost market share and strained margins. They may not have a clear path to sustainable profitability themselves but they can certainly hurt Grubhub. For 2019, the company reported a net loss of $27.7 million. That number climbed to $33.4 million in Q1 alone. The Q1 adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA decreased 59 percent YoY, thus accelerating the pace of decline from 37 percent YoY for the full year 2019. Given the fact that the company finds itself head to head with DoorDash, I believe that the competition will remain fierce going forward.Source: CNBCUnder these circumstances, the price that Just Eat Takeaway.com is willing to pay for Grubhub appears rather generous, probably even too generous. Just Eat Takeaway.com is in a stronger position in its core markets than Grubhub is in the US. Thus, it is well positioned to increase profitability going forward, while Grubhub is more likely to further decline in the short to medium term (and remains uncertain in the long term). Just Eat Takeaway.com is also growing considerably faster than Grubhub in terms of order volume.Orders growth Just Eat Takeaway.com; source: Just Eat Takeaway.com NVOrders growth Grubhub; source: Just Eat Takeaway.com NVFurthermore, Grubhub would account for nearly half of the combined company's total liabilities due to its more leveraged balance sheet, while only accounting for 30 percent of its equity. While that might be justified if the company was growing faster or had a stronger market position, it is unfavorable for Just Eat Takeaway.com shareholders under the given circumstances.Just Eat Takeaway.com is not present in the American market. Grubhub, on the other hand, does not have a European presence. While this means that there will probably not be any antitrust concerns, it also limits the potential for synergies. So, all in all, I believe that the company is significantly overpaying for Grubhub under the terms of the agreement.All in all, the acquisition of Grubhub at the proposed price is not only risky but also rather expensive. Therefore, I do not think that this deal is a good deal from the perspective of Just Eat Takeaway.com's shareholders.For Grubhub shareholders, on the other hand, it is of course an opportunity to diversify their holding at an attractive valuation (provided the share price of Just Eat Takeaway.com does not take too much of a hit)."

Click here to find out more »Grubhub (GRUB) desperately needs to complete a merger to ensure its long-term viability. Luckily, Uber (UBER) has reportedly been in merger discussions with Grubhub, but a deal is far from done. Grubhub’s CEO has said that Uber’s offer price is too low, and there is speculation that a merger between these two food delivery giants could spur significant regulatory scrutiny. That being said, Grubhub’s longevity as a key player in the growing $94B food delivery market is hinged on its ability to consolidate with a competitor, such as Uber Eats, in order to survive the industry’s fierce competitive dynamics and the poor scalability of its business model. Investors would be wise to keep an eye on the merger’s developments, and if a deal can’t be reached, they should sell the stock as quickly as they can.Since March 21, Grubhub’s stock price has soared over 75%, primarily based on the news of a potential merger with Uber. Uber’s most current offer values Grubhub at approximately $65 per share. For a stock that was trading near $30 per share as of the end of March, Grubhub investors should be cheering at this offer price. However, Grubhub’s CEO has balked at the offer and is greedily asking for more during a time when Grubhub’s fundamentals are faltering.Source: Yahoo! Finance stock chartsThe food delivery business is becoming increasingly unattractive as aggressive competition builds in an industry that requires billions of dollars of marketing spend per year to stay top of mind with consumers. It is no secret that consumers have several delivery options at their fingertips, all with non-existent switching costs. This has created brand-agnostic consumers who only care about paying the lowest delivery fee for the commoditized service. Brands have struggled to differentiate themselves in the eyes of consumers and, in turn, their restaurant partners. On top of this, Google recently announced that its popular Google Maps app will soon have a feature that allows restaurants to highlight their preferred delivery platform, which will only intensify competition. These industry features are classic warning signs that an inevitable price war may be afoot: high upfront capital costs with little promise to recoup this capital if the business fails, brand-agnostic customers with low switching costs, and a commoditized service.Source: Google Maps’ current options for mobile order food deliveryA closer look at Grubhub’s revenue per order trends over time gives investors a clue that a price war could emerge in the food delivery industry. Grubhub’s daily average orders, a key metric utilized by management to gauge the health of the business, had grown ~14% on average over the last three years. However, an analysis of Grubhub’s most recent 10-Q will leave a sour taste in investors’ mouths – daily average orders actually fell ~1% in Q1 2020 as compared to last year. While average revenue per order grew by a reasonable clip, if daily average orders continue to fall, then management will have few options other than decreasing price to sustain the revenue growth that investors expect.As if a potential price war wasn’t scary enough, the food delivery business model isn’t meaningfully scalable. Food delivery companies must rely on humans (at least for now) who can only deliver a maximum of two to three orders per hour, at best, due to travel times and to prevent food from going cold. These delivery lag times force companies to hire more and more delivery personnel to satisfactorily fulfill a growing number of orders. Because food delivery consumers are so fickle, one bad experience with a long delivery time or cold food from their favorite restaurant could cause consumers to quickly blacklist the company.As a result, Grubhub has experienced rapidly increasing direct costs associated with providing its independent delivery network. By analyzing these costs on a per order basis, investors can see just how bloated Grubhub has become. Direct costs per order have increased by ~31% on average over the last four years, and they have more than doubled since 2017. This explosion in direct costs has led to a 21 percentage point decline in margin per order over the last four years. Even more alarming, this margin deterioration has been getting worse over time.Grubhub will continue to experience slowing revenue growth unless the company burns more cash on sales and marketing to stay top of mind with consumers and drive order volume growth. Further, these orders will continue to have lower and lower margins unless management can avoid a price war and reduce costs.These disturbing trends should trouble investors and they necessitate a big change in order to buoy Grubhub’s stock price – Grubhub must merge with a competitor to relieve potential future downward pricing pressure and to cut redundant overhead to improve operating margins. If a deal can be made and regulators eventually approve the potential transaction, analysts have estimated that a merger between Grubhub and Uber could generate $300 million in cost savings for the two companies. Additionally, the transaction would give the merged companies an estimated 55% market share in the third-party food delivery industry and allow them to ensure short- to medium-term price stability.If Grubhub approves a deal to merge with Uber, there will undoubtedly be significant regulatory scrutiny given the deal's potential for “pandemic profiteering” that has been widely criticized by public officials recently. Additionally, a merged company with 55% market share will almost certainly raise antitrust issues due to the potential for increased prices for consumers. The food delivery business has already recently come under fire regarding its pricing policies.Investors will be wise to keep an eye on the merger talks and any regulatory roadblocks; it is my opinion that while Grubhub needs a large-scale merger to thrive in the crowded food delivery space, regulators will likely prevent the transaction from completing for the aforementioned reasons. This thwarted merger attempt will cause Grubhub’s stock price to crater as its delivery margins will continue to plummet over time. The long-term outlook of the industry is not favorable for a company that has been struggling to meaningfully differentiate itself. This stock is a sell, and I recommend investors underweight Grubhub."

The biggest risk being one of these companies joining the fray after consolidation between GrubHub and another big player in the sector.Google now offers online food-ordering via Food Ordering with Google powered by the ChowNow platform. Analyst Dan Niles believes Google was the cause of the GrubHub order declines starting in August and might force Uber Eats out of the business.For now, the Google platform uses other food delivery services and takes a 10% marketing fee for providing the orders, but nothing prevents the firm from entering the delivery space when the economics are right. GrubHub is rightfully fighting back by avoiding working with Google in order to maintain relationships with the 140,000 partner restaurants, but the move is coming at a large market share hit.Naturally, the company is looking for a strategic deal as the profit picture has slipped. The company says it isn't for sale and hints at the possibility of being an acquirer.Since the fateful Q3 report, analysts have cut GrubHub EPS estimates to a meager $0.22 this year. The group doesn't have the online food ordering and delivery service surpassing the $0.79 EPS estimate for 2019 anytime soon.Data by YChartsIn essence, the business has only gotten worse since the company went public. The stock is now worth $5 billion and investors have to question what company would pay a 20% premium and bid $6 billion for GrubHub.Possibly the only logical acquirer in the sector is Amazon while other players might lurk around. The space has no moat to support anybody rushing in to pay $6 billion for GrubHub which famously just discussed the major problem in the sector was promiscuous consumers.Consolidation just doesn't solve the problem with Google and Amazon lurking. The next time the stock rallies on a rumor of a buyout investors need to unload shares.The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub is no longer in control of their destiny with Google entering the space. Sell the stock on any major rallies here above $50."
4347150,102048,2020-05-13T12:47:44-04:00,The the merger with Uber does seem to make perfect sense for both Uber and Grubhub.Uber Eats needs Grubhub to grow and Grubhub needs Uber to survive.We see an all-stock offer would be best structure for the deal given there need for preserve liquidity.,"I have been thinking of doing a quick write up on Grubhub (GRUB) and now is the perfect time for this given the credible rumour swirling that Uber (UBER) is seeking to acquire Grubhub. In our view, the merger with Uber does seem to make perfect sense for both. We see it as two Davids merging to become a Goliath. The shares responded positively to the news of the merger. On the day before the announcement, the market capitalization for Grubhub and Uber were ~$5.6 and ~$56.2 billion each as of market close on Tuesday, 12th May. We examine why this deal makes sense for both.Understanding The industryIntense competition, minimal differentiation: Competition in the food delivery space is tight and promotional activities have been high. The four big companies are Postmates, DoorDash, Uber Eats (by Uber Technologies) and Grubhub. Looking at the overall spending data from Edison Trends of the US delivery market as of April 2020, Doordash gets 47% of the market, Uber Eats has 26% and GrubHub has 23%.Source: Edison TrendsThere is also very little differentiation in this space so customers are wont to shop around for good deals and as such loyalty is not guaranteed. Stickiness has declined markedly. For instance, from Q1 2018 to Q1 2020, the percentage of customers who do not use another platform for Grubhub declined from 75% to 58%. Uber's stickiness by this measure is 53%. In the words of the Grubhub CEO, these “promiscuous” customers are a pain point:A growing market with added risk factors: The pandemic has been a bit of tailwind in this industry with data from Second measure shows that in Q1 2020, meal delivery services experienced a 24% yoy growth. For context, NPD Group indicates that restaurant digital orders grew by 23% from 2016 to 2019. From recent earnings calls, there are indications that even previously reluctant restaurants have been signing up for these services in order to survive and thrive. Risks have also multiplied. Restaurants pushing back on prices charged by delivery companies. Delivery companies are also being sued because of pricing. Furthermore, several states in the US have implemented or are in the process of implementing laws like capping food delivery fees and classifying their workers as employees, not contractors. Costs are rising as a result and as such,With aggressive competition and added risk factors, there have been talks of consolidation within the industry. The unit economics here make the most sense if you have a large market share hence UberEats’s desire to exit markets where it is not the top dog or thereabouts. The easiest way to grow market share seems to be buying competitors as seen when DoorDash bought Caviar for $410 million last year. Last year, the Financial Times reported that DoorDash and Uber Eats had considered a merger.Grubhub is the earliest of these food delivery apps. Their focus for growth has been on small diners as opposed to established brands due to unit economics and scalability:This has helped them grow in such areas like New York City where it is dominant. However, it has been losing market share rapidly overall and has fallen from first to third place:It has not helped that customer loyalty which was key in their early success has faded as newcomers shift from platform to platform as the CEO indicated earlier. Even the CEO acknowledges it is hard to make a profit in the delivery business:For Q1 2020, revenues were up 12% yoy to $363.0 million while the net loss per diluted share improved from by $0.07 per diluted share to $(0.36) per diluted share yoy. In general, though, their performance has no been anything to write home about and as such, it has been a painful ride for investors. Last year alone, GrubHub shares were down 36% compared to the S&P 500 which soared ~29%. The news of the acquisition come like refreshing water in a desert to Grubhub shareholders.Uber is more well-known for its ride-sharing app which has been hard hit in this pandemic. Suddenly with the pandemic, Uber Eats has taken centre stage. There is a renewed focus on Uber Eats within the company as the CEO Dara said in the Q2 report that they are focusing ""additional resources on Uber Eats"". Uber Eats revenues were up 53% yoy on Q1 2020.In a drive to be better, Uber Eats has exited eight markets including Saudi Arabia and Egypt by June 4th which represented 1% of Uber Eats gross bookings and 4% of their adjusted loss before interest, taxes and other expenses for Q1 2020. The desire is to be the leader or runner-up in all markets in which it operates and divesting from the rest, where it stands not a chance to be a market leader.What is sometimes missed is that Uber usually gets stakes in the competitors to ensure they do not entirely miss out on the markets they exit from. For instance, when Uber sold its food-delivery business in India earlier this year (making a pre-tax gain of $154 million), they got a 9.9% stake also in the buyer Zomato who control which has a 55% share of India’s food-delivery.Source : Business InsiderUber clearly is focused on being a market leader and quits markets where the chances of success are low and double down in areas where there are high chances of success. As it buys Grubhub, Uber is doubling down on the key US market where it aims to be a market leader. Uber is aware that this kind of market is a winner takes it all kind of market. Third place gets no place in the podium.Largest US market share: A combined “UberGrab” company would have a market share of anywhere between 45 and 55% making it he largest food delivery company in the US. The company would combine the market where Grubhub has large market shares like New York with others where Uber Eats’ is a king like Miami.Data from Second MeasureReduced costs and competition: The merged company would save on costs in the process as they merge certain functions and with the reduced competition giving them a shot at profitability. Should they retain their respective brands, there is also the chance of tapping into the “promiscuous” customers” with the two brands house under one name.The CEO has not been very enthusiastic of a merger before but has been keen on saying it can only be done if the price is right:Allow us to speculate on what the right price could be. Bloomberg suggested it could be an all-cash deal while WSJ said it in all-stock offer. Although Uber had cash and cash equivalents of around ~8.2 B which could easily finance the deal, both companies need cash currently so the best structure for the deal is an all-stock swap. Uber Eats is growing and needs cash. Grub’s enterprise value stands at a princely 32.6 times last year’s adjusted Ebitda, double that of the S&P Restaurants Index.Worryingly, insiders have sold an alarming 24m worth of stocks in the past two years with only purchases of the only 1.2m giving a net purchase of 22.8m. The selling price range for the past 1 year has been between $34.56 and $78.89. Further, in the last 2 years, there have only been only 3 instances of insiders purchasing shares at prices of between $33.31 and $80.26. That can give us a rough idea as to a good pricing range for the deal.The WSJ suggested that Grubhub is asking for an exchange ratio of 2.15. Taking that to be the high end of the valuation and knowing that the price of Uber on Monday was $31.67, we get a valuation of ~$68 per share (~6.3 billion total valuation). Grubhub closed on Monday at $46.79, therefore, this offer represents a premium of 45%. For context, the all-time high for the stock was 146.73 (Sept 2018) and the 52-week high-low range has been 80.25-29.35. The markets responded positively to the deal with both stocks' prices going up.It is not the first time that Grubhub shares have risen because they have been reportedly been linked to a merger. We would, therefore, be cautious in getting into Grubhub merely because of the links to Uber Eats. The difference this time is though Uber is a motivated buyer, especially with its other business area of rides reeling presently. It might be time to adapt to survive and food delivery might be the straw it needs to hold on to.There is also the high chance of negative publicity this deal can generate given the swift negative response from some lawmakers. The deal would create a dominant player in the market and would likely attract regulatory scrutiny especially given the timing of the deal. Also, don't rule out other potential buyers like DoorDash jumping in to make a bid.This is a deal that would not only ensure survival for both but also ensure they thrive as the market leaders."

Active diners are up only 28% y/y in Q4, versus 29% y/y growth in Q3. Hopes of re-acceleration are slim.Perhaps even worse, daily average grubs also fell to 8% y/y, slowing two points from last quarter's 10% y/y growth.GrubHub's below-consensus EBITDA outlook for 2020 is also likely to rankle investors in a profit-oriented market.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.The past year has been a huge struggle for GrubHub (GRUB). And beyond just GrubHub, too - the entire on-demand sector has seen immense pressure from both a business angle as well as investor sentiment. In the past, investors easily bought into these companies' promises of revolutionizing industries from transportation to dining and growing to become trillion-dollar companies. But now, owing to a new shift in the markets that has prioritized unit economics and profitability, the likes of Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), and GrubHub are all down. The passage of bills like California's AB 5, which forbids these companies from classifying their drivers as contractors and has increased costs for both the companies and their customers (us), puts further pressure that may upend these companies' entire business models. Amid this tough backdrop, GrubHub has failed to stir up enough growth to excite investors, and is certainly not doing wonders on the profitability side either. Last quarter, immediately after reporting third-quarter results, GrubHub sank to a new all-time low around $33 on management commentary that Daily Active Grub (NYSEARCA:DAG) growth was trending poorly. Since then, however, overall market optimism has lifted shares of GrubHub back to pre-Q3 highs:Data by YChartsThe question for investors now: is it time to let go of GrubHub and lock in the gains from last quarter, or does the recovery still have steam?GrubHub's fourth-quarter results offer hints at the direction that the company's fundamentals are headed. The cliff notes version: not great. Despite the rapid rise in GrubHub's market cap since last quarter, the same issues that worried investors back then are still lingering. In my view, holding GrubHub is an extremely risky play for 2020, and one that's not worth the potential reward. The company is facing incredible competition from both established giants like Uber and lesser-known startups like Postmates. Though many observers expect industry consolidation at some point this year, as it currently stands these companies don't have sufficient scale to operate at meaningful profits. Ever since the WeWork (WE) fallout last fall, and the ensuing round of layoffs in Silicon Valley and beyond in a push for ""belt-tightening"", investors' desire to see healthy bottom lines has never been greater. This isn't something GrubHub can deliver.Investors shouldn't bid up GrubHub shares on the hopes of industry consolidation or a takeover. In GrubHub's most recent earnings call, CEO Matt Maloney specifically quashed rumors that the company was in sale talks:Though I was previously bullish on GrubHub when shares were lower, I'm reversing course and staying on the sidelines while GrubHub is in the ~$50s. At these levels, GrubHub carries more risk than it's worth, and the fundamentals aren't strong enough to support the share price.Like with any consumer internet company, the first question we have to ask in assessing its healthy is the underlying trends in users. In GrubHub's case, the trends aren't looking great. Take a look at the company's most recent metrics:Figure 1. GrubHub diner metricsSource: Grubhub Q4 earnings releaseEvery metric saw deceleration this quarter. Active diners grew only 28% y/y to 22.6 million, decelerating one point from last quarter's 29% y/y growth (and the quarter before that, diners had grown at 30% y/y). Again, competition and choice are the biggest headwinds here. These days, consumers have a wealth of options to choose from for on-demand dining - and as GrubHub itself noted when announcing that diner trends began decaying in August, consumers have exhibited virtually no loyalty to any particular company.Instead, consumers are making decisions based on deals (for example, UberEats has offered 10% off orders over $40 throughout February). Independent restaurants have also started their own promotions - Chipotle (CMG), for example, is offering free delivery on Sundays throughout the month of February. The array of promotions and offers is mind-boggling; consumers sticking to just one company like Grubhub would miss out.GrubHub has, of course, turned to a tried-and-true method of retaining customers: rolling out a loyalty program. In September of last year, GrubHub rolled out its ""Perks"" program - but even this isn't a new invention; GrubHub needed a loyalty program to compete against Uber, whose UberCash rewards can be applied either to UberEats orders or Uber rides. Alongside the decay in diner growth, Daily Average Grubs also decelerated - slowing to 8% y/y growth to 502,600, down from 10% y/y growth in Q3. Even more concerning is the fact that in Q2, DAG growth had clocked in at 16% y/y - twice the rate of this quarter.Likewise, gross food sales - the measure of all transactions on GrubHub's platform - fell to 13% y/y growth, down from 15% y/y growth in the prior quarter.GrubHub's biggest answer to its deceleration in food sales is to increase the number of partners on its platform so that consumers have the broadest array of options possible, especially with national partners like Yum! Brands (YUM). To GrubHub's credit, its almost certainly has the most extensive menu of restaurants in any U.S. city. But these efforts, to date, haven't resulted in a re-acceleration in diner growth.Companies like GrubHub rely on scale to survive. You can't run a small network of drivers across dozens of U.S. cities and expect to turn a profit. Part of GrubHub's hope was that it would garner enough critical mass to drive down unit costs and improve its bottom line. But as we've seen with similar business models like Blue Apron (APRN), a lack of sufficient growth can kill these hopes and shrivel companies down to a fraction of their former market values.FY19 was a reality-check year for GrubHub's profitability. GrubHub's adjusted EBITDA in FY19 fell -17% y/y to $186.2 million. This also represents a squeezing of EBITDA margins from 22.2% in FY18 to just 14.1% in FY19 - a huge 810bps contraction.Figure 2. Adjusted EBITDA trendsSource: Grubhub Q4 earnings releasePerhaps what's even worse is that GrubHub's guidance picture doesn't give us any reassurance that the situation will improve in 2020. Take a look at that guidance update below:Figure 3. FY20 guidance updateSource: Grubhub Q4 earnings releaseGrubHub is calling for ""at least"" $100 million in adjusted EBITDA next year. If we take that forecast literally, this implies that adjusted EBITDA will fall in nearly half this year - as well as sinking to mid-single digit margins.Appetite for these kinds of companies - slowing growth, waning margins - is precarious in the markets at the moment. And with the looming threat of regulation like California AB 5 potentially being replicated in other states and pushing costs up further, GrubHub's situation isn't likely to improve.GrubHub is a company that is desperately trying to find footing in a changing environment. Avoid this stock in the near term."
4316104,99986,2020-01-10T01:11:43-05:00,"GrubHub massively underperformed the S&P 500 last year, with a (-) 36% return vs. the market's strong double-digit performance.Revenue growth rates continue to erode, with the company's quarterly revenue growth rate expected to slip to low double-digits for FY-2020.Earnings estimates have revised significantly lower from $1.90 to $0.22 for FY-2020 and this made the company significantly more expensive.I continue to see the stock as an Avoid, and believe a rally above the $60.00 level would be an opportunity to lighten up exposure for investors.","It's been an exciting start to 2020 for GrubHub (GRUB) investors, with a 12% return in the first five trading days, and a much-needed reprieve from 2019's dismal performance. While the reports of a potential sale have pushed the stock higher, for the time being, the fundamentals for GrubHub continue to remain under pressure. Lukewarm projections for industry growth and deceleration in DAGs [Daily Average Grubs] prompted analysts to slash earnings estimates by nearly 90% for FY-2020, down to $0.22 in annual EPS from $1.90 previously. This put a severe dent in the value-play thesis, with the stock now trading at a forward earnings multiple of over 250. Based on this, I continue to see the stock as an Avoid and would view the $60.00 level as an opportunity to lighten up exposure for investors. (Source: MoneyInc.com)GrubHub reported its quarterly results in October, and there wasn't a lot to like about the report. While GrubHub added 900,000 new active diners in the quarter, the company also revealed in its shareholder letter that newer customers are coming at a lower quality, with DAGs well below its expectations. Management believes that newer customers are more promiscuous with peers in the food-delivery space, and this was shown by only 10% DAG growth year over year. This represents a 600-basis point sequential decline from the 16% DAG growth in Q2, and an even further deceleration from the 19% year-over-year growth in Q1. (Source: NRN.com)Also, GrubHub has concluded that the supply innovations in the takeout industry have played out, and the company expects the annual growth to slow long term to a low double-digit growth rate. This is not ideal given that there's increased competition from names like Uber (UBER). Still, GrubHub's goal is to leverage what it believes is a significant head-start in loyalty technology and tools to become the #1 go-to diner. We've seen evidence of this from its continued partnerships over the past year, with new partners like Shake Shack (SHAK), Taco Bell (YUM), Panera Bread, and many other large enterprise brands. Unfortunately, this is going to require significant investment, which is what's a partial driver of the lower earnings expected in FY-2020. GrubHub believes that its competitors cannot afford to make similar-sized investments as they're being pressured by investors to move to profitability. Therefore, GrubHub is undoubtedly making a strategic move to further distance itself from its competitors at a time when they are partially handicapped in the investment department due to a priority for bottom-line growth. This makes complete sense and is certainly a wise strategy, but it has weighed on GrubHub's bottom line materially, as shown by revisions in analysts' estimates. Let's take a closer look below:(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)As we can see in the chart above of annual EPS, GrubHub's annual EPS is expected to slide over 40% year over year from FY-2018 to FY-2019 estimates of $0.77, and is likely to drop off a cliff in FY-2020. Earnings estimates for FY-2020 have plunged from $1.90, representing significant earnings growth, to $0.22, a 70% drop in annual EPS year over year. This is a massive hit to the company's profitability and has put an enormous dent in GrubHub's earnings trend. While FY-2021 annual EPS estimates are sitting at $0.59, which would represent over 150% growth year over year, this is only attainable due to how depressed FY-2020 earnings are expected to be. Therefore, this significant growth rate should be discounted.If we move over to quarterly revenue growth rates, there are not many things to like here either. GrubHub's previous average revenue growth rate in FY-2018 was 48%, but quarterly revenue growth will likely end the year at low double-digit levels. GrubHub's Q3 revenue came in at $322.1 million, reflecting 30% year-over-year growth, but Q4 2019 estimates are forecasting only $324.2 million in revenue. This would translate to only 13% growth year over year, and would represent a 1700-basis point sequential deceleration in the quarterly revenue growth rate. Worse, this would reduce the company's growth rate to a low-growth level, from a prior title as a high-growth stock in FY-2018.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we look out further to FY-2020 levels, things aren't likely to improve much. Q1 2020 revenue estimates are currently pegged at $362.5 million, with Q2 2020 forecasts at $361.1 million. These would represent quarterly revenue growth rates of 12% and 11% year over year, respectively. While it's a minor silver lining that at least revenue growth looks to be trying to trough out at low double-digit levels, this is a massive deceleration from prior sales growth.In summary, GrubHub's annual EPS in FY-2020 is forecasted to fall off a cliff, and revenue growth rates continue to trend in the wrong direction. While this was to be expected given competition heating up over the past two years, I do not believe many analysts were modeling low double-digit growth for FY-2020. Therefore, this has come as a shock to many analysts, as well as investors. For growth stock investors, GrubHub has completely fallen off the radar and has given up its prior title as a growth company based on forward estimates. There's no question GrubHub could remain the leader in the space, but it's the leader in an industry with increasing competition and lower growth long term.(Source: Koyfin.com)The biggest issue stemming from this massive drop-off in profitability is the fact that it's moved GrubHub from a bit of a value play to an overvalued play almost overnight. While GrubHub was trading at less than 30x forward earnings in mid-2019, one could argue that GrubHub was beginning to get attractive from a valuation standpoint. It was clear that growth was dropping off, but a forward P/E ratio of 30 for an industry leader with 20% revenue growth is relatively reasonable. However, after annual EPS was slashed from $1.90 to $0.22, the forward P/E ratio has soared to over 250x, an exorbitant valuation for even the strongest growth companies in the market.Unfortunately, this massive spike in the forward P/E ratio has exacerbated by the 70% rally that GrubHub has seen since December. There are few stocks in the market currently trading at such a lofty valuation, and I would argue that GrubHub is insanely overvalued here, even if we use FY-2021 earnings estimates of $0.59. Based on $0.59 in annual EPS for FY-2021, GrubHub is currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of over 90, and this is on earnings, which is still more than a year away, and subject to significant revisions. Therefore, GrubHub is neither a growth stock at current levels or a value play after this rally. Instead, it's a leader in an industry where competitors are fighting tooth and nail over a slice of the take-out industry pie.(Source: TC2000.com)If we move over to the technical picture, GrubHub remains below its 20-month moving average (red line), and this rally has done nothing to improve the technical picture. The 20-month moving average is one of the more reliable barometers of the long-term trend, and stocks below the 20-month moving average are generally best to avoid. This is because they are in clear intermediate downtrends, and it's rarely wise to buy a stock in an intermediate downtrend if the market itself is in an intermediate uptrend and hitting new highs. The reason for this is that trends tend to persist unless there's a significant catalyst to change things. In GrubHub's case, the fundamentals have only gotten worse since the stock lost its 20-month moving average near the $75.00 level.Zooming in to the daily chart below, we can see that prior support for GrubHub was at the $60.00 level, and the stock is now heading back towards this level after a sharp rally following its Q3 report. Unfortunately, prior support often becomes new resistance, and GrubHub is also heading into its downtrend line off of its all-time high. These are two areas of strong resistance which are likely to keep a lid on the stock. Therefore, I would argue that any bounces that cannot reclaim the $60.00 level on two consecutive weekly closes are merely noise, and oversold rallies within a downtrend.(Source: TC2000.com)To summarize, I see zero reasons to chase GrubHub at current levels and believe the wiser move is lightening up exposure if we head above the $60.00 level. While GrubHub may be the leader in its industry, competitors moving into the space, coupled with an industry-wide slowdown, has taken out a bite out of GrubHub's forward growth. At a forward earnings multiple of over 250, it's hard to argue that GrubHub is cheap, and it is clear the company is no longer a growth stock with low double-digit sales growth. I see the reward to risk as balanced at best at current levels and unattractive above the $60.00 level."
4302668,105186,2019-11-05T13:06:27-05:00,"Grubhub's demand generation business has a plethora of competitive threats; not just direct competitors like DoorDash and Uber Eats.Grubhub's high commission rate adds high variable expenses to restaurants, traditional forms of demand generation are more practical.Grubhub's market share slide has only worsened.No on-demand food delivery service is immune from poor economics.Ultimately, Grubhub has no competitive advantages, and could easily trade lower.","On May 18, I wrote an article titled ""The Grubhub (GRUB) Fear Is Justified."" Since, the stock has fallen about 45% following a disastrous quarter.My summarized points were as follows:The primary shocker from Grubhub's latest, tremendously bad quarter is the revenue guidance for the next quarter. It is worth a brief mention, as the rest of the article will be reviewing my previous thesis to which only more supportive evidence has emerged. I will also discuss in detail the challenge of the company being able to generate cash flow to justify the valuation moving forward.But, on the revenue front, Grubhub expects revenue of $315-325 million in Q4, well short of Wall Street's $387 million expectation. The midpoint implies just 11% growth as the company appears to have hit a major roadblock.The idea of Grubhub being a demand generation service appeared lost on the market until the most recent quarter.SourceIn essence, the delivery business has no pure economic value to Grubhub shareholders. Its only value is increasing orders through the platform which is where Grubhub claims its value is. Grubhub's demand generation business is also subject to numerous competitive threats. Grubhub is far from the only tool that restaurants can use to drum up demand. Yelp (YELP) has a similar model, the company uses reviews to help potential customers assess the quality of dining choices. Grubhub's valued-added service is delivery as opposed to reviews.Along with Yelp, Grubhub competes with traditional advertising through Facebook (FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) as a means of demand generation. Advertising expenses are easier for businesses to manage than Grubhub commission. Commissions can range from 15% to as high as 30% for sponsored listings. The value proposition is questionable as opposed to traditional demand generation methods where spending is more at the discretion of restaurant owners. A reoccurring variable expense crunches restaurant's margins. Focusing on acquiring customers without forking over high commissions to Grubhub would be ideal.In addition to these alternatives, Grubhub has the typical competitors we think of, such as DoorDash (DOORD), Uber Eats (UBER) and Postmates (POSTM). Even Grubhub's demand generation business is commoditized when looking amongst the fray of competitors. For example, Subway, the largest fast-food chain by store count, has partnered with all three to offer delivery service to customers.SourceSince May, Grubhub's share has continued on a downward trajectory. Despite a recent bounce, Grubhub's share of on-demand food platforms has shrunk from near 45% in 2017 to below 25% in 2019. While Grubhub is generating some cash, unlike its competition, venture-capital backed DoorDash infusing marketing dollars to gain share only represents the problems of the industry.Competitive advantage is a top qualitative metric for long-term investors. Being able to sleep at night not having to worry about competition eroding market share is a hallmark of a great investment. There is no possible way seeing how quickly Grubhub's share has eroded that investors can be confident in the business moving forward. When a competitor like DoorDash is able to enter the market and essentially buy market share, it is clear that Grubhub has no proprietary technology or network that gives it a defensible moat.DoorDash's $12.6 billion valuation in May is also reflective of excessive optimism in the space. The poor economics are not unique to Grubhub. But, if we decide to assign any value to the industry it would be done by market share. McKinsey estimates the food delivery market to be about $93 billion. Even if on-demand platforms took the entirety of the delivery market at a 15% commission, they would be fighting for 14 billion in revenue.Reasonably speaking, we can assign the on-demand platforms a 10 billion dollar revenue potential considering some restaurants will opt to perform their own delivery services. Given the margin crunching nature of food-delivery, we can assume about 5% of revenue will be cash flow generated for the delivery services. This leaves the competition slugging it out for 500 million dollars of cash generation. Given Grubhub's market share currently at 25%, that leaves us with 125 million dollars in cash flow. This results in a price to cash flow ratio of 24.64x, still expensive given the nature of the business and how limited Grubhub will be going forward. There is no rational argument for Grubhub trading back up to a $12 billion plus valuation.Data by YChartsThe bull argument that Grubhub is the only profitable model in the space has very little merit to the overall picture. This is a backward looking short-term metric. Considering our assessment of the market as a whole, Grubhub could very easily fall another 40%. A 15x projected cash flow multiple at a $1.875 billion valuation seems more than fair given the circumstances. This gives shares a $20.53 price tag and more pain ahead for shareholders.There is no reasonable catalyst for Grubhub to command previous valuation multiples. The market has witnessed a perceived star fall from grace. The underlying economics have not improved and Grubhub's position in the market has eroded. Grubhub is a lesson in avoiding stocks with great expectations, and the potential pitfalls in unproven business models. Avoiding Grubhub would be in alignment with investing by Warren Buffett's first principle, ""never lose money.""As Grubhub mentioned in its shareholder letter, the economics of delivering food to diners is not a highly cash generative activity. What's worse for Grubhub is that its share is deteriorating in a poor market. Thus, the argument of competitive threat is really only a reflection of the one true underlying structural problem of the business, that is, Grubhub's true business is delivering food.Restaurants have a number of better tools to generate traffic and orders. Grubhub's commission rates are already excessive, there is not enough additional value to be had through the Grubhub platform. Grubhub does not solve a problem, it remedies a small annoyance by excessively charging restaurants. Given the expensive nature of moving items from one place to another, Grubhub's margins are slim even though its fees are high. I view Grubhub as a strong avoid, the latest quarter only makes the conviction stronger."
4310165,105510,2019-12-02T18:48:32-05:00,Grubhub's unit economics are significantly deteriorating.GRUB lacks a competitive moat amid deteriorating industry dynamics.Not do I see much of a case for a takeout at current valuations.I am not buying this dip.,"Following the pullback in the aftermath of its Q3 results, Grubhub (GRUB) valuations may appeal on revenue-based multiples such as EV/Revenue. However, I would caution against “buying the dip” here. It is unclear to me if the business model is viable, even in the long run. To be clear, I do not think Grubhub’s misfortunes are entirely of its own doing; its quarterly industry commentary pointed toward secular challenges across the industry, which I believe is reflective of the challenges of operating in food delivery. I see little reason for a multiple re-rating from here; nor do I see an acquisition scenario materializing at the $197/active diner implied by current valuations.If I could surmise GRUB's Q3 results, it would be that the growth outlook and forward profitability are becoming significantly challenged. The reset of 2020 expectations was shocking - adjusted EBITDA is now projected to reach ""at least"" $100mn, which is far below the already weak 2019E guidance.Source: Grubhub Historical Company ReportsAs its shareholder letter lays out, the disappointing numbers were down to a number of issues, most of which seem to be secular rather than one-off.. Firstly, deteriorating new customer dynamics, with newer diners trending worse than prior cohorts on frequency, loyalty, and retention. This ties in with management's commentary on deteriorating industry dynamics in the shareholder letter, with increased industry-wide competition leading to bleak growth prospects (""low double- digits growth"").With competitive intensity on the rise, GRUB has identified restaurant inventory and diner loyalty as key areas of focus. Management is looking to build supply by onboarding more non-partnered restaurants on its platform, aiming to more than double the number available by 2020.Meanwhile, to differentiate itself and address the deterioration in new diner retention, the company plans to utilize its industry-low fees and direct point-of-sale integrations to support its loyalty push. Supporting this initiative is the strong diner rewards numbers through Perks:The key implication here is that delivery economics are materially worsening as companies' investment needs escalate. Amid a deteriorating industry backdrop, GRUB simply does not have an economic moat to shied itself from the race. The company is investing in building out its sales team to expand supply (by adding more restaurants onto the platform) while simultaneously being engaged in a subsidy war with well-funded competitors such as UberEats to build loyalty.The issue with the food delivery investment case comes down to unit economics - with supply (delivery apps) proliferating, there simply does not seem to be any discernible network effects or first-mover advantages for incumbents to build on. Here's a particularly damning chart for Grubhub:Source: FortuneThe quote below, from the same Fortune article, frames the food delivery state of play quite well, in my view:If the food business seems like a difficult, overcrowded proposition, food delivery might be even worse - there has been little evidence that well-funded market leaders have been able to build in any switching costs into their business model. This applies to both diners (demand side) and restaurants (supply side). Restaurants have shown little interest in going exclusive with any one platform, and are instead, signing up with multiple delivery platforms to maximize customer leads. There are, after all, no upfront costs in signing up. GrubHub sits in a particularly precarious position. It competes with both extremely well-funded industry participants with a huge captive ecosystem (Amazon, Uber) as well as leaner startups (Postmates, Doordash). The key to the GRUB bull case lies in the total addressable market (also known as TAM"") argument, which has some credence. The sheer size of the overall food delivery market, coupled with the high purchase frequency means the market opportunity is vast (GRUB believes the number is $200bn/yr, as specified in its shareholder letter). But we have seen this movie before, with the likes of online travel etc. The key to profitable growth (industry-wide consolidation and rationalization) is well-known but the time and incentive required for such a consolidation to materialize is the key question. There has been little sign of industry discipline thus far, and by GRUB's admission in its shareholder letter, things are getting worse.Historically, the GRUB growth strategy has leaned heavily on an acquisitive streak. In the last few years, the company has splurged on Eat24, Restaurant on the Run, Delivered Dish, DiningIn, and LABite, among others. The question now, however, is what next? The food delivery M&A landscape seems exhausted, with little in the way of remaining acquisition targets of scale.Source: CBInsightsGiven the absence of network effects exhibited by GrubHub’s business thus far, I struggle to see the case for GRUB to be an acquisition target down the line. At an EV of ~$197/active diner today, the price to acquire GrubHub’s users is still exceptionally pricey. With little in the way of an economic moat, I see little reason why the likes of Uber, for example, would buyout GRUB for a premium, instead of simply building out a network organically.Source: GRUB shareholder letter, Seeking Alpha, Own EstIncorporating the implications from the latest quarterly update, I believe Grubhub has room to move lower. I hold a price target of $22 on the stock, based on a 20x EBITDA multiple to account for the increased investment requirements, though the bulls are getting the benefit of doubt here considering this is still notably above many Internet peers. The EBITDA multiple could well compress lower if bulls lose faith in the TAM-based investment case.Source: Own Est, Company FilingsGrubhub’s recent fall from grace highlights the hazards of TAM-based investing – by ignoring the underlying unit economics, bulls seem to have underestimated the level of investments needed to generate sales, and the level of competitive intensity within the low-moat food delivery business. Though the third quarter was a timely reality check, I am still decidedly cautious on the stock. Industry dynamics, for instance, has deteriorated, with management’s bearish outlook leading me to question the sustainability of the business model and Grubhub’s ability to maintain share.Looking ahead, the competitive outlook could get a lot worse. Competitors have shown little interest in maintaining discipline, while continuing to invest heavily in technology and fulfillment, and funding subsidy-driven losses across the value chain (from diner to restaurant). I would not be buying the GRUB dip anytime soon, given the heightened execution risk as management navigates an intensely competitive space."
4304378,105486,2019-11-08T10:51:37-05:00,"GrubHub’s FY 2020 “guidance” does not factor in the required costs to compete effectively with peers.GrubHub has no choice but to shell out these costs, given its 3-sided platform model.Expect FY 2020 EPS to be deep in the red, versus consensus EPS estimates of $0.29.","BackgroundRecently, GrubHub’s stock tanked on Q3’s revenue miss, and earnings guidance which was a widely categorized as “disastrous”. In a nutshell, management admitted to underestimating competitive pressures, and succumbed to increased “investment spending” to fend of rival’s encroachment into its market share. Specifically, we point out that management’s confidence of FY 2020’s adjusted EBITDA being “well in excess of $100m” as highly unrealistic, or wildly optimistic. In previous quarters’ earnings, management has repeatedly shown the tendency to underestimate competition and downplay headwinds to growth and profitability. We are calling them out for this once more. To use CEO Matt Maloney’s own words against him: “..we’re just trying to pop those fallacies when we see them”.Higher price incentives to print more red ink than guidedTo stop losing market share, GrubHub needs to at least “match” the magnitude of price incentives shelled out by its rivals. According to data from Second Measure, GrubHub’s market share in September 2019 further declined to 30%, despite management ramping up marketing spend by $20+m per quarter since the 4th quarter of 2018. In GrubHub’s Q3 Q&A segment, its CEO mentioned: “..with all the major players expanded across the whole U.S., delivery coverage has now been commoditized. we all have roughly the same algorithm, same driver interactions, the same ETAs.. and now with non-partnered restaurant inventory becoming more prevalent, supply side is soon to be commoditized as well.”. This is an indirect admission to the validity of the bearish argument presented by those bearish on food delivery, where price competition has become the primary (if not only) value differential to platform participants, given that the current state of product differentiation between the players is next to nothing.An analysis of price incentives provided by GrubHub and Uber Eats shows a yawning gap in magnitude of spending between the two. We used Uber Eats as an industry proxy as it is a major competitor with publicly disclosed data. Using Q3 data, GrubHub’s reported all-in take rate is 23%, vs. a “no-discount” steady-state take-rate of 27% as illustrated in the company’s delivery economics. As GrubHub presents revenues post discounts, it gave up 4% of take-rate to price incentives, translating into about $56m for the quarter.(Source: Sunny Research, with inputs from company’s public disclosures)On Uber Eats’s side, we computed an estimate of $123m in price incentives for the quarter. Uber Eats reports price discounts within COGS and S&M, so we backed out the amount after deducting core expense buckets as follows:(Source: Sunny Research, with inputs from company’s public disclosures. Core COGS and Core S&M are excluding price discounting, deduced from company’s 10-Q)Note that GrubHub’s $56m is apportioned to a market share of 30%, while Uber Eats’s $123m was apportioned to 20% of market share. As a result of the spending, Uber Eats managed to maintain market share throughout the quarter, while GrubHub lost 300bps of market share. If we view Uber Eats’s spending proportion as the minimum required to maintain market share in this increasingly competitive industry, then GrubHub’s spend is grossly insufficient. At a high level, grossing up Uber’s spend to a market share of 30% would yield $185m, suggesting that GrubHub’s spending shortfall is about $129m. Since price discounts have become the only value differential for participants to engage in a particular food delivery platform, it is no wonder that GrubHub is losing market share at a rapid clip. This is not surprising, given its CEO’s condemnation and unwillingness to engage in price discounting.Given the above calculations, we see no path towards management’s expectations of “at least $100m in adjusted EBITDA in 2020”. Also outlined in the Q3 shareholder letter is GrubHub CEO’s industry assessment that “..annual growth is slowing and returning to a more normal longer-term state which we believe will settle in the low double digits, except that there are multiple players all competing for the same new diners and order growth.” To keep up with the industry’s 10+% to 20+% in revenue growth (i.e. maintain market share) will require a c.$0.5bn run-rate ($129m per quarter calculated above) of additional spend, a calculation that will yield nothing remotely close to the guided $100m in adjusted EBITDA. In fact, we think that GrubHub is likely to be deep in the red for 2020.Between a rock and a hard placeThe table stakes are high, and GrubHub has little choice but to spend. As famous short-seller Jim Chanos mentioned in a recent CNBC interview, competing with Uber (and deep-pocketed rivals) is like “being locked in a cage with a psychopath with an ax”. As GrubHub’s platform model and accompanying premium growth valuation relies entirely on the premise of achieving exponential growth via network effects, it has to choose network growth every time, even if it means deep losses. This is why we see many platform businesses spend aggressively, especially in their early years. Growth precedes profitability for the platform business, and is even more so for nascent industries like food delivery where user penetration in the U.S. is only at 29% of total addressable market. This is the classic case of prisoner’s dilemma, in what is increasingly looking like winner-takes-all market, as poor industry economics disallow for smaller players to exist. As such, GrubHub is constrained by its business model to spend for growth or approach a scenario where shareholder value is wiped out from the inability to scale its network effects.What will Softbank do? A rationalization of the competitive environment may present a risk to this thesis. Softbank’s recent WeWork fiasco has attracted much investor scrutiny, which was exacerbated by its large losses at Uber as well. As a result, Softbank has pledged to push portfolio companies to shore up profitability, which marks a shift from its previous “growth-at-all-costs” strategy. Its garguantan Vision Fund is a backer of both Uber Eats and DoorDash, which combine for a whopping 58% market share in the U.S. food delivery market (post DoorDash’s acquisition of Caviar). As both Uber Eats and DoorDash both won market share by luring platform participants with substantial price incentives, we think a strategic reversal at the top might send ripples across the competitive landscape. While we have not heard any industry updates that competitive pressures are toning down, we do not exclude the possibility of a slightly more rationalized environment in the coming quarters. However, as discussed above, we still stand by the fact that the food delivery platform model requires significant capital to scale, and scaling is an absolute necessity to drive network effects and shareholder value in the early stages.We also see another scenario this could be a positive catalyst to our thesis, which is if a potential merger of rivals happen. We have known for Softbank to push for consolidation between its portfolio companies to eliminate price competition between them, with examples of the cases being Uber and Grab in South East Asia, and Uber and Didi in China. In this scenario, scale and stronger network effects could be achieved by a potential operational consolidation of DoorDash and Uber Eats’s U.S. business, which will result in resource consolidation and more competitive pressures against a smaller GrubHub.Impact on share priceWe think that going deeper into the red will further push back the timeline to profitability, and increase the uncertainty of its eventual profitability. According to earnings consensus, it seems that the market is yet to be prepared for this. FY 2020 EPS estimates are still sitting at $0.29, a week after we saw a surge of downgrades and EPS revisions from the sell-side. As per our calculations above, we are expecting an already negative adjusted EBITDA, which translates into an even more negative EPS. Share prices should react negatively to more downside earnings surprises.TakeawayGrubHub has grossly underestimated costs required to effectively compete with rivals. Management continues to downplay the headwinds to growth and profitability. Investors should be mindful of the potential for more heavy losses to come."
4300976,104761,2019-10-31T13:30:29-04:00,"I had remained guardedly optimistic about Grubhub in the face of increased competition and decelerating revenue growth.The recent quarter showed strong growth, but increasing costs and poor revenue growth guidance have justifiably led to a blistering selloff.The problem with the food delivery space is the difficulty in developing and maintaining a strong competitive advantage. Grubhub believes it has an advantage, but that financials say otherwise.Grubhub is a leader, but costs continue to rise and things could get worse for the stock before they get better.A moat is a beautiful thing. Grubhub doesn't have one.","Grubhub (GRUB) continues to be a leading provider of food delivery, but competition is intense, costs continue to rise, and the runway for growth appears to be narrowing.The company's revenue grew 30% in Q3-19, a deceleration from Q2-19 revenue growth of 36%. While revenue growth deceleration isn't anything new to Grubhub, it was the extremely conservative revenue guidance of 9-16% for Q4-19 that really crushed the stock price 40% post-Q3 earnings.In addition to subdued guidance, profitability continues to get hammered as the company must continue to invest in marketing to attract and retain grubbers. Sales and marketing expenses were up a whopping 45% and net income was nearly wiped out this quarter.While I continue to believe that Grubhub has a strong position in an intensely competitive industry, it is unclear to me how the market will shake out or how the stock price will perform, particularly if the company can't even meet its paltry revenue growth figures next quarter. As we've seen in ride-sharing, this will probably be an industry that can support two players, though the economics of ride-share continue to be a struggle for both Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT).I believe consolidation will happen. Grubhub will likely be folded into another company, I just don't know when and I don't know at what price this will happen. Things may get worse for Grubhub before they get better.Grubhub's expenses this quarter continued the trend of Grubhub paying up to stay competitive. Ops and support costs as a percentage of revenue were 50% of revenue this quarter vs. 45% this time a year ago. And marketing expenses were 22% of revenue this quarter vs. 20% a year ago.SourceThe company believes that the best path forward is by signing up as many restaurants for its platform as possible. I believe that's true, but to get there, the company is spending more on employees to help them recruit restaurants.Additionally, CEO Matt Maloney acknowledged that commoditization of restaurant delivery is happening faster than anybody at Grubhub expected. The differentiator from Grubhub's perspective is having the largest independent restaurant roster, adding to that roster, and charging less than the competition.SourceGoing into Q4, one of the reasons revenue growth is expected to dip well below 20% is because the company will be giving away a lot of food deliveries to promote Grubhub adoption with key partners like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA). But it's not just free promos that will drive down revenue growth, Grubhub says the overall industry is heading to low double-digit revenue growth.Ultimately, Grubhub believes there will be no reason to use one of its competitors. Grubhub will have all restaurants on its platforms, it will have a loyalty program, and it will charge less than competitors. I think this is a little naive. Though the company plans to push loyalty programs for consumers while continually building out its leading restaurant roster, I don't know if that will be enough to build a sustainable competitive advantage.The company's stock has gotten hammered over the last 18 months. But with rapid revenue growth deceleration, higher expenses, and decreasing profitability, it's possible Grubhub's best days as a standalone company are behind it. If you believe Grubhub will be one of two standalone survivors in this market, the recent price dip may be an opportunity. It looks cheap on price/sales, price/cash flow, price/book. But I'm not certain restaurant delivery can be dominated by a pure play in the future. I suspect Grubhub will be acquired, but I don't know when and I don't know at what price.I had hopes for Grubhub and believed the company, and sentiment, would turn around as the company continued with its expansion. But the industry is too cut-throat. I doubt I will be investing in food delivery again."
4300627,22148,2019-10-30T19:18:18-04:00,Grubhub slashed Q4 estimates following a Q3 revenue miss.The company is no longer the leading player in an overly competitive domestic food delivery market.The stock continues to have downside risk despite the 40% dip following Q3 earnings.,"Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) achieved the rare feat of causing their shares to plunge over 40% in one day and still not offer value to new shareholders. The typical outcome of a lofty valuation multiple is the attraction of heavy competition in the space. The scenario leads to a fickle user base as the delivery service lacks a true moat and the benefits of scale. My investment thesis warned people to avoid the stock at much higher prices, and nothing has changed here until the competitive landscape improves.Image Source: Grubhub websiteThe thesis with Grubhub has always been that the market valued the company based off peak earnings in a market segment where aggressive competitors weren't going to give up on a global online food market, now targeted at approaching $200 billion in 2025. These competitors are constantly pushing into delivering items from grocery stores and pharmacies on top of some existing ridesharing programs in order to drive leverage and scale not available in food delivery alone.For several years, Grubhub appeared to survive and thrive despite the growing competition. Evidently, this concept just hit a wall as the easy expansion in the online food ordering and delivery sector maxed out. Now, restaurants and consumers are being ""promiscuous"" with unlimited market opportunities to use other services such as Uber Eats, DoorDash (DOORD), and Postmates (POSTM) with limited distinguishing factors at this point.The company has seen a decline in metrics around Daily Average Grubs (DAGs) despite growing active diners. In Q3, active diners per DAGs jumped to 46 from 39 last Q3. Grubhub needs to attract more and more diners to guarantee new orders.Source: Grubhub Q3'19 shareholder letterCustomer loyalty doesn't exist because customers have more restaurant options now on other platforms, and what matters the most is which restaurant partners with which food delivery service. The end result is that Grubhub has to invest more to develop the online platform for restaurants that aren't partners while facing more pressure on fees.The company slightly missed Q3 estimates with revenues growing 30% to reach $322 million. The online food delivery service did miss revenue targets by a decent $7 million, but the real issue was guidance. Grubhub guided to the following Q4 misses:Rarely will a company go from a position of generating solid EBITDA margins in the 20% range down to only 6% in one quarter. Even crazier, Grubhub projected the ability to grow adjusted EBITDA per order in 2020 to $2.00 versus the Q3 level of $1.28 despite this massive cut.Huge questions exist based on the order trends highlighted in the fewer DAGs per active diner, if Grubhub could actually generate such EBITDA margins per order and not lose substantial future business opportunities.While one can possibly argue Grubhub will return to 20% EBITDA margins and someday turn $2 billion in annual sales into $400 million in adjusted EBITDA, the current market climate questions whether this is realistic. Bloomberg highlights an industry looking for consolidation in 2020 where Grubhub isn't the leading player regardless of being the only profitable U.S. player.The top 5 players shaping the industry in 2020 are as follows: Uber (NYSE:UBER), DoorDash (DOORD), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Just Eat (OTC:JSTLF) and Deliveroo. The top 3 are the industry players the most to worry about in the U.S. along with Postmates.While not wanting to stay bearish on Grubhub during a downcycle and a much lower stock price, the market only appears now to be rightsizing the lack of economies of scale in the food delivery market. The company spent the Q3 shareholder letter to shift the focus on the lack of scale in a delivery business reliant on a point-to-point system unlike other transportation services that use a hub and spoke method for operating efficiencies.Grubhub oddly made the case for the stock trading at a lower multiple than traditional transportation services like Delta Air Lines (DAL) or United Parcel Service (UPS). The suggestion here is that Grubhub should eventually drift down to the P/S multiples of these historical transportation companies with greater scale and more efficient passenger or package delivery systems.Data by YChartsAt $33, Grubhub is still worth $3.0 billion. The company is achieving annual EBITDA at ~$100 million, making the stock expensive at 30x EBITDA. If the company reverted back to the 20% EBITDA margins due to a more normalized competitive position in the online food ordering and delivery market, the stock could be viewed as very cheap. The latter just appears unlikely with the money invested in Uber Eats and DoorDash along with the willingness of Amazon to spend on any growth opportunity.The key investor takeaway is that the stock just isn't appealing into the competitiveness in the sector abates via sector consolidation or a few industry players losing interest. Avoid Grubhub from now despite the stock being down $100 from the all-time highs."
4301773,55722,2019-11-02T10:38:11-04:00,Mediocre Q3 19 results and dreadful guidance.Grubhub clearly demonstrates a lack of barriers.Grubhub looks like it's entering a vicious downward cycle.This will end in an acquisition at a lower price than today.,"Grubhub (GRUB) reported reasonable Q3 2019 results compared to already lowered expectations but took expectations even further down in a clear demonstration that there are no barriers in this brutal business.Grubhub Q3 19 revenues / EPS were $322.1m / $0.01, both below consensus of $330.0m / $0.02, but not enough to trigger the share price rout of 43.3% that was experienced on Oct. 28. This came from the guidance which took already lowered expectations even further along on their downward slide. Q4 19 revenues / EBITDA are expected to be $315m – $335m (midpoint $325m) / $15m – $25m (midpoint $20m), some 16% and 75% short of forecasts, respectively. Q4 19 consensus revenue / EBITDA was $387m / $79m.The company is still growing as both active users and Q3 19 revenues increased by around 30% YoY.The problem is that the company is having to give away all of its profitability to keep that growth going in the face of brutal competition because there are no barriers to entry. Furthermore, the company freely admitted that food delivery is now fully commoditised and that its users regularly use the services of its competitors. In essence, the company has admitted that it has no barriers to entry, meaning that it's now going to be a race to the bottom where the company with the deepest pockets is likely to end up winning the market.Despite being one of the early movers, Grubhub has been unable to reach the hallowed status of being dominant in its market. This would have meant that it would have become the go-to place to buy and sell takeaway food, allowing it to increase its prices somewhat and make a good return. In order to achieve this, it would have needed to hold onto 60% market share or be at least twice the size of its nearest competitor. This remains my rule of thumb for network-based businesses which appears to be as true today as it was in 2015 when I first proposed it.To make matters worse, Grubhub is under siege from a series of venture-backed businesses (with the exception of UberEats) which effectively means they are competing with free money and do not have to show a profit. By contrast, Grubhub has to bear the harsh judgment of the market every quarter which has so far delivered a verdict that has taken 77% off the market cap since the end of August 2018. This will make restaurant owners increasingly concerned with Grubhub’s long-term viability, meaning that they will increasingly seek to list elsewhere or with multiple sites.This, in turn, will lead to further earnings misses and so on as Grubhub enters the vicious cycle of the downward spiral, meaning that there's worse to come. The net result is likely to be Grubhub being acquired for a fraction of even the current valuation.Consequently, anyone still in the shares should take the opportunity to cut their losses now as the free fall is far from over."
4315280,53922,2020-01-05T14:10:59-05:00,"Grubhub's third-quarter earnings were a wake-up call to current industry conditions of intense competition, causing the stock to drop 43%.Since then, the stock has rallied 44% off the lows.In this article, I look at why the stock dropped and what has changed since earnings.I discuss several combinations of industry players and speculate on which is most likely.","Grubhub's (GRUB) third-quarter earnings were a wake-up call. Investors were forced to face the reality that the food order and delivery market has become ultra-competitive and that Grubhub was no longer the market leader in the US. The company dramatically lowered its guidance for the fourth quarter to revenues of $315-$335 million and EBITDA of $15-$25 million, versus analyst estimates of $387 million and $79 million. The change in guidance, competitive positioning and strategy was so significant that management released a shareholder letter to communicate its views on the industry and Grubhub's positioning going forward. As a result, Grubhub's stock dropped from $58 to $33, a 43% drop.Remarkably, though, Grubhub's stock has regained much of that ground over the past two months, rallying back to $49. Its stock has risen 48% from the post-earnings low. So what has changed, if anything, to cause this increase? Or is the increase simply due to the market adjusting to an overreaction following the third-quarter results?First, I look at the points management made in its shareholder letter that caused the stock to drop. Second, I'll speculate on whether these factors have changed since earnings to justify the recent rally in the stock.Management was clear in the letter that ""supply innovations in online takeout have been played out and growth is slowing and returning to a more normal longer-term state which we believe will settle in the low double digits"". Further, management detailed that diners are ""becoming more promiscuous"" in terms of ordering on other competing online platforms.It's unlikely that either of these factors has changed since earnings.Management was clear that they did not expect delivery to ever generate profits. They wrote:This dynamic is unlikely to have changed and, if anything, Grubhub's competitors have continued exploring ways to leverage the delivery network, with Uber (UBER) eyeing courier services for retail orders in New York and DoorDash (DOORD) opening delivery-only ""ghost"" kitchens in San Francisco and other markets.Grubhub was clear in the shareholder letter that large restaurant chains are not driving profitability. It wrote:What is profitable is the marketplace business, and in particular, the marketplace business for small and medium sized restaurants. It wrote:This dynamic is what has powered Grubhub's profitability over the middle part of the decade - marketplace orders to small- and mid-sized restaurants that are either pick-up or self-delivered by the restaurant. Grubhub has benefited from this dynamic, particularly in New York City, which is dominated by small to mid-sized restaurants and is dense enough for diners to pick up orders themselves or restaurants to employ a staff to self-deliver. These characteristics are not present in any other market in the country, at least not to this degree. Grubhub may be used to the local diner in mid-town Manhattan with its own delivery crew, and surely makes a lot of profit off that customer, but that customer is unique to New York.This is a large reason why Grubhub has been bested by competitors in most cities outside of its core Northeast markets, particularly more suburban cities and cities with a higher portion of national chain restaurants. In these markets only the pizza stores typically have delivery. By offering delivery, Uber Eats and DoorDash found a way into these markets, and they haven't looked back since.Here's where we stand now in terms of market share in the major cities as of October 2019 (Source: CBNC):As you can see, Grubhub has basically lost the leadership position outside of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston. And these markets are now likely very saturated and do not offer much growth potential.This leaves Grubhub in a challenging position, which has not changed since the earnings announcement.So why the 48% rally, then, if the dynamics management outlined above haven't changed? I have two theories.First, I think some investors hope that WeWork's (WE) troubles have caused private companies generally to become more profit-focused. SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) (OTCPK:SFTBF), a part owner of DoorDash, has reportedly urged its portfolio companies to focus on a path to profitability. The hope is that Uber Eats, DoorDash and Postmates (POSTM) will be pressured to reduce their losses by reducing customer incentives or raising prices.While there may be some truth to this, I think it's likely not the end of the story. DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates gained their market share positions in food delivery by being willing to invest and it seems unlikely that they would put the brakes on investment now and cede their gains. While some may retrench from certain markets where they are not well positioned, others may increase investment in markets that they see as strategic. This poses a particular risk for Grubhub as its New York market is by far its best and most profitable market, and it would be a devastating loss if Grubhub lost significant market share there. And we know that Uber obviously has a strong driver presence in New York and is exploring retail deliveries as well, and may invest in improving its food market share as well.Second, I think investors are looking ahead to inevitable M&A in the sector. In fact, consolidation has already begun as DoorDash acquired Square's (SQ) Caviar in August. The idea here, and what I suspect has driven most of Grubhub's rally, is the idea that Grubhub is a takeover target.The theory seems logical. Grubhub's market value is $4.4 billion, much smaller than Uber's $51 billion market cap or the $12.6 billion valuation that DoorDash recently raised money at in May. Theoretically, Grubhub or Postmates, which last raised capital in September at a $2.4 billion valuation, could fairly easily be swallowed by Uber or DoorDash.The problem is that Grubhub, despite its relatively low valuation, would be difficult for DoorDash to acquire because it is public. DoorDash would almost certainly need to use its stock to make an acquisition as large as Grubhub. That would lead to a shareholder vote by Grubhub shareholders to approve the acquisition. That has two problems. First, DoorDash is not public and issuing shares to all of Grubhub shareholders would require it to go public at the same time. Second, Grubhub's shareholders would have little way of valuing DoorDash shares and the market would likely find the $12.6 billion valuation that DoorDash last raised at to be too high, requiring DoorDash to reduce its valuation. As a result, this deal is very unlikely.That leaves Uber. While Uber is public, a potential acquisition by Uber raises other issues. Uber's stock is down over 35% from its highs, and much more from its peak private valuations. That could cause Uber to hesitate to issue its stock to acquire Grubhub. Moreover, Grubhub already operates two brands, Grubhub and Seamless, so any deal would mean Uber Eats would be operating three food delivery brands nationwide. If Uber were to change branding on Grubhub and Seamless to Uber Eats, it would presumably lose significant brand value, particularly with Seamless in New York. Nevertheless, this deal is a possibility.The other side of the coin is that there may be industry consolidation that does not involve Grubhub. This seems more likely in my opinion, particularly a deal between DoorDash and Postmates because both are private companies and would not require new valuations or public company shareholder votes. A combination of DoorDash and Postmates would instantly solidify top market positions in the Southern US markets and West Coast and provide a spring board for launching offensives in Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston. An Uber acquisition of Postmates could also make sense. The deal has a few things going for it: Postmates is likely a willing seller, the deal would be smaller than a Grubhub acquisition, and it wouldn't require a public shareholder vote and would thus be much quicker.Grubhub is losing market share and profitability as large and well-funded competitors Uber, DoorDash (over $2 billion raised to-date) and Postmates (over $900 million raised) reduce industry-wide profitability. Investors were faced with this reality after the third-quarter results, and the stock slumped 43%. Now investors have bid the stock up 48% from its lows on the hope of a take-out by an industry player. While industry consolidation is likely, GRUB's status as a public company and DoorDash's high valuation makes an acquisition by DoorDash very unlikely. The simplest deal would be a combination of DoorDash and Postmates, which would lead to substantial downside in Grubhub's stock. As such, I am short the stock and expect the stock to give back its recent rally if Grubhub is not acquired."
4302204,105372,2019-11-04T12:20:25-05:00,"GrubHub continues to have difficulty maintaining profitability due to the high cost of delivery, which is becoming an increasingly important part of their business.The decline in GrubHub’s growth rate is not surprising given that most attractive cities and consumer segments are likely already near saturation.Competition remains a concern given data that indicates DoorDash continues to take market share.Investors should look to Uber's third-quarter results to gain insight into whether GrubHub's problems are industrywide or company-specific.GrubHub's valuation is now more realistic given the company's prospects, but the share price could decline further if the profitability and growth problems are not resolved.","After GrubHub’s (GRUB) weak Q3 results and negative guidance, the narrative around the company has shifted: Before, it was an undervalued company with bright prospects, and now it is a company with a questionable business model and future. In my previous article (GrubHub: Delivering Underperformance) I covered the problems with GrubHub’s business model and gave a conservative price target for Grubhub of $39 per share, believing the stock could potentially have significantly more downside. Investors should not be fooled into thinking this is an attractive entry point for a quality company' Grubhub still needs to prove they can profitably manage a company based around a delivery network and that it can create sustainable organic growth.GrubHub’s revenue growth has decelerated sharply in recent quarters, with GrubHub’s management citing industry headwinds and not any company-specific issues. Grubhub is referencing third-party data to support this belief even though they have previously said third-party data cannot be trusted. I believe it is likely that deteriorating growth is a result of both GrubHub-specific and industrywide issues, although Uber’s (NYSE:UBER) upcoming earnings should give some insight into whether this is the case. Investors should be concerned if there is an industrywide slowdown as the investment thesis for food-delivery companies has largely been based on the huge addressable market and the potential for economies of scale.Figure 1: GrubHub Estimate of Total Addressable Market(source: GrubHub)(source: GrubHub Shareholder Letter)It appears likely that there is currently a relatively small group of consumers who value the convenience of food delivery enough to pay the high cost, and this is limiting the market size. Delivery platforms must figure out how to reduce delivery costs or their potential for growth and profitability will be limited.There were a number of trends in GrubHub’s past data that signaled a slowdown in growth was likely. In particular, gross revenue per diner has been declining, indicating that new users to the platform have significantly lower value.Figure 2: GrubHub Diner Revenue (source: Created by author using data from GrubHub)A similar dynamic can be seen in GrubHub’s orders-per-user data aggregated by geographic market, where there is a significant difference between New York and other large cities in the United States. As GrubHub expanded their service beyond the largest and most attractive markets, it was inevitable that growth would become more difficult to achieve. In the most recent quarter 40% of GrubHub’s new diners came from their newest markets, 25% came from markets launched in 2012, and the balance came from the oldest markets.Figure 3: GrubHub Orders per Diner Aggregated by Geographic Market(source: GrubHub)In the past GrubHub has relied on acquisitions to generate much of their growth, but with a lack of viable targets remaining they no longer have the ability to do this. Growth must come by taking consumers from competitors or continuing to attract new consumers to the market, both of which are likely to be difficult.Figure 4: GrubHub Estimated Organic Growth(source: Created by author using data from GrubHub)Despite GrubHub’s continued refutation of third-party data, it is clear that they have been rapidly losing market share in the U.S. to Uber Eats and DoorDash (DOORD), and this has likely contributed to their declining revenue growth.Figure 5: U.S. Food Delivery Monthly Sales(source: Second Measure)GrubHub investors should be asking how the company has given up such a dominant position in such a short amount of time and management needs to provide a coherent strategy for stabilizing their market share. GrubHub believes they offer diner the lowest fees and yet they continue to lose market share, which indicates that consumers have a preference for the user experience of other services. Unlike competitors, GrubHub has exclusively placed partnered restaurants on their platform, as they believe it significantly improves the user experience. However, this does not show in user retention data. Most consumers now use more than one food-delivery service which I believe will make price the basis for competition.Figure 6: Consumer Use of Multiple Food Delivery Services in the U.S.(source: Created by author using data from Second Measure)I believe GrubHub’s recent profitability problems are a result of competition being largely based on price and loss-making delivery services making up a larger proportion of total revenue. Since 2015 as the delivery network has grown relative to the marketplace, GrubHub’s profitability has declined.Figure 7: GrubHub Expenses as a % of Revenue(source: Created by author using data from GrubHub)GrubHub can be viewed as a marketplace for ordering food and a food-delivery network. The marketplace for ordering food is highly profitable and the food-delivery network loses money. Adding delivery services allowed GrubHub to expand their addressable market as well as generate more revenue per order, but at much lower margins.Figure 8: Example of GrubHub Fees(source: GrubHub)(source: GrubHub Shareholder Letter)Even though delivery is destroying the economics of GrubHub’s business it is not a service they can afford to abandon. It drives a significant amount of volume and allows a much large range of restaurants to be offered on the platform.Figure 9: GrubHub Order Volume Growth After the Introduction of Delivery(source: GrubHub)I believe success in the food-delivery space is dependent on the efficiency of the company’s logistics network. GrubHub believes that delivery is a commodity service that does not improve with scale and did not even mention strategies to improve delivery on the Q3 earnings call. GrubHub now delivers approximately 35% of daily active grubs and I believe this number will only grow over time, increasing the importance of delivery.(source: GrubHub Shareholder Letter)It is concerning that GrubHub believes there is no viable strategy for improving their delivery operations. Other companies have raised the possibility of economies of density, drones, artificial intelligence and ghost kitchens as means to reduce the cost of delivery. It is not clear to what extent these strategies could work but it would be reassuring for GrubHub to address their growing operations and support costs and present a long term vision for reducing them.The strategy GrubHub presented to turnaround their business consists primarily of increasing restaurant inventory and increasing diner loyalty. GrubHub has had 15 years to build consumer loyalty, so it is not clear what they can change now or why they haven’t implemented those ideas in the past. GrubHub has a diner-focused strategy: They believe the winning service has to offer diners a differentiated service. I believe they offer a commodity service, leading consumers to use the lowest-cost service, and given this I do not understand the focus on diners.GrubHub currently has over 140,000 restaurants on the platform already and plans to add non-partnered restaurants to the platform in an aim to double inventory in 2020.(source: GrubHub Shareholder Letter)While I believe adding restaurants to the platform will help to generate additional revenue, there appears to be diminishing returns to adding more restaurants at this point. Growth in restaurants on the platform is already outpacing growth in diners on the platform and gross orders per restaurant are declining.Figure 10: GrubHub Restaurants and Monthly Active Diners(source: Created by author using data from GrubHub)Figure 11: GrubHub Gross Orders per Restaurant(source: Created by author using data from GrubHub)Significant space in GrubHub’s letter to investors was dedicated to discussing the value GrubHub provides to restaurants and how they can drive incremental traffic, but this is essentially the same value proposition as every other food delivery platform. With so many restaurants on the platform there is likely to be little benefit to the average restaurant joining and yet they cannot afford not to, as they risk losing business to competitors.Figure 12: Example of GrubHub’s Impact on a Restaurant(source: Created by author)In addition to its other problems GrubHub is facing the specter of regulation in its largest market, New York. The state liquor authority is considering a policy that would cap the fees food-delivery services can charge restaurants with a liquor license at 10%. This is due to a state policy that requires any entity that shares in a restaurant’s profits to be listed on its liquor license, with exceptions for vendors taking less than 10%. To continue charging higher fees, GrubHub would need to join thousands of individual liquor licenses statewide. Regardless of the outcome in this particular situation, it is reflective of general concern in the restaurant industry that food-delivery services are taking an inequitable share of their revenue and to the extent that food-delivery sales are not incremental, this is reducing their profits. As food-delivery services continue to grow this issue is only like to become more prominent, particularly as food-delivery sales are less likely to be incremental.Figure 13: Food Delivery Market Share by City September 2019(source: Second Measure)GrubHub’s current situation reminds me of Nokia (NOK) when the iPhone was introduced. Nokia was the market leader at the time with solid profitability and high growth rates. When the iPhone was introduced the basis for competition shifted and Nokia was left with an uncompetitive product. They were unable to adapt and their business did not recover. GrubHub’s online food marketplace has historically been the market leader in the U.S. but as the basis of competition has shifted to delivery they have been left with an inferior service to companies like DoorDash that are focused on delivery. If GrubHub is unable to adapt, they could suffer the same fate as Nokia.Figure 14: Nokia and GrubHub Share Prices(source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)At this point I do not think this is an existential crisis for GrubHub, provided they can stem market share losses and cap delivery expenses. There are aspects of GrubHub’s business to like:GrubHub’s management team has admitted there is a problem with the business, which is a positive, but their current strategy does not inspire confidence. I believe GrubHub’s share price is now more closely aligned with the prospects of the company, but there is still potential for further downside if they cannot find a way to improve growth and profitability. GrubHub needs to be valued as the low-margin, low-growth business they now are, and based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate their intrinsic value to be approximately $29 per share."

Expect the shares to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future.","Admittedly, the writing had been on the wall already for some time now as leading online and mobile food ordering and delivery marketplace Grubhub (GRUB) has been struggling to meet market participants' expectations over the past couple of quarters.Source: Taco BellAs a result, the company's stock has suffered a host of analyst price target reductions or outright downgrades in recent months. Adding insult to injury, renowned shortseller Jim Chanos disclosed a short position in the company's shares last month, highlighting, among other things, limited growth opportunities, labor cost pressures and severe competition from the likes of Uber Eats (UBER):Suffice to say, Monday's Q3/2019 shareholder letter has proven Chanos right all along as the company failed to deliver on its all-important ""Daily Average Grubs"" (""DAG"") metric which not only grew just 10% year-over-year but was actually down 6% sequentially:The shareholder letter goes on by openly stating the obvious (emphasis added by author):In addition, the company admitted to its customers ""becoming more promiscuous"":As a result of the changing industry dynamics, Grubhub is required to make substantial changes to its business model:In sum, the new initiatives will require aggressive investment which is reflected in the company's Q4/2019 and preliminary 2020 guidance (emphasis added by author):The sheer magnitude of the impact on the company's financials is eye-catching. Prior to Monday's shareholder letter, analysts on average expected Q4 revenues of $387.3 million but at the middle of the guided range, the company now expects to fall short of that number by more than $60 million.Same for Grubhub's full year adjusted EBITDA expectations which are now expected to come in more than 25% lower than the originally projected $235-250 million range.Moreover, the company's revenues have remained at roughly the same level for each quarter in 2019 so far and Q4 will be no different.With analysts previously looking for more than 25% year-over-year revenue growth and an almost 60% increase in earnings per share in FY2020, the revised projections are nothing short of a disaster.With Grubhub essentially guiding for an up to 45% decline in adjusted EBITDA next year and much lower than anticipated growth, analysts will have to rework their models.As a result, investors need to prepare for a host of downgrades and price target reductions on Tuesday.While some analysts already pointed to the requirement of resetting expectations prior to the earnings release, the sheer magnitude of the revision is simply stunning.Given ongoing, unfavorable industry dynamics and Grubhub's mediocre balance sheet, management would be well served to consider putting the company up for sale rather sooner than later.Jim Chanos will likely have a well-deserved field day on Tuesday but I don't really expect him to start covering his short position that soon as his thesis has seemingly just started to play out.Expect Grubhub's shares to remain under pressure for the time being as the company's new growth initiatives will take time to play out and investors increasingly start scrutinizing the business model."
4299947,103480,2019-10-29T12:56:07-04:00,"Shares of GrubHub had their worst day all year, tanking more than 30% after reporting dismal Q3 results.The company reported slowing revenue and daily active grub (DAG) growth, a lingering concern from last quarter.In addition, the company forecast its slowest-ever growth rate in Q4, leading many to believe that GrubHub is headed toward secular deceleration.However, the reality is likely far better than it seems. While GrubHub faces many challenges, the fact that its stock price is trading at half the value it which it began the year makes it attractive.Expect new partnerships with national chains like Wendy's and McDonalds to contribute to diner expansion in future quarters.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Let's face it: GrubHub (GRUB) is no longer growing as quickly and as seamlessly as it used to in the past. The country's biggest food delivery service, beset by rampant competition from fast-growing startups like Uber Eats and DoorDash, and catering to a fickle customer base who have little loyalty to one provider versus another, is experiencing some serious growing pains. Both revenue growth and the count of active diners, which GrubHub affectionally calls ""daily active grubs "" (DAGs), have seen a frightening pace of deceleration over the past several quarters, and the company's latest guidance outlook for the current fourth quarter doesn't hint that the pain is soon to subside.Worried over the company's most recent quarterly update, investors sent shares of GrubHub reeling: the stock crashed more than 30% in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings announcement, marking one of the worst one-day declines in the internet sector this year (beating even Twitter's (TWTR) ~20% collapse last week).Data by YChartsWhile acknowledging that GrubHub's issues are certainly larger than they seemed at the beginning of the year, I continue to find tremendous value in GrubHub shares. The company's performance must be looked at in conjunction with its plummeting share price. GrubHub is currently trading at roughly half the value at which it began 2019, and less than one-third of the value at which it notched an all-time high one year ago in September 2018. The stock is trading at a mere 4x forward revenues, as shown in the chart above - whereas last year, GrubHub was easily trading at a double-digit revenue multiple.Past valuation, of course, is no justification for a company's current worth: but we do have to ask ourselves if GrubHub's business has deteriorated enough to where the company is worth a fraction of what it was last year. I view GrubHub's current problems as no different than any company that has reached a substantial scale. After all, GrubHub is pulling in revenues at north of a >$1 billion annual run rate - certainly any business that has become this large is sure to attract competition and scale-driven growth fatigue.I also continue to be encouraged by the big-ticket partnerships that GrubHub is capable of drawing in. Longtime followers of GrubHub will note that a large portion of GrubHub's growth last year, and a big driver of the increase in its share price, has been the national expansion of its partnership with Yum Brands (YUM), the franchisor behind fast-food titans such as KFC and Taco Bell. GrubHub's reach has expanded this year to include McDonalds (an announcement that produced a short-lived pop in GrubHub's share price last month) and, most recently, Wendys (WEN), which previously was locked into an exclusive argument with competitor DoorDash. Other recent adds or expansions include Applebee's, Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), IHOP, Panera Bread, and Shake Shack, and Subway - needless to say, all national titans with hundreds or even thousands of locations each, greatly expanding GrubHub's reach.These national chain deals are key to sustaining GrubHub's growth, and despite the current slippage in DAG growth rates, we can hope for a recovery in growth once these new partnerships have time to sink in. Variety of doing options, and maintaining greater diversity than its peers, is the best way for GrubHub to continue its growth trajectory - by adding both nationally-recognized franchises as well as smaller, local favorites; and GrubHub has continued being aggressive in expanding its restaurant list.Over time, online food delivery will only experience secular growth - so despite heightened competition, there's plenty of pie for all the major competitors to share. I remain encouraged by the fact that despite a >$1 billion annual revenue run rate, GrubHub continues to grow at a >30% y/y pace (we'll see if the deceleration GrubHub has baked into its fourth-quarter forecast will really become reality), and in the meantime, I continue to believe a ~4x forward revenue multiple is an attractive entry point for a ~30% grower in a huge, trending industry that also happens to be profitable on an EBITDA, cash flow, and GAAP EPS basis - something that rival Uber (UBER) can't claim.There's no doubt that GrubHub's latest results stir some disappointment. Here's a look at the company's Q3 metrics:Figure 1. GrubHub key metricsSource: GrubHub Q3 earnings releaseActive diner growth slowed to 39% y/y to 21.2 million. Though we note that GrubHub still notched a record number of active diners on a nominal basis, active diner growth decelerated one point relative to 30% y/y growth last quarter.Perhaps more concerning was the slowdown in daily average grubs to 457k, representing just 10% y/y growth - and far below last quarter's 16% y/y growth rate, which in turn was three points Lower than the Q1 DAG growth rate and far below Wall Street's expectations at the time. The fact that active diners are still growing at a ~30% clip while daily active grubs are creeping toward single-digit growth is an indicator that GrubHub's customer base is becoming more fickle.The company acknowledged as much in its third-quarter shareholder letter. The company's commentary in that letter on diner behavior offers some useful context (key points highlighted):In other words, customers have less motivation now to stick with GrubHub versus going with a competitor - it really depends on which provider has the restaurant that the diner wants, and which one is offering a more attractive price. But while technology investors tend to shy away from competition, as I said at the outset, this is a natural course of events for any large business. GrubHub reiterated that its estimate of the annual market for takeout in the U.S. (including both pickup and delivery) is $200 billion. Put together GrubHub and all of its competitors, and it still hasn't dented a fraction of this market.Another encouraging signal: GrubHub's latest and biggest partnerships, especially with the likes of McDonald's, haven't fully rolled out yet. When these partnerships reach maturity, GrubHub still has the ability to tap into a new set of customers that it may not have had access to before.The second piece of worrying data coming out of the Q3 release was GrubHub's fourth-quarter guidance update. Already in Q3, GrubHub's revenue of $322.1 million (+30% y/y) missed Wall Street's expectations of $329.5 million (+33% y/y) missed Wall Street's mark by three points, and decelerated from last quarter's 36% y/y growth rate by a stark six-point gap. To add insult to injury, GrubHub is forecasting further deceleration in the fourth quarter:Figure 2. GrubHub guidance updateSource: GrubHub Q3 earnings releaseThe midpoint of GrubHub's revenue guidance, at $325 million, represents just 13% y/y growth relative to $287.7 million in revenue generated in 4Q18. This would mark GrubHub's slowest-ever quarter of growth and its worst quarter of deceleration. Given that we're already a month into the fourth quarter, we assume that GrubHub has already seen some of the actual results slow down in the month of October, prompting this guidance cut.What will happen, however, when GrubHub's latest partnerships hit the market? I still expect a few points of upside to come from there. In addition, the other reason that GrubHub's guidance disappointed - its low EBITDA forecast of $15-$25 million, versus expectations of $79 million - is due to the fact that GrubHub intends to invest aggressively in its growth. The company explained its decision as follows:In other words, GrubHub will spend viciously to enter new markets and to advertise aggressively to win market share. Yes, profitability will suffer in the short term - but the company needs to stop the bleeding in DAG counts first. As a long-term shareholder, I support management's forward thinking.And despite this vigorous investment in marketing, GrubHub still notes that it expects to deliver ""at least $100 million"" in adjusted EBITDA in FY20. At present share prices around $33, GrubHub trades at a market cap of $3.05 billion and an enterprise value of $3.12 billion, implying that the company is trading at quite a modest ~31x forward EBITDA based on a cyclically low forward EBITDA projection that has plenty of room for expansion once GrubHub's core business stabilizes.After all, the company did write that it was confident in its ability to produce $2 in EBITDA per order in 2020. If we extrapolate out GrubHub's current DAGs of 457k and multiply by 365 days, we arrive at a ""potential"" annualized EBITDA of $333.6 million, not even counting any future DAG growth. I'd rather value GrubHub based on this potential, not on a down year for profitability in which GrubHub is deciding to invest heavily into growth.While fully acknowledging that GrubHub's growth path is fraught with competitive concerns, we also like the fact that the company is playing in a tremendously large market with plenty of room for growth for all players. While I'd have liked to see higher growth rates and a quicker stabilization in DAG growth rates, I'm happy to stick with GrubHub at its current rock-bottom share price and wait on the longer-term recovery."
4293744,105372,2019-09-26T13:51:47-04:00,"Grubhub has historically been dominant in online food ordering and delivery in the U.S. but is rapidly losing market share to competitors.
        Grubhub’s profitability is declining as a result of the higher costs associated with operating their own delivery network and this trend is likely to continue.
        Grubhub continues to view itself predominantly as a marketplace for food which I believe is an inferior strategy to competitors who are focused on operating efficient delivery networks.","Grubhub (GRUB) was founded as a marketplace for connecting diners and restaurants, although this has been a profitable business model, the basis for competition has shifted to delivery which is eroding Grubhub’s profitability and putting them at a disadvantage to companies like Uber Eats (UBER) and DoorDash. Food delivery continues to be a fast-growing market but Grubhub’s market share and profitability will continue to decline, limiting any upside for the stock.Food delivery presents a huge opportunity with global spending on consumer food services of approximately $2.8 trillion in 2017. Uber estimates that the current total addressable food delivery market is $795 billion, which is the amount that consumers spent on meals from home delivery, takeaway, and drive-through worldwide in 2017. Online market penetration for food delivery is low relative to other markets but is expected to grow rapidly in coming years with an 18% annual growth rate expected over the next 3 years.Figure 1: Online Market Penetration(source: Morgan Stanley)While current growth rates for food delivery services are impressive it should be kept in mind that most services are operating at a significant loss, meaning delivery prices are suppressed below sustainable levels. Investors are essentially subsidizing delivery costs for consumers, and it is not clear how demand would be affected by higher delivery costs.Figure 2: Food Delivery Market Projected Growth(source: Morgan Stanley)The food delivery market opportunity has been created by a shift in consumer preferences towards convenience over price and technology simplifying the ordering and delivery process. The high cost of delivery relative to the cost of food remains the primary barrier for most consumers though, making the efficiency of a food delivery companies delivery network the main basis for competition.Figure 3: Reasons for Not Ordering Food Delivery(source: Morgan Stanley)Despite the success of food delivery companies like Grubhub and Door Dash, consumers continue to primarily order food directly from restaurants by phone or through the restaurant’s website. This is changing though, with delivery platforms gaining market share as a result of increased convenience and a wider range.Figure 4: Food Delivery Channel Market Share(source: Morgan Stanley)While the opportunity is large, the economics of the food delivery business model are marginal as a result of delivery costs being significant relative to the cost of food. Delivery platforms are hoping that profitability will be achievable through scale as delivery costs could potentially decline significantly from economies of density. Other pathways to profitability include operating ghost kitchens, expanding into the delivery of other goods and reducing costs through the automation of delivery. Delivery platforms may also be able to increase consumer willingness to pay by improving their service offering.RestaurantsRestaurants like Starbucks can make significant demands in terms of the amount of marketing the platform provides, low commissions on orders, data sharing requirements and low delivery fees for their customers. This will make it difficult for food delivery platforms to earn profits from these types of relationships which is likely to be a highly negative outcome as restaurants like Starbucks may account for a significant percentage of delivery volume.The long tail of restaurants will be squeezed by food delivery platforms as they have no leverage and are reliant on delivery platforms helping users to discover their restaurants. For many restaurants food delivery is unlikely to even be beneficial as research shows that a significant portion of meal deliveries are replacements for dining in, indicating that meal delivery is cannibalizing demand. Despite this joining a delivery platform is likely a better alternative than not joining a platform and losing customers to competitors.DriversGig economy platforms like ride sharing and food delivery are coming under increased pressure from their labor supply due to regulation and in some cases unionization. While delivery driving offers benefits like flexibility, delivery platforms will have to ensure driver compensation is fair relative to full-time employees which may exert cost pressure going forward.ConsumersConsumers are focused on the range of restaurants available and the cost and speed of delivery and have shown no loyalty to delivery platforms, with most platforms having low retention rates making marketing a poor use of capital. Trust and safety are less of a concern in food delivery than in similar businesses like ride sharing or property rentals which weakens the value proposition of the platform making user retention more difficult. In my opinion food delivery platforms should be focused on offering restaurants a service which is simple and adds value to their operations while creating an efficient logistics system instead of trying to enhance the consumer experience or attracting users through marketing.Figure 5: Food Delivery Platform Customer Retention(source: Second Measure)Grubhub was founded in 2004 as a platform for connecting diners and restaurants and is one of the leading online food delivery companies in the U.S. with 20.3 million monthly active users and 125,000 restaurants on its platform in over 2,400 U.S. cities and London. Grubhub was one of the first movers in the online food delivery space, helping to establish the market and for many years it merely acted as a marketplace to connect restaurants and diners with restaurants having to provide their own delivery services.As the result of the development of the gig economy Grubhub launched deliveries in June 2014 which has resulted in more widespread adoption of the service and contributed to its high growth rate. Grubhub continues to achieve strong growth in both monthly active diners and restaurants on the platform, which are both positive trends. This growth has accelerated in recent years, likely as a result of Grubhub expanding delivery services.Figure 6: Grubhub Diners and Restaurants(source: Created by author using data from Grubhub)Grubhub’s growth strategy consists of:In recent years Grubhub has grown predominantly through a series of food delivery and ordering acquisitions and the Grubhub portfolio of brands now includes Grubhub, Seamless, LevelUp, Tapingo, AllMenus and MenuPages. It appears these acquisitions were to acquire platform users more so than to acquire technology or extend the product portfolio.Figure 7: Platform User Growth(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Grubhub’s focus on growing users through marketing and through acquisitions is a poor strategy as user retention rates are low meaning the return on these investments is also likely to be low. The lack of focus on improving their delivery network and improving their service offering for restaurants should also be a concern for investors.While growth in diners is positive, there is large variability in the value of diners as some will use the service daily, while other diners may only use the service on rare occasions. Diners who are likely to use the service the most are also likely to be early adopters and so new diners should be expected to contribute less revenue. This is a concerning trend for Grubhub which makes revenue growth difficult to achieve and is occurring despite Grubhub adding more restaurant options.Figure 8: Grubhub Gross Bookings per Diner(source: Created by author using data from Grubhub)Grubhub has so far managed to avoid the impact of declining gross revenue per diner by increasing its take rate from restaurants, which is mainly the result of higher fees from using Grubhub’s delivery service instead of restaurants using their own delivery service.Figure 9: Grubhub Take Rate and Revenue per Diner(source: Created by author using data from Grubhub)Although expanded delivery services are driving growth, they are also driving a disproportionate increase in expenses and eroding Grubhub’s profit margins. Restaurants that use the Grubhub delivery services pay an additional commission on the transaction for the use of those services and from this revenue Grubhub must cover the costs of delivery. Delivery costs are destroying the economics of Grubhub’s business model as consumers appear willing to pay less for delivery than it costs to provide those services.Sales and marketing expenses have also begun to increase relative to revenue, likely due to increased competition and higher acquisition costs for new customers who are less inclined to use food delivery services.Figure 10: Grubhub Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Grubhub)Grubhub’s declining profitability is particularly concerning as margins should be expanding as it scales due to operating leverage and economies of scale. Even when Grubhub’s revenues were low it was a highly profitable business indicating the core food ordering platform is extremely profitable. As delivery services become an increasingly important part of the platform Grubhub’s profit margins are likely to continue to decline unless they can significantly improve their delivery network.Figure 11: Ridesharing and Food Delivery Platform Profitability(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 12: Ridesharing and Food Delivery Platform Profitability(source: Created by author using data from company reports)The large potential of the food delivery market has drawn a number of competitors led by Uber Eats and DoorDash, most of whom are losing a significant amount of money. Unlike Grubhub these companies are focused on creating efficient delivery networks, which I believe gives them a strategic advantage that Grubhub has failed to appreciate.(source: Grubhub 2018 Annual Report)Uber established Uber Eats 3 years ago and believe they now have the largest food delivery company in the world outside of China, based on gross bookings. Uber Eats had 15 million monthly active platform consumers’ in the quarter ending December 2018, which is approaching Grubhub’s 20 million active diners and is impressive given the age of the service. Uber Eats is extremely important to the future of Uber as it is the second largest segment and the fastest growing making it likely the service will receive significant focus from Uber. While Uber can potentially leverage their ride sharing network for food delivery, the benefits are not clear as food delivery is better suited to motorbikes and bicycles. Uber’s biggest advantages in this market are likely its brand name and large ride sharing user base.DoorDash was founded in 2013 with the goal of being the last-mile logistics layer that empowers businesses to thrive in the digital and convenience economy. Since its launch DoorDash has achieved rapid growth, gaining significant market share from Grubhub and now has a presence in over 1,200 cities in the U.S. and Canada and has over 100,000 restaurants on their platform. Data indicates that DoorDash may have recently become the market share leader in food delivery in the U.S., but this is disputed by Grubhub who claim DoorDash’s narrative has “been aided by some grossly incorrect third-party credit-card panels”.DoorDash is focused on creating an efficient delivery network and helping restaurants increase their revenue, which I believe is a more sustainable approach than focusing on customer acquisition through marketing. DoorDash offers a suite of products to their restaurant partners which ensure faster and more accurate deliveries along with a support system that solves customer problems in real-time. DoorDash also offers DoorDash Drive, a platform that helps merchants run their own private label delivery service, tapping DoorDash’s expertise and fleet of more than 200,000 Dashers across the U.S. and Canada.Other DoorDash innovations include a subscription service which offers unlimited access to hundreds of restaurants with free delivery, grocery delivery launched in partnership with Walmart and a pilot automated food delivery service using robots. DoorDash is backed by $2 billion in funding and in its most recent funding round was valued at $12.6 billion, although recent IPO’s may indicate that venture capital markets have become overvalued.Figure 13: Online Food Delivery Market Share 2017-2019(source: quartz)Given the embryonic state of the food delivery market and its large potential, it is likely to evolve significantly in coming years. Given the similarities between food and grocery delivery I believe it is likely there will be integration between these two markets at some point. In particular online grocers who operate their own delivery network are a natural fit for operating ghost kitchens, which have the potential to significantly improve the economics of food delivery by lowering the cost of meal creation and converting the delivery problem from many-to-many to one-to-many. Grubhub, Deliveroo, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates are all experimenting with ghost kitchens to some extent with the most common approach being to provide restaurants with the resources to operate a ghost kitchen.While ghost kitchens are likely to offer an improvement in economics, I believe food delivery is unlikely to be an attractive business until delivery costs are reduced through automation. Drones could potentially significantly reduce costs for food delivery companies, but this may not necessarily translate to higher profitability. If all food delivery platforms have access to the same automated food delivery technology, then the benefits may accrue to consumers through lower prices and not to the platform. Grubhub appears to be lagging competitors in expanding the delivery network into adjacent markets like grocery delivery, developing ghost kitchens and introducing delivery drones. DoorDash and UberEats are likely to be more successful in these areas due to more technology competency and access to more capital.Based on a discounted cash flow model I estimate that Grubhub’s intrinsic value is approximately $39 per share. I believe markets are yet to fully realize how quickly DoorDash is overtaking Grubhub as the leading platform and how delivery costs are destroying the economics of Grubhub’s business model. Grubhub’s self-image as a marketplace for restaurants and diners will continue to drive underperformance as the basis for competition continues to move toward efficient delivery."

The talk around Grubhub tends to revolve around heightened competition from the likes of Uber (UBER) and DoorDash (DOORD) (investors seem to constantly forget Amazon Restaurants' (NASDAQ:AMZN) exit earlier this year), as well as price competition leading to lower margins. Grubhub's Q2 earnings release - which beat on revenues, while missing on earnings per share and daily active grubs - fed into the frenzy, causing shares to drop more than 12%. Year to date, Grubhub has shed about 7% of its market value, desperately trailing the S&P 500's 19% gains.Data by YChartsYet, despite the doom-and-gloom, I continue to believe that massive selloffs such as this one give investors a chance to increase their exposure in a company that has not yet had the opportunity to rebound. Despite the appearance of intensifying competition, Grubhub's underlying business remains sound. Growth rates continue on a stable trajectory, certainly slowing along a normal path of a company reaching greater scale - but not exactly jolted by the continued growth of Uber Eats or the recent billion-dollar financings by rivals DoorDash and Postmates (POSTM) as they gear up for their own IPOs. In addition, this week's M&A news from across the pond, highlighting Dutch company Takeaway.com's $10 billion merger with British rival Just Eat, indicates that these food-delivery businesses have plenty of global value and traction. And according to a William Blair report cited by the Wall Street Journal, 10% of restaurant sales will be executed on a food delivery platform by 2022 - so companies like Grubhub are well-positioned to capitalize on this consumption shift.Grubhub's continued revenue strength seems to suggest that there's plenty of room in the food delivery business for several incumbents - it's a Pepsi (PEP) and Coke (KO) situation that doesn't necessarily favor a single company to reign supreme. In a further signal of revenue confidence, Grubhub also tightened its full-year revenue outlook to $1.34-$1.39 billion, representing 33-38% y/y growth - a narrower range that's unchanged at the midpoint relative to a prior view of $1.315-$1.415 billion.Figure 1. Grubhub guidance updateSource: Grubhub 2Q19 earnings releaseLast month, Grubhub also announced that the company's new partnership with Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) went live in New York City across 400 stores. Needless to say, Dunkin' is a major national brand that has the potential to become another anchor Grubhub partner similar to YUM! Brands (YUM) - so there's plenty of upside momentum as we enter into the back half of FY19.In short, Grubhub remains an underestimated company that is currently trading at a historically low valuation of just 5.4x EV/forward estimated revenues, as shown in its price chart below - in the past, Grubhub's valuation multiples have stretched into the double digits. For a company that is still growing revenues in the mid-30% range, it's fair to make an argument that Grubhub has entered value territory.Stay long here and buy the dip.Let's dive into the results of Grubhub's second quarter in greater detail:Figure 2. Grubhub 2Q19 resultsSource: Grubhub 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 36% y/y to $325.1 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $318.4 million (+33% y/y) by a comfortable three-point margin. Note also that revenues decelerated three points from last quarter's 39% y/y growth rate - but given that first-half revenues grew at a combined 37% y/y and that Grubhub's updated FY19 guidance range calls for 33-38% y/y growth, we still have plenty of confidence in Grubhub hitting the higher end of its estimates for the year.Here's a look at how the underlying business trends performed:Figure 3. Grubhub 2Q19 resultsSource: Grubhub 2Q19 earnings releaseThe single metric that investors latched on to - and perhaps the single biggest driver behind the stock's double-digit post-earnings decline - is the growth rate in Daily Average Grubs (DAGs), which grew 16% y/y to 488.9k. Wall Street, on the other hand, had expected one point of stronger growth at 494.8k DAGs, and Q1 DAG growth had clocked in at 19% y/y - a full three points stronger than this quarter's growth rate. DAGs also declined -6% relative to Q1's DAGs of 521k, though Grubhub noted that the company has historically seen a ""low to mid-single digits"" decline from Q1 to Q2 due to regular summer seasonality.Matt Maloney, Grubhub's CEO, had a ready explanation for the slowdown in DAG growth during his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:There are counterbalancing points here, however. Active diners continued to climb to record highs at 20.3 million, a sequential add of about 1 million net new active diners (+5%) since Q1, and up an astonishing 30% y/y. The strength in active diner additions illustrates how powerful new partnership like Dunkin' Brands (which rolled out in the last few weeks of the quarter) can be in expanding Grubhub's total addressable market. We note as well that gross food sales, the measure of all restaurant orders transacted on the platform, rose 20% y/y to $1.46 billion - which is a hair stronger than Wall Street's estimates of $1.45 billion. So sure, while DAGs might have missed, a stronger average price per ""Grub"" ultimately made gross food sales glide past analyst expectations.It's worth noting as well that Maloney has also become more aggressive about addressing Grubhub's competition. In a recent interview with Forbes, he took a swipe at Uber Eats' service fees that are tacked on top of delivery fees, which he described as ""price gouging."" Maloney has consistently stressed that Grubhub's pricing model is more transparent to consumers than its competitors' - and if this truism becomes more broadly known, Grubhub could pick up market share.On the restaurant side of the equation, Grubhub is also chasing growth by going after independent restaurants - not just flashy national partnerships like Dunkin' Brands. The company cited ""hundreds of net new independent restaurants"" in New York City, while also citing low restaurant churn across its platform.One additional point that we like in the quarter is that Grubhub noted a boost in adjusted EBITDA per order - hitting $1.23 this quarter, and up sequentially fourteen cents relative to $1.09 in Q1. This metric proves to us that as Grubhub continues to scale, its operating costs tend to decline as a percentage of revenues - so even though operating income declined this quarter and pro forma EPS missed consensus ($0.27 versus Wall Street's mark of $0.24), the long-term trend supports improved profitability for Grubhub.Commenting on Grubhub's increased per-order profitability, CFO Adam DeWitt noted as follows on the Q2 earnings call:We note as well that Grubhub has a fairly flexible balance sheet with $377 million in cash and positive free cash flow through the first half of the year - giving it the flexibility to continue investing in growth or pursue acquisitions.In my view, this quarter's near-term DAG miss has little bearing on Grubhub's overall long-term bullish thesis, which is built on the following key points:Take advantage of the slashed share prices to build a position in Grubhub."

Now, it is feeling the heat from third-party delivery companies, leading to slowing sales.At the same time, Domino’s are also “growing units too fast,” Penney said, which will anger franchisees as their profit margins decline.These issues will manifest in a lower stock price, with Penney thinking that it will decline first to $180 and then perhaps go as low as $150.Source: BloombergPenney told Real Vision’s Jake Merl that the only third-party delivery company investors should look at today is GrubHub. “GrubHub is definitely profitable, with [around] $220 million in EBITDA,” he said. “The company could easily double.”Source: BloombergPenney likes the pairs trade for investors here. Specifically, he likes shorting Domino’s (DPZ) at current levels, and thinks share prices could reach as low as $180 over the next 6 months.In addition, he likes buying GrubHub (GRUB) at current levels, and thinks the stock price could double over the next 6 months."
4279416,104183,2019-07-31T08:16:10-04:00,Recent speculation has begun to build over whether or not GrubHub will be acquired in the face of rising competition.The most likely suitor is Amazon who’s just experienced recent failure in Amazon Restaurants.A potential takeout of GrubHub could value the company at least 30% higher.,"How likely is a takeover of GrubHub (GRUB)? Analyst reports this week have started to really hammer the M&A theme in the industry with the theme that scale will win out. There are several moving parts to the food delivery industry at the moment, with large corporates either teaming up via M&A or large investments being made into startups across the globe. Meanwhile, GrubHub has yet to do anything substantive for its base since the acquisition of Eat24, which ended quite poorly. Now, as M&A speculation heats up, it’s possible that with the stock down nearly 50% in the last twelve months that a buyer could emerge in the coming months.Source: GrubHubThis week, we’ve seen the announcement of the acquisition of Just Eat by Takeaway.com, in an $11 billion deal (£9 billion). This is one of the largest deals in Europe this year and it sent Just Eat shares ripping +22% into the London close. It’s an all-stock agreement and there’s further speculation that another bidder could emerge, which would naturally drive the price up higher. The two names in contention are Germany-based Delivery Hero (DHERO) and South Africa-based Naspers (NPSND).As a result, the rumor mill is producing Amazon (AMZN) as a top potential acquirer for GrubHub. In looking at the company’s current platform delivery, there’s the recent $575 million investment into the UK’s Deliveroo, a clear market leader. However, that’s been paused by the UK CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) as Amazon becomes a bit too commonplace for the regulator to feel comfortable blindly signing off on the next venture.Going back, we can look at the buyout of Whole Foods back in 2017 as a core driver of the food delivery expansion. Whole Foods’ delivery platform at the moment offers AmazonFresh, which for an additional fee, allows users to order delivery from the various Whole Foods locations, as well as numerous other grocery stores.Amazon itself has even learned the hard way that scale wins out in this industry. Amazon Restaurants recently failed, which is a rarity from the company that has been so successful across so many different ventures thus far. That’s why I find the below data really compelling. Amazon simply had no scale in the business and with the massive capital expenditure that it requires to start a business like this in such a competitive industry already, it wasn’t a given that it would be successful.If anything, the cards were stacked against them. Below is a table that shows the number of restaurants each platform delivers for. While these likely correlate to revenue, it’s not a constant ratio, as it’s a multi-variable project to try and derive revenue from restaurant count; however, they are a good proxy for which platforms may be good merger candidates and what platforms a potential acquirer would want to go after.Investors should note that GrubHub has one of the top positions in the U.S., as they’re second only to DoorDash. That kind of scale is compelling for a potential acquirer, especially as its own venture was unsuccessful but needs the platform in order to effectively scale in key markets like the U.S., the United Kingdom, and India.Source: ThinknumThere are now reports that Amazon wants to push into India with respect to food delivery. GrubHub, with a fantastic platform that has been able to handle growth at scale quite well, would help the company compete in markets like India, especially as it is populated with numerous startups that are struggling to become profitable. I’ll caution investors, here, as the rumor mill starts to really expand and Reuters is reporting that a newspaper based out of India stated Amazon will buy Uber Eats. That is currently unverified, but does show investors how quickly M&A speculation builds.Another potential buyer of GrubHub is Uber (UBER). If I were to assign a probability between the two - Amazon and Uber - as to who would buy GrubHub, I’d overwhelmingly lean towards Amazon simply because of the financial resources of the company. Uber doesn’t have the strongest financials and certainly doesn’t have the firepower to support a ~$10 billion takeover. While they have $6.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet, they also have $6.8 billion in long-term debt against negative adjusted EBITDA on a full year basis. Thus, they’d be levered through the gills if they were to try and buy GrubHub. While I want to rule Uber out, it’s speculation like that of Uber & Postmates doing a tie-up, which would naturally come with a multibillion-dollar price tag considering the 10% domestic market share for food delivery.The fact of the matter is that GrubHub’s returns have lagged the market significantly on a YTD, just having broken positive for the year following Monday’s session, now +1.4%. The stock has nearly halved since mid-2018 and that kind of drawdown adds significant risk for investors, especially with so many institutional investors actively betting against the stock.Source: BloombergI will note that this stock is an interesting takeover candidate in that it has a 20% short base. Further speculation will fuel short-covering as this is not the type of stock you want to be short if a deal starts to look more probable than not.Source: BloombergBy any sort of traditional measure, the valuation of GrubHub lends itself to be rather expensive. It’s not the least bit attractive at 127x earnings, but then again, in this space, there aren’t many profitable companies so perhaps there’s scope for a potential acquirer to walk in, make difficult operating decisions, lean out the business, and bulk up the bottom line. Still, this is going to be regarded as expensive depending on who the acquirer is. If it’s Amazon, I’m hard-pressed to believe that investors would be upset with the end price, even if it's a 40-50% premium over the trailing 90-day VWAP. That would be just shy of a $10 billion purchase price, before the $139 million net debt consideration.Value, of course, is relative and it’s difficult to say what fair value for GrubHub might be in an M&A scenario. There are no companies like GrubHub currently public in U.S. equity markets that have any sort of similar capitalization, making trading multiples quite difficult to evaluate. We can make the argument that Uber Eats is public, through Uber, but that business is still predominantly ride-sharing, for which GrubHub isn’t comparable to. Thus, we really do need to take the 127x earnings multiple with a grain of salt. Elsewhere, I’ll say that the company has a run rate adj. EBITDA of ~$204 million and LTM adj. EBITDA of $220 million, placing the EV/Adj. EBITDA at 30x on an LTM basis and 33x on a forward basis. Rather, I’d rely on precedent transactions, here, in order to gauge a baseline value. The best ones to use here are:Beginning with Takeaway/Just Eat, the target was on track to do nearly $1.2 billion in sales this year, which effectively value the company at a 7-8x multiple depending on the final price paid for the company. Amazon’s investment into Deliveroo doesn’t come with details, so it’s difficult to extract anything meaningful as a comparable for a potential acquisition of GrubHub. In looking at the Takeaway acquisition of Delivery Hero’s Germany business, the company paid $1.1 billion for a business that had just over $90 million in sales, valuing it at nearly 12x sales. Granted, these are companies that are growing their top lines at multiples every year, so it is far less outrageous than what it seems at the forefront.Moving forward, GrubHub acquired Eat24 for $287.5 million and while exact financials weren’t disclosed for Eat24, it looks as though the prevailing EV/Sales multiple was somewhere in the ballpark of 5-6x. If we apply the range of EV/Sales multiples to that of GrubHub in a potential acquisition scenario, it’s not unreasonable to expect a $9 billion price tag just above the median. That would result in about a 32% premium from the current level.GrubHub operates in an industry that is rapidly expanding and facing an unprecedented amount of competition. Certain competitors are wising up and realizing that scale wins. That sometimes involve small investments from large corporations and other times that involves multibillion-dollar acquisitions, which may be the case here with GrubHub. Against a 20% short base, speculation of being bought out, and the stock having lost half of its value in the last twelve months, I see scope for owning the shares here with the risk/reward skewed in favor of buyers."

After Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) most recent minority stake acquisition in London-based Deliveroo, investors are struggling in picking a ""winner"" in the global online food-delivery space. Grubhub (NYSE: GRUB) has declined as much as 59.69% over the past 12 months and over 30% in 2019 alone. The main reason behind the decline was the company's market share declining to the 35-40% range after initially being over 50% in the same quarter the prior year. Does this decline in market share translate to such a drastic devaluation of share prices? The answer is no. There is no clear winner in the emerging food-delivery industry which will be characterized by a multitude of dominant companies going forward. Many chain restaurants will expand third-party delivery to multiple partners over the coming years to maximize their potential earnings in the fast food industry. Grubhub has rapidly built upon its capabilities in serving hundreds of US markets and has made key partnerships with companies such as Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) to take advantage of the growing trend. Grubhub will only continue announcing key partnerships and gaining new clients as it expands upon its capabilities. The $65 to $70 range is a bargain for investors who can expect to see shares appreciate to $100 to $105 by year-end 2019.Source: Yahoo Finance.Multiple methods for fast-food delivery options are increasingly becoming the norm among the fast-food industry. Consumers want variety and simplicity and companies have accommodated this trend by increasing their technology and delivery initiatives. As evidenced by the chart below, food delivery apps are by far the most popular method of ordering restaurant food delivery. These will only continue to grow as fintech and app capabilities continue to rapidly complement and align with each other. A survey conducted by Wells Fargo concluded that 51% of subjects currently have five or less restaurant-specific apps on their phones. However, when it came to food delivery, 46% of orders were placed through an app. Only 32% of respondents indicated they called into a restaurant with 19% mentioning they use a computer. Subjects in younger generations were reported to order over 80% of their food delivery through mobile phone apps. This is an important trend major restaurants including Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), and Wingstop (NASDAQ: WING) are well aware of and have adjusted accordingly to through partnerships with companies such as Grubhub and Uber Eats.Source: Wells Fargo.Indeed, Grubhub faces stiff competition from the likes of Amazon, Uber Eats (NYSE: UBER), Postmates, Delivery Hero (ETR: DHER), Just Eat (LON: JE), and DoorDash. So what will propel Grubhub in taking advantage of the growing proliferation of internet and smartphone compatible-apps globally? To start, Grubhub's aggressive growth plan has been fueled by partnerships with hundreds of restaurant chains. The company's $287.5 million cash acquisition of Yelp's Eat24 division solidified the company as the largest online takeout and delivery platform in a key period characterized by venture capitalists injecting billions of dollars into the food delivery business. Another deal with Yum Brands, parent company of Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell, involved Yum purchasing $200 million in Grubhub common stock and announcing an official partnership that marked Grubhub as the company's official delivery partner. Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ: DNKN), NTNs, Jersey Mike's, Smoothie King, Halal Guys, Golden Corral and Smokey Bones are many other notable names the company has partnered with. The recent partnerships effectively give the company the largest share of market access versus any of its competitors at over 19.9 million active users, 2,200 cities in the US and London, and 115,000 restaurant partners as of Q1 2019.Grubhub is also pushing for aggressive expansion into smaller markets through chain partnerships who are scrambling to partner with food-delivery businesses to stay competitive. As the fastest and most effective way to grow market share, partnerships with smaller restaurant chains will be key in Grubhub's effort in continuing double-digit revenue growth. Examples of Grubhub's partnerships with smaller chains include White Castle, Five Guys, Argo Tea, Ruby Tuesday, Corner Bakery, and various other smaller chains.Grubhub is also pursuing further differentiation as evidenced by the company's acquisition of LevelUp which opened up the capability of offering restaurants part of the company's network order new options for in-store order pickup and new CRM and loyalty initiatives to their mobile wallets with the use of LevelUp's white-label tech. Expanding upon pickup options is also an area of concern as the company looks to diversify away from the common notion that it is strictly a food delivery platform. Another potential high-growth area for revenue growth will be the company's marketing plans for restaurants. Due to the well-known and large presence of Grubhub, restaurants will be seeking sponsored listings to enhance their own market presence and expand their customer base. Although Grubhub charges an average of 20% commission on listings, restaurants will quickly realize that any additional charges will be pleasantly offset by higher customer traffic.Source: NYSE: GRUB Past and Future Earnings.There's a reason why Grubhub Chief Executive Officer Matthew Maloney purchased almost $1 million of company stock at the beginning of May in the mid-$60 range. Restaurants looking to grow business will choose a trustworthy partner as Grubhub as one of their first points of consideration. Additionally, higher wages will result in a shortage of in-house delivery personnel which restaurants will look to outsource. This perfect storm complemented with growing mobile technological capabilities illustrates a market that will continue to boom and reap rewards to dominant industry leaders such as Grubhub. With an average commission of 12-13% per order, increasing volumes of orders will only fuel revenue growth as restaurants of all sizes continue to partner with a multitude of food-delivery companies. Grubhub is poised to profit from new app updates, new consumer-facing programs, introductory pilot programs, and restaurant chain expansions. With a 47% year-over-year increase in revenue driven by high growth in active diners, daily average grubs, and gross food sales, revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA are expected to continue their torrid growth with an influx of upward revisions from management and Wall Street analysts. The $65 to $70 range is a great buying opportunity for investors looking for an undervalued stock poised to rise to the $100 to $105 range by year-end 2019.Source: Philly.com."
4272835,104761,2019-06-30T16:04:31-04:00,"Amazon has quit the restaurant delivery business, giving breathing room to the three big players: Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber Eats.Recent market study by Second Measure show that Grubhub remains a leader in a dynamic and evolving market for restaurant delivery.Regardless of how market share shifts every six months, the trend is clear. There are, and will remain, a small number of core players, including Grubhub.Uber Eats and DoorDash remain prominent competitors, but all three are likely to be leaders in the market for the foreseeable future.It is possible Amazon will return to the market via acquisition. Some merger scenarios could hurt Grubhub. Grubhub is a risky investment, but I remain long.","I initiated a position in Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) in the $80s in October and have made subsequent purchases in the $60s and $70s and will continue to hold. As of this writing, we're in the high $70s. While there are multiple players in food delivery, Grubhub continues to stand out as a leading alternative for consumers, thanks to strategic acquisitions, continued restaurant roster expansion, and aggressive marketing.While the barrier to entry to restaurant delivery may be low, as time passes it becomes more and more difficult for new entrants to threaten the position of the leading vendors in the space without a massive infusion of capital to buy market share, build both a driver and restaurant network, and get the attention of consumers.The recent exit of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is proof of this. Though Amazon has a Flex program that hires drivers on a freelance basis to deliver restaurant orders (ended June 24), parcels, and groceries, Amazon was a virtual non-entity in the restaurant delivery space since entering the market in 2015.It is increasingly likely that the big three - Grubhub, Uber Eats (UBER), DoorDash (DOORD) - will continue to dominate the market for the foreseeable future until an acquisition of either DoorDash or Grubhub disrupts the landscape.A recent market report by Second Measure reiterated what we saw last year. The restaurant delivery market is dynamic and growing quickly, with Grubhub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash leading the general market as the three battle for leadership positions in major metropolitan markets.DoorDash has made the most headway recently and narrowly edged out Grubhub for greatest share of monthly sales orders for April.In every major market cited by Second Measure, one of the big three was leading in all except Los Angeles, where Postmates (POSTM) holds the top position.It's interesting to see that Amazon made almost no headway in any of the major markets cited above by Second Measure. The company had a stronger presence in Seattle, where it is based, but still decided to fold restaurant delivery altogether in June after entering the market in 2015.Amazon's exit from domestic restaurant delivery came a little over six months after the company quit its London restaurant delivery operation in December. In May, despite having quit London, Amazon announced its investment in Deliveroo, one of the leaders in the London restaurant delivery market.Now, this is interesting. Many Grubhub bears have said Amazon quit the market domestically because of low margins. I don't know the economics of the London delivery market, but I imagine the business realities of the market in the US are similar to those in London. It remains to be seen what Amazon does with restaurants domestically following its exit from the market. Is Amazon walking away from restaurants forever? I doubt it. It's possible the company will let DoorDash and Grubhub slug it out for several more months before the company decides which one to acquire, if it decides to make an acquisition at all.Grubhub has continued to grow sales aggressively through acquisitions and an ever-increasing investment in marketing. Like Uber and DoorDash, Grubhub has exclusive arrangements with major fast food brands. No one company has an iron grip on the market, and these exclusive partnerships further strengthen the position of the big three versus upstarts.Though I believe Grubhub will continue to hold a strong position, the marketing and pricing wars are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. To Grubhub's advantage, it is a pure player that has been in this market for a while now and has shown profitability. Though DoorDash is growing like wildfire, the company is still not profitable and is fueling market share gains through continual funding rounds from private investors.If DoorDash is acquired by Uber, I think this could spell trouble for Grubhub. Uber would acquire a dominant share in most major markets and could then exert more pricing power to pressure Grubhub. Conversely, an acquisition of Grubhub by Uber could be used to crush DoorDash. And we could potentially see a scenario where both DoorDash and Grubhub are acquired by Amazon and Uber, leaving us with a restaurant delivery market that is reduced to Amazon vs. Uber and the smaller players. I suspect this is where we'll end up. It is also possible that DoorDash could simply try to embolden its place in the market by acquiring the smaller Postmates, which has been rumored in the past. This would hurt Grubhub as well. It's impossible to predict how the mergers will play out, but I believe there will be activity. Time will tell.From a valuation standpoint, one could argue now ($77) is not a great time to be buying Grubhub. Expenses are rising and this is impacting profitability and cash flow generation. At the end of 2018, my discounted free cash flow model gave the company a fair value of nearly $70 assuming a liberal 3% discount rate, the US Treasury 30-year rate. It's fair to argue that this is not enough of a discount rate given the risks. Additionally, it is uncertain how severely cash flow generation could be affected in coming quarters and years as the war with Uber and DoorDash continues. The stock really surged after Amazon's exit from the market. Congratulations to anybody who bought in May in the low $60s. At $77, I view Grubhub as a hold. If you're going to buy here, you might want to consider buying in pieces. The price has been volatile and you might get a better entry point again.It is uncertain exactly how the restaurant delivery market will play out, but I do believe Grubhub will remain a top three player in the market until there is consolidation among the top three - Grubhub, DoorDash, Uber - and/or Amazon re-enters the game via acquisition."
4263789,99986,2019-05-14T10:03:17-04:00,"GrubHub is now down more than 55% from its all-time highs set last year.The company's earnings trend remains strong, with 55% growth in annual earnings per share expected for FY-2020.While the company's fundamental story remains in tact, the technical picture still leaves a lot to be desired.","The Internet Content group has been split among the haves and the have-nots the past year, with prior laggards staging turnarounds like Facebook (FB), SnapChat (SNAP), and Twitter (TWTR), and old leaders plummeting in strength rankings. Unfortunately, GrubHub (GRUB) is in the latter category with other names like Zillow Group (ZG) and Angie's (ANGI) that have had a tough road the past year. The good news for GrubHub investors is that the company's earnings trend remains in tact even with a sequential decline in annual earnings expected for FY-2019. The reason for this is because annual earnings per share are expected to hit another new all-time high in FY-2020, and this would suggest that is just a pause within the uptrend for earnings. While it's possible that the worst is over for GrubHub, patience is required as there are no signs of a turnaround yet from a technical standpoint. Despite GrubHub's technical weakness over the past several months, the company continues to execute and the fundamentals remain in tact. The company announced in the Q1 conference call that they exited the first quarter with 19.3 million active diners, up 28% from the prior year. To put this in perspective, the company added more diners in Q1-19 than they did in all of 2016. In addition, revenue less operations increased from $3.34 per order in Q4 2018 to $3.46 per order in the most recent quarter - an improvement of 3.5% sequentially. The company has stated that this is one of the best ways to measure their delivery efficiency. On the earnings front, the company is investing heavily in sales and marketing, and this is what's leading to lower profitability for FY-2019. The good news is that these efforts seem to be paying off as the company continues to see record net active diner adds despite cost per acquisition [CPA] remaining relatively flat. (Source: Company Conference Call)Digging a little deeper into the earnings picture, we can see that analyst estimates for FY-2019 are for $1.42 in annual earnings per share, a 14% drop year-over-year if analysts are correct in their projections. This is certainly a significant deviation from the prior trend of high double-digit increases in annual earnings per share, but the good news is that it's merely a blip in the overall earnings trend. How so? FY-2020 earnings estimates currently sit at $2.20, a new all-time high for the company. The below chart may help to better visualize the earnings trend, and why the drop in FY-2019 is not a huge issue. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)As we can see from the below chart, the sequential drop-off in EPS in FY-2019 is not expected to do any damage to the overall earnings trend. However, it is important to note that the increase in earnings from FY-2018 to FY-2020 estimates is only 33%. Based on this, we clearly have some deceleration in this trend with average annual earnings growth being halved from the mid 30% range previously to the mid-teens.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Taking a look at revenues for GrubHub, there's no real red flags here at all as revenue growth continues to remain strong in the high 30% range. Q2 2019 revenue growth is expected to decelerate a little based on estimates for $315 million at the mid-point of guidance, and this will translate into 32% revenue growth year-over-year, the lowest rate since Q3 2017. This is still an exceptional growth rate, but once again, we are seeing some evidence of deceleration even if they do meet or slightly beat this guidance.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)So why is a company growing revenues at the mid 30% range with earnings expected to hit a new all-time high in FY-2020 down 55% from its highs? Margins continue to trend lower on a trailing twelve-month basis. The company continues to see gross margin contraction on a trailing twelve month basis and perceptions are that this will only continue with competition heating up. GrubHub's CEO Matt Maloney stated on the call that the company differentiates itself from competition given how they share customer data which is extremely valuable to restaurants. This is certainly a valid point to give them a competitive advantage, but the perception that margin expansion will be difficult to achieve is certainly a fair one. Gross profit-margins are down from a high of 60% in late 2015 to 42% in the most recent quarter, and the trend has shown no signs of reversing just yet. (Source: MacroTrends.net)A company expecting a new all-time high for earnings per share with 35% quarterly revenue growth is certainly not a write-off just because of margin contraction, but ideally, the stock better have a very lovely chart to make up for it.In the case of GrubHub, the stock is in the bottom 5% of stocks in terms of performance over the past nine months, and the stock has been left for dead for the most part. The bulls seem to be putting up a fight at the $64.00 level, but a move above $89.50 will be required to confirm the lows are likely in. So far the buying pressure is constructive at the $64.00 level, but I believe it's still too risky to call a bottom just yet. As can be seen, the $64.00 level shows a faint green support line, but strong support sits at $48.00 if this bottom does cave in on the stock.(Source: TC2000.com)Looking at the weekly chart below, the $89.50 level also coincides with where the 40-week moving average sits currently. This is the minimum requirement I would like to see to believe that a turnaround is likely. This is because the first meaningful sign of a turnaround in a stock that's beaten up is a weekly close back above the 40-week moving average (pink line). The small silver lining for the bulls here is that there seems to be a potential that we may be seeing accumulation with buyers finally outweighing sellers from a volume standpoint the past four weeks. It would ideal if we could see an additional few weeks of this accumulation to better confirm this. (Source: TC2000.com)So what now?If you believe in the earnings growth estimates and believe that gross margins have bottomed out, the only key left is the technical picture firming up with a weekly close back above the 40-week moving average. I prefer both the fundamentals and technicals to line up to make new purchases, so GrubHub does not meet my criteria just yet. The earnings growth trend is exceptional though if they can beat estimates of $2.20 for FY-2020.GrubHub is a tricky investment choice here as while revenues and earnings remain strong, margins are creeping lower. The chart does not inspire much confidence, but the key will be to see if buyers show up at the $64.00 area on a weekly close. The best investments meet all four criteria (margins, earnings, sales, and above 40-week moving average), and GrubHub only meets two requirements. Based on this, I will continue to keep an eye on the stock for a move back above the 40-week moving average, but am being patient here as there are too many conflicting signals to bottom-fish just yet."
4273145,98726,2019-07-02T12:09:12-04:00,"Amazon exited the online food ordering and delivery marketplace, but it remains a cut-throat competitive space. Moats are hard to come by.Grubhub has lost the leadership it used to enjoy. Market share erosion and deterioration of profitability are recent, worrying trends. Doordash's market savvy and Uber Eat's cross-sale opportunity constitute significant predicaments.Grubhub is profitable, unlike its two main rivals.Investing in the firm is a leap of faith, prevaricated on investors' belief that management will carry the day, which it may very well do.","Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent market exit can only be a relief for all remaining players in the food delivery service space. The market is sizable, and the opportunity enticing. But the competitive landscape, which we propose to analyze, remains cut-throat. In the absence of a true moat, only the most talented management team will win, which brings me to Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB).Grubhub's CEO and founder Matt Maloney bought shares and has an impressive track record in the industry, which bodes well for the stock, and GRUB also enjoys a first-mover advantage, a robust tech stack, and, unlike its main rivals, a rather consistent record of profitability. Add competitors' Achilles' heels and merger opportunities into the mix, and a bullish case seems in order.Grubhub is a leading online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders. The company has grown its active diner network to 19.3 million users who can order from more than 115,000 takeout restaurants in over 2,200 cities. For restaurants, Grubhub generates takeout orders from diners at full menu prices without adding seating capacity or wait staff. GRUB does not charge the restaurants on its platform any upfront or subscription fees and only gets paid a percentage of the transaction on orders processed, providing restaurants with a low-risk, high-return solution. Paying a higher commission rate affects restaurants' prominence on the platform. GRUB empowers diners with a user-friendly interface that helps them search for and discover local restaurants and efficiently place an order from any Internet-connected device. Today, only 5% of U.S. restaurant sales are online, leaving GRUB -- and its key rivals -- with an enormous untapped market to try to service. Mobile food ordering grew 130% from 2016 to 2018, with mobile now constituting 60% of digital orders, and mobile apps help generate incremental revenue and encourage repeat purchases. However, only 31% of Quick Service Restaurants have mobile apps for ordering and only 32% offer delivery through apps like Grubhub. Such trends have likely contributed to the recent flood of capital in the online food delivery sector, with venture capital firms investing $4.8 billion across 60 deals in food-delivery companies in 2018, the most transactions ever tracked in the vertical, according to PitchBook Data Inc. DoorDash has raised $2 billion, including a $600 million round of financing in May (its second round this year), giving it a valuation of $12.6 billion and Amazon led a $575 million round of funding for U.K. delivery service Deliveroo. Postmates also raised $400 million in the last six months of 2018.Source: Grub's Annual ReportSource: E*TRADEIt sure tells us investors something that omnichannel retailer Amazon has decided to close its 4-year-old restaurants delivery service (by the end of June '18). GRUB shares jumped on the news. Unfortunately, AMZN probably exited the market for a reason; it was late to the dance and might have had a hard time reaching profitability and market domination in what essentially is a cut-throat competitive environment. Not only is GRUB wrestling with rivals in an increasingly crowded space, but some of the biggest restaurant operators are also pushing back against fees charged by delivery companies, placing undue pressure on all market participants (and likely adding complexity to any new market entry). GRUB primarily competes with the traditional offline ordering process used by the vast majority of restaurants and diners involving paper menus that restaurants distribute to diners, as well as advertising that restaurants place in local publications to attract diners. For restaurants, GRUB offers a more targeted marketing opportunity than local advertising mediums like the yellow pages since diners typically access the Company’s platform when ready to place a takeout order. The Company’s online competition consists primarily of national and local service providers, point-of-sale module vendors serving some independent restaurants' standalone websites and the online interfaces of enterprise restaurants offering takeout. Compared to other online platforms, GRUB offers diners a wide range of choices (>115,000 restaurants), limited cost delivery, menu price parity with any other online ordering venues and full price transparency with no hidden fees.Unfortunately for GRUB, this only tells us part of the story. As is made clear in the graph below, competition has strengthened considerably and rivals, particularly DoorDash and Uber Eats, have gained market share. Other key competitors include Postmates and Square-owned Caviar, which do not seem to be gaining much momentum at this juncture. Source: Second MeasureIn May 2019 DoorDash and GRUB were tied for 32% of the market. Other recent statistics reached slightly different conclusions, with DoorDash becoming the top on-demand food delivery service after overtaking GRUB in consumer spending market share, according to data released by third-party research firm Edison Trends. In dollars spent, GRUB has steadily lost ground. Uber Eats, which has flat lined (and actually seems to have trended slightly down over the past six months, retreating even more sharply in May), takes the third spot claiming a still impressive 20 percent of the market. It's essentially become a three-horse race. But DoorDash and GRUB increasingly seem neck-to-neck. What's more, five-year-old DoorDash's win is GRUB's loss. DoorDash has almost doubled its percentage of consumer spend in just a little over a year. In July 2018, DoorDash’s market share reached little more than half of GrubHub’s 34.4 stake. Two rounds of capital raise from the likes of SoftBank, Sequoia Capital and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, have given DoorDash capital to expand into even more markets, grab share, and build up its merchant services engine, which, according to CEO Tony Xu, constitutes the key reason why DoorDash has been able to reach partnerships with 90% of the top 100 restaurants, thereby becoming the fastest growing service in the space over the past 12 months. Though DoorDash and GRUB lead in consumer spending, they seem to trail Uber Eats in total number of transactions. Uber Eats likely experienced rapid growth shortly after launching in 2016 because it had a built-in marketing tool with Uber’s ride-hailing services. If Uber Eats is able to increase transaction size per order, and maintain or increase market share (i.e., reverse most recent trends), the service could quickly challenge, if not surpass, its rivals in consumer spending. Uber Eats’ partnership with McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) (landed in 2016) and other merchants entails smaller tickets items. In 2017, McDonald’s expanded its Uber Eats partnership to offer delivery service from 5,000 of its more than 37,000 locations. Some of Uber Eats' rivals also rely upon quick service restaurant chains, though. (Interestingly, many Uber Eats customers don’t even use the ride-hailing service: Last year, four of every ten people who used Eats were new to Uber, giving the company access to fresh customers who might later be convinced to give the car service a try.)From the above, we can draw two key conclusions.1) In the food delivery business, there is no clear winner yet. The race remains open. The competitive landscape has essentially become a trifecta - GRUB, DoorDash, and Uber Eats - with smaller players like Postmates (expected to publicly list shares this year) and Square's Caviar seemingly unable to catch up, at least for now.2) Recent competitive dynamics tends to confirm the market knows no moat. It is thus possible, but still a bit of a stretch, to anticipate GRUB generating excess returns on capital on a consistent basis over the next decade. The company has yet to carve out a sustainable competitive advantage. Put another way, there does not appear to be any significant customer switching costs from one platform or merchant to another, and while GRUB has developed a marketplace network of restaurants and users, several well-capitalized rivals have been able to build out similar networks. Partnerships with restaurants for the most part remain nonexclusive.It's a fast-paced, very fluid market. GRUB, DoorDash and Uber Eats track sales performance on a daily basis and adjust go-to-market parameters to enhance penetration and stave off competition -- modulating marketing tactics, operating discounts, targeting specific audiences in the process -- all of which impact both the top and bottom lines of market participants continuously. Charges and service fees, minimum orders per amount, surge pricing, key merchant relationships and geographic coverage, are other defining factors in the race, calibrated real-time.To an extent, if one of the firms mentioned above has a moat, it probably is Uber Eats, which has the luxury to cross-sell online food ordering and delivery to its current, much larger transportation, peer-to-peer ridesharing, and ride service hailing client base. In this context, the recent degradation of its market positioning comes as a bit of a surprise. Uber Eats seems to be facing dilemmas of its own, challenges that its two main pure-play food delivery rivals don't have to overcome (more on this below). This intense competition may limit GRUB's take rate growth, and higher costs associated with the expansion of delivery service may impede operating margin expansion. As a result, assigning the firm a 10-year average operating margin of 20% indeed remains a challenge. Market share and bottom line (fair value) uncertainties run rather high. Market leadership perpetuation is far from guaranteed, and actually is already being disputed. Now I remember reading similar analyzes of Netflix when the likes of Wal-Mart were pursuing Netflix's business. It turns out Wal-Mart exited the DVD-mailing market shortly thereafter and Netflix's stock took off (to never look back, at least so far!). Granted, Wal-Mart never came close to owning a 27% market share (à la Uber). But the market is crowded, and some of GRUB's peers include well-capitalized rivals, in addition to local service providers. GRUB has created a network effect, strengthening further with the virtuous cycle driven by an increase in diners on one side and in restaurant partners on the other. However, this network is no longer strong enough to be considered an economic moat source for GRUB, as other rivals again have created similar platforms. With low barriers to entry, the firm's leadership could be at risk in the long run. Lower price might become the only differentiator among the players in this space, giving more leverage to companies that have access to more capital and that are benefiting more from brand awareness. Grubhub needs to continuously spend to acquire diners while competition may pressure margins. GRUB's more aggressive ad spending in the short term could yield brand loyalty in the long term, but there is reason why its key rivals could not do the same. The capital infusion that DoorDash and other rivals have enjoyed and an expansion of national chain partnerships likely constitute other near-term headwinds for GRUB profitability potential (with deliveries subsidized, courier incentives increasing, and take rates declining).Given the above, it is not difficult to understand why some are willing to short GRUB. An erosion of the firm's market share and deterioration of its profitability are both clear concerns. In sum, sellers have a point. Of course, in a fast-growing market there is enough opportunity for three competitors to thrive. Uber Eats' recent deceleration may also work to GRUB's advantage. Fine. But we want to make sure that GRUB is able to fight back. After all, DoorDash has shown spectacular market savvy and could become the dominant player, with even GRUB largely displaced. And Uber Eats is far from out yet, obviously.CEO Matthew Maloney purchased about $1 million worth of GRUB on April 30, 2019, at a price of $64.87 per share -- an encouraging sign. What does he see that shorts may miss? The firm also enjoys strong institutional sponsorship. Baillie Gifford and Company, which was an early investor in some of the world’s most valuable private and public tech companies including unicorns from nearly all generations -- Amazon, Google, Salesforce, Tesla, Airbnb, Spotify, Palantir and even SpaceX -- owns 10%. (Check out Baillie Gifford's portfolio, a terrific source of inspiration, here.) The VanGuard Group also owns about 10% of shares. BlackRock owns close to 5%, Morgan Stanley 4%, amongst other funds (as of March 31, 2019).There must be comparative advantages to Grubhub's offering. Let's try to delineate the firm's competitive edge then. Indeed, GRUB does offer a number of characteristics that its rivals may in some cases have a hard time to match at this juncture - key market differentiators and decisive leads or even probable winners.GRUB's entry in the market five years ago has enabled the firm to build brand equity and create superior network effects. Increases in the number of restaurants on the GRUB's Marketplace make it more attractive to diners and increases in the number of diners in turn make the Platform more attractive to restaurants. Scalability of the platform has the potential to lessen the firm's annual capital expenditure and allows it to lower its take rate and compete more effectively with newer entrants in the market. However, as indicated above, this network is no longer strong enough to be considered an economic moat source for GRUB, as other rivals have created similar platforms and functionality, even if more recently. Over the years, GRUB has also been able to fine-tune a number of go-to-market practices and in the process create key competitive advantages. A recent upgrade by Citi highlights GrubHub’s improvement in its delivery network “efficiencies” and possible partnerships. Early tests with McDonald’s, Starbucks and other large chains show the firm still enjoys significant momentum. Likewise, Dunkin’ Brands recently announced a new “Dunkin’ Delivers” online ordering & delivery service offered through Grubhub & Seamless. The service will launch across 400 Dunkin’ restaurants in all five boroughs of New York City, expanding to Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia “in the coming months”. Although Dunkin’ is also available on DoorDash in New York, only a couple of restaurants are listed.In November ‘15, Dunkin’ first tested mobile ordering through a partnership with DoorDash. The partnership launched at 120+ restaurants in Maine, 20- in Dallas, then expanded to Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington DC, followed by New York and New Jersey in ‘17. However, in February ‘19 Dunkin’ announced it would begin testing delivery through Grubhub. Full integration with POS was mentioned as one of the decisive factors -- highlighting how GRUB’s investment in providing restaurants with a full tech stack (with seamless POS integration & order processing) may help it counter DoorDash and other rivals' offensives. Dunkin’ has invested in its digital capabilities by implementing new “Next Gen” store designs, mobile drive-thru lanes, dedicated pickup stations, and digital order status boards, at select restaurants. GRUB's value-add tech stack and leading collection of merchant relationships appear to be synergistic with customers' tech requirements and constitute paramount competitive advantages.Mobile food ordering is growing fast, and mobile apps help generate incremental revenue and encourage repeat purchases. GRUB also offers customizable integrated technologies that support digital orders with point of sale system integration, customer relationship management and loyalty programs, actionable insights to optimize delivery, menus, pricing. GRUB provides diners with outstanding choice as it aggregates menus and enables ordering from restaurants across more than 2,000 U.S. cities (as of December 31, 2018). A user-friendly platform makes ordering simple from any connected device, thus bypassing phone orders and error prone processes. It is key to remember, though, that, while GRUB has largely been able to capitalize on all these tech and data trends, GRUB competes with other online platforms based on its ability to generate additional orders via technology and other means, manage challenges such as customization, menu updates and to help restaurants improve their operational efficiency. Product innovations in POS integration, mobile application development, or customer relationship management programs, as well as providing a seamless diner experience, are not merely GRUB's prerogative. To sum it up, Uber or even DoorDash will strike few as tech laggards... Again, Grub has a solid offering, but no moat per se.As indicated above, GRUB has been operating in the black rather consistently. While recent competitive pressure seems to be eroding profitability, the firm does not face the same predicament as DoorDash and Uber Eats: both rivals run significant losses.Further, the three firms may operate with slightly different margin generation profiles. DoorDash has special partnerships with a number of popular restaurants, including Jack in the Box, Cheesecake Factory, IHOP, and Taco Bell. It recently started working with Wendy’s, shortly after Uber Eats began a partnership with McDonald’s. But many of these wins are prevaricated upon rather uneconomical or low-margin meal-delivery transactions. Mario Cibelli of Marathon Partners commented in Barron's that one transaction from an independent restaurant could accrue the same gross profit as close to ten orders from a national fast-food chain, which tend to exhibit rather low meal prices and afford poorer returns on investments. Therefore, making independent restaurants one of its sweet spots could actually help any competitor like GRUB formulate a winning strategy. Of course, solid earnings is what makes or breaks a great stock. GRUB's track record thus augurs well for its shares. To the extent that the firm is able to preserve it, the stock could, possibly should, reveal itself as a long-term market winner. GRUB has pursued expansion opportunities in existing and new markets, as well as in core and adjacent lines of business through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that have helped accelerate growth. Indeed, the firm's recent acquisitions of Tapingo Ltd., a leading platform for campus food ordering, LevelUp, a leader in mobile diner engagement and payment solutions providing restaurant partners with powerful CRM and analytical tools to increase sales, Yelp's Eat24, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yelp Inc. and provider of online and mobile food-ordering services for restaurants across the United States, A&D Network Solutions, Inc. and Dashed, Inc. (collectively, “Foodler”), a food-ordering company headquartered in Boston, and more, show the firm is aggressive in its pursuit of market domination including via mergers and acquisitions. The absence of significant competitive moat and embrace of tech may explain why the firm has struck a number of deals, and may seek to swallow additional competitors and adjacent players in the foreseeable future. (If you can't beat them, buy them...)This said, the firm faces competition in that arena, too, as some of GRUB's rivals have access to even more capital and can initiate and finalize large M&As, as well. In other words, fierce competition during any consolidation period could raise acquisition prices dissuasively for GRUB, and more likely than not minimize returns on potential investments.Further, GRUB's many assets, competitive positioning as a co-market lead, and enterprise value of $6.9 billion make it a potential takeover target for bigger tech companies that want to dominate the food delivery space. Amazon has been named as a potential acquirer. After all, AMZN's recent exit of the U.S. food delivery space may make even more sense if the e-commerce juggernaut finds it easier to acquire a lead contender in the vertical than to develop organically and likely too late. The integration of Whole Foods' groceries into GrubHub could constitute a game-changer, as well. Other tech giants may also get interested.Not only does GRUB exhibit a number of competitive advantages (albeit no moat per se), but its rivals also seem to have their share of weaknesses and liabilities. As indicated above, both GRUB's competitors have yet to reach profitability.Further, they face a number of distractions. For instance, DoorDash has pursued an aggressive and successful growth strategy. But in the process, the competitor has been known to deliver food from restaurants that had not given them explicit permission to do so. These practices have given diners more options but have angered some restaurants, such as In-N-Out Burger, resulting in lawsuits.Uber Eats, while deemed a top priority within Uber, has had to overcome its own distractions, which may help explain the company's recent market share erosion. For example, not so long ago, Uber’s executive team fell apart in the wake of reports of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and questionable business ethics.GRUB and DoorDash's single-minded focus on food delivery may also serve both competitors well. Although it is as easy to argue that Uber may be able to overcome short-term distractions quickly and enjoy plenty of runway in a vertical where, granted, it is a rather new operator, but can cross-sell into its huge ride-sharing client base. GRUB enjoys a number of advantages but no moat and has to stave off competition from savvy marketers and well-capitalized rivals. In this context, quality of leadership appears more crucial than ever. Matt Maloney, the founder and CEO of Grubhub, has a solid track record. Under his leadership, GRUB has grown its active diner network to 19.3 million users who can order from more than 115,000 takeout restaurants. He has led the company through five rounds of investment funding, several mergers, and a 2014 initial public offering. Matt was named one of America's most powerful CEOs 40 and under in Forbes Magazine in 2016 and one of the top 50 business people of 2014 by Fortune Magazine. Likewise, under the tenure of Adam DeWitt, President and CFO of GRUB, the firm's annual revenues have grown from $20 million to more than $1 billion. The executive has co-led the company through its initial public offering in 2014. Before joining Grubhub, Adam was the CFO of publicly-held optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. and held financial leadership roles at JPMorgan Chase.Sam Hall, chief product officer of Grubhub, was chief product and technology officer of ClassPass, leading the company’s engineering, product and design teams. Previously, he spent nearly 10 years at Amazon and served as vice president of consumable customer experience, overseeing worldwide product management, design, data analytics and engineering for cross-category products and programs. Sam also held the position of vice president of mobile at Amazon, where he was responsible for mobile shopping apps for phones and tablets, along with the company’s mobile websites worldwide.Clearly, GRUB has a solid management team. Not that DoorDash or Uber are necessarily left wanting in this area. This said, ethical dilemmas at the former and recent management instability at the latter may have constituted unwelcome distractions in a recent past.Of course, you never know how far down a stock will go before initiating a turnaround. Now that the bulk of competitive threats to GRUB are priced in the stock, what else can hit? Some further erosion of the firm's leadership is a clear risk. Uber is a formidable competitor, and DoorDash has grabbed an impressive amount of market share in a rather short time. Unanticipated revenue/earnings shortcomings are always contingencies, of course. A market downtrend and more volatile stock market in general could also inflict pain. M&A integration headwinds may constitute another impediment. Potential disruption to the closing of recent acquisitions would also present a risk to Grubhub. GRUB has significant room for growth in the US ahead, but will need to invest internationally if it decides to expand geographically. In turn, many international markets have their respective food delivery leaders deep-seeded and entrenched. In conclusion, GRUB's leadership in online food delivery is being challenged. The firm has lost the clear market edge it had sustained for some time. It may be able to reclaim it. Top management, a solid embrace of technology and deal-making, and a rather consistent (if recently called into question) record of profitability, bode well for the firm. But the absence of a true competitive moat and emergence of two top competitors in Uber Eats and DoorDash surely complicate matters. Great leadership will indeed be required for GRUB to triumph. Some quick notes:"
4256875,61171,2019-05-03T10:30:00-04:00,"After a sharp pull-back in its share price (54% off 52-week high in Sep), we believe GrubHub's risk reward ratio is attractive.The fact that GrubHub's market cap (US$6.28 bn) is lower than privately held DoorDash's latest valuation of US$7.1 bn indicates valuation for the former has hit rock bottom.Moreover, GrubHub's fundamentals remain solid as it is a consolidator in an industry that is growing structurally.Catalysts to realize our upside scenario (50% upside potential) include easing competition and adjusted EBITDA/order improving sequentially.","We take a close look at GrubHub (GRUB) as its share price has declined by 54% off its 52-week high in Sept. Given our long-term value-based investing style, this kind of share price correction certainly piques our interest. As a company backdrop, GRUB is the nation’s leading online/mobile food ordering and delivery platform connecting diners with local restaurants. As of Dec. 2018, the company has 105K restaurant partners mainly in 2K U.S. cities. Its portfolio of brands includes GrubHub, Seamless, Eat24, Tapingo, LevelUp, AllMenus, and MenuPages.The big question to ask is clearly why GRUB’s share price has corrected sharply since it hit 52-week high of $149 in Sept. In short, the main reasons to this are 1) heightened competition concerns and 2) first quarterly GAAP net losses in 4Q18 (or adjusted EBITDA decline of 26% YoY, vs. a robust 31% EBITDA CAGR in 2015-18). As for stiffer competitive landscape, investors have been concerned, given the big amount of PE/VC funding piled into GRUB’s competitors. A case in point, privately-held DoorDash raised $400 mn at valuation of $7.1 bn in Feb. This is on top of two previous funding rounds in 2018 that raised a total $785 mn. Another competitor, Postmates (also a privately held firm), notched $100 mn investments at a valuation of $1.85 bn in Jan. Last year, Postmates managed to raise $300 mn.And, let’s not forget the ride-hailing giant, Uber (UBER) that would become a public company next month. Uber is reportedly looking for $90-100 bn IPO valuation, including roughly $10 bn it expects to raise in the IPO. Uber has a food delivery arm called Uber Eats that, from our observations and TV advertising, is clearly very aggressive in its efforts to take market share. Uber’s S-1 filing indicates that Uber Eats’ adjusted net revenue has declined sequentially in 3Q18 and 4Q18 despite its gross bookings still growing sequentially. This means that Uber Eats has poured in much more investments (in the form of drivers’ incentives).Hence, GRUB’s 4Q18 GAAP net losses announced in Feb. is sort of market vindication on heightened competition derailing growth story. As said, adjusted EBITDA (which is a much more important metric investors track) declined by 26% YoY to US$42 mn. Adjusted EBITDA/order in 4Q18 fell to only $0.99, from $1.57 plus in 1Q-3Q8 and $1.51 in 2017.In light of stiffer competition especially from DoorDash, Postmates, and other start-ups, we believe that GRUB's biggest competitive advantage is being an early mover. And, importantly, we like that management does not rest on its laurel. In fact, from its early mover's advantage, management has built other competitive advantages to fend off competitors. First, it is pro-active in capitalizing early mover's advantage by becoming bigger fast through bolt-on acquisitions. For example, in 2017-18, GRUB completed 4 bolt-on acquisitions (Tapingo, LevelUp, Eat24, and Foodler). That's why GRUB's gross food sales have grown by 29% CAGR in 2015-18, higher than 22% CAGR (Morgan Stanley estimates) for digital food delivery industry.Furthermore, we are very supportive of management spending $20 mn increment on S&M (sales & marketing) expenses in 4Q18. This means that management is pro-active in brand building. As anecdotal evidence, we do notice GRUB's aggressive TV advertising (which is a good brand-building) while watching TV at home. With GRUB becoming more of a household brand, this clearly could serve as a competitive advantage to fend off competitors.With food delivery being a consumer service, strong distribution network (measured by the number of restaurant partners in GRUB's case) is a competitive advantage as well. On the restaurant partners count, we do see GRUB expand aggressively as well. For example, as of Dec. 2018, GRUB has 105K restaurant partners, more than doubling 50K restaurant partners as of Dec. 2016. For consumers themselves, more restaurant choices are clearly preferred when it comes to picking an online food delivery platform to use.Last but not least, GRUB is the largest online food delivery in the U.S., meaning it has the largest economies of scale relative to competitors. When push comes to shove in terms of competitive intensity, economies of scale certainly would come in handy for GRUB. Also, with economies of scale, GRUB has a better bargaining power relative to restaurant partners.From this point on, we opine that looking on heightened competition concerns and bad 4Q18 results (which we just did) is equivalent to looking at a rear-view mirror, which is not good when evaluating a stock. In fact, to us, this is the time to digest and see through the noise to get a clear fundamental picture of GRUB and to eventually weigh if the competition concerns have been overblown or the market has over-punished the stock/valuation.So, let’s clearly lay out fundamentals picture of GRUB. The first thing worth noting is that all the funding frenzy into GRUB’s competitors is a testament to the fact that the digital food delivery industry is in a structural growth phase. Morgan Stanley Research estimates that, in 2015-18, the industry has grown by 22% CAGR. In particular, GMV/orders placed through online delivery platforms (vs. restaurant direct) was the stronger growth segment, posting 36% CAGR (vs. only 10% CAGR in restaurant direct segment). More importantly, despite the 22% CAGR, the penetration rate of digital food delivery industry remains at a low 8-9% in 2018. This compares very favorably, say, to online travel segment’s penetration rate of 38%.Our demand mini-model assuming penetration rate of 8.6% in 2018 and Morgan Stanley figure of $18.5 bn suggests that, at 11.6% penetration rate in 2021E (1 ppt improvement each year), the digital food delivery industry would reach $29.8 bn in 2021E, size-wise. This implies a still robust 17% CAGR for the industry. More importantly, online delivery platform segment (where GRUB operates in) would grow at a higher 23% CAGR. Hence, the big implication of this forecast/exercise for GRUB is that 18-20% CAGR in its organic gross food sales (this already implies small MS loss amid 23% CAGR for online delivery platform segment) is a very reasonable assumption for the next few years.Regarding GRUB's market share (we simply plug in GRUB's gross food sales as a percentage of digital food delivery market), it appears that GRUB has gained market share, from 24% in 2016/17 to 27% in 2018. But this seemingly contradicts market share movement provided by Second Measure. We believe the explanation lies in that in Morgan Stanley's digital food delivery market, restaurant direct segment is included, while Second Measure only count online food delivery platforms.Hence, the key story is that GRUB has gained market share (in the context of digital food delivery market) at the expense of restaurant direct channel. Meanwhile, among online food delivery platforms, DoorDash and Uber Eats are the clear big market share winner (based on Second Measure's data). We are not particularly concerned with Second Measure's market share data mainly because GRUB had a much bigger size relative to other online food delivery platforms back in Dec. 2017 or earlier (the law of big numbers puts GRUB at a disadvantage in terms of growth). With a much bigger base for both DoorDash and Uber Eats starting in Dec. 2018, we believe, going forward, the market share gains for DoorDash and Uber Eats would be much more muted. So, we expect a less dramatic market share movement among online food delivery platforms in 2019 onwards.Meanwhile, as for competition's point of view from restaurants' perspective, clearly, the more customers/active diners an online delivery platform has, the more preferred the platform would be. The bottom line for restaurants in partnering with an online delivery platform is much bigger sales/orders that positively correlate with active diner networks on an online food delivery platform. As a channel checking, we talked to a restaurant owner that uses GRUB platform. The reason is simply that his restaurant sales rose by 50-60% post partnership, with the increments primarily coming from food delivery (instead of dine-in sales).As of Dec. 2018, GRUB has 17.7 mn active diners, which is the largest active diner network among online food delivery platforms. Hence, GRUB would enjoy certain competitive advantage or bargaining power relative to restaurant partners. Based on GRUB's take rate, restaurant partners pay roughly 20-22% commission (of total order in $) to GRUB.As stated, given all the funding frenzy into GRUB’s competitors, investors are concerned (rightfully so) with the stiffer competitive landscape. However, one important thing to say here is that stiffer competition is a part of life in any industry. In other words, competitive landscape flows and ebbs (not a constant, it can heighten or ease in a period). Hence, we would categorize stiffer competition as a cyclical headwind, not a structural one.With all the funding received by GRUB’s competitors, of course, they have to show that they are aggressive in taking market share. But, at a point down the road, they also have to show at least path to profitability to their investors by focusing on margins. It is fair to say that it is such a futile exercise to predict how long the heightened competition would remain. Nonetheless, a year from now, IPO of Uber (and potentially Postmates in 2H19) could be a positive for GRUB in that the pressure from being a public company could pave the way for easing competition sooner rather than later.During 4Q18 earnings call, management also did not provide clear guidance on the timing when competition would ease. What management said, though, is that GRUB expects average adjusted EBITDA/order to improve throughout 2019, signaling easing competition as the year progresses. Rising adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA/order is the clear sign of easing competition as during 4Q18, $42 mn adjusted EBITDA was shaved off by around $30 mn incremental expenses ($10 mn increment in operations and support expenses to expand into new markets and $20 mn increment in S&M expenses). Adding back $30 mn incremental expenses would get to adjusted EBITDA of $72 mn, which is higher than $60-67 mn EBITDA in 1Q-3Q18.In particular, by 4Q19, management stated its expectation of average adjusted EBITDA/order to be much closer to $1.57 (3Q18 level). Mid-point EBITDA guidance of $250 mn for 2019 implies average adjusted EBITDA/order of $1.31, assuming 20% growth in Daily Average Grub (DAG, essentially a number of orders).As a comparison, for 1Q19 guidance, $45 mn adjusted EBITDA guidance implies average adjusted EBITDA/order of $0.94 (pretty similar to 4Q18 level). This means that management does not forecast imminent turnaround, but more of a gradual one (sequential improvement throughout 2019). However, we think that as a long-term value investor, this is the cyclical weakness where investors have to take advantage in terms of the stock's entry price level.The third fundamental point to highlight is that GRUB does not face existential threats. Unlike brick and mortar retailers facing such a threat due to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), GRUB is on the right side of the big trend (offline to online). As mentioned earlier, online food delivery platform (instead of restaurant direct) is the fastest growth segment in the digital food delivery industry (that in itself is in a structural growth phase).Furthermore, GRUB is the only profitable online food delivery platform on GAAP basis. Despite 4Q18 GAAP net losses, for the full 2018, GRUB posted GAAP net profit of $78 mn. In fact, since its inception as a public company in 2014, on a full year basis, the company always posted GAAP net profit. Adjusted EBITDA margin is an enviable 23-31% in 2014-18.The same (achieving GAAP profitability) can’t be said regarding other online food delivery platforms. For example, DoorDash has indicated to Bloomberg and CNBC that it is yet profitable. It did mention that sales tripled in 2018 (our estimate is US$500-600 mn, making it around one-half of GRUB’s revenue). Meanwhile, Postmates is a much smaller company (our estimate is US$300-400 mn sales in 2018). Unfortunately, Uber does not break down Uber Eats’ (more of a global food delivery platform) sales geographically. Assuming US/non-US sales mix (56/44) on a consolidated basis, we estimate Uber Eats generated US$818 mn sales in 2018. This would make Uber Eats the second largest online food delivery platform after GRUB, which is pretty consistent to market share picture tracked by Edison Trends.Coming back to no existential threat argument, not only GRUB is profitable on GAAP basis, it also generates positive operating cash flow (average $160 mn in 2016-18, with 2018 being the highest at $225 mn. FCF before acquisition capex was also positive each year in 2016-18 (average $118 mn). Hence, unlike typical young internet or consumer technology platforms, GRUB does not burn cash but generates FCF before acquisition capex. On balance sheet, as of Dec. 2018, GRUB has $225 mn cash and cash equivalent holdings, vs. $342 mn debt. Hence, net debt of $116 mn implies net debt/adjusted EBITDA of a mere 0.5x on a TTM basis.Let’s turn to the valuation, especially peers comparison. First, we would like to assess the downside scenario. For the peers comparison, at the moment, there is only one apple to apple comp (pure online food delivery play) on the U.S. public companies side: Waitr Holdings (WTRH). However, WTRH is a much smaller company (only $69 mn sales in 2018, $766 mn market cap). Like other competitors, WTRH posted net losses ($34 mn in 2018). For the valuation comp, we also incorporate DoorDash and Postmates using latest Private Market Valuation (PMV), based on 2019E P/S comparison (the relevant valuation metric for young internet/consumer technology platforms as most don’t have earnings). GRUB trades at 4.6x multiple, a deep 28% discount to the U.S. peers average of 6.4x (also 6.4x ex-Uber).Assuming Postmates’ valuation as the floor valuation (4.2x P/S), we arrive at the bear case’s intrinsic value of $62, implying a downside potential of 9% from current share price. Of note, we think Postmates’ much lower valuation multiple is attributable to the fact that it has grown in line with the industry (vs. DoorDash gaining market share rapidly and reportedly overtaking Uber Eats as the second largest food delivery platform in early 2019). Hence, Postmates’ valuation as the floor valuation for GRUB is a reasonable assumption given the latter’s constant (or slightly lower ex-acquisitions) market share narrative.Another thing to note is DoorDash is valued at US$7.1 bn in Feb., higher than GRUB's 6.28 bn market cap. Clearly, something is off, valuation-wise, when the largest online food delivery platform is valued lower than the second largest player. This also indicates that our intrinsic valuation of US$5.75 bn (our downside scenario) for GRUB is very conservative.Looking at European markets, we found three online food delivery platforms: Takeaway.com (OTCPK:TKAYF), Just Eat (OTC:JSTLF), and Delivery Hero (OTCPK:DLVHF). Again, based on these European peers, online food delivery platforms are valued on a P/S multiple basis since they haven’t posted profitability. The European peers trade at average 7.3x 2019E P/S, a 14% premium to the U.S. peers average. GRUB’s floor valuation we use for the downside scenario (4.2x P/S) is at a deeper 42% discount to European peers’ average. This again serves as a sanity check that our floor valuation multiple is reasonable.For the upside scenario, we would like to use a normalized earnings multiple method to capture a scenario where competition has returned to normal. Specifically, we use normalized adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate to be $476 mn or $1.73 adjusted EBITDA/order (happening in 2021 for our base case earnings). For the multiple, we use 20x. As a sanity check, 20x plus 2021E EV/EBITDA multiple can be seen in consumer technology platforms that enjoy structural growth phase such as Chegg (24.7x), Stitch Fix (27.7x), or Etsy (24x). Assuming 20x EBITDA multiple, we arrive at an intrinsic value of $102/share for GRUB. This implies 4.5x 2021E P/S, which is reasonable in terms of sanity check. The $102/share intrinsic value further suggests 50% upside potential.GRUB’s share price has corrected sharply by 54% to $68 level since Sept. Heightening competition (validated by 4Q18 GAAP net losses/big decline in adjusted EBITDA) is the primary culprit. However, a close look into GRUB’s fundamentals shows that the digital food delivery industry remains in the structural growth phase (20% CAGR for online delivery platforms segment is possible next few years). This means that there is plenty of growth pie to spread around.Moreover, heightening competition we see currently is a function of funding frenzy recently piled into GRUB’s competitors. This being said, at one point down the road, the PE/VC investors would demand GRUB’s competitors to show profitability. In other words, heightening competition should be seen a cyclical headwind, not a structural one. Furthermore, one important fundamental point regarding GRUB: it is far ahead of others in terms of profitability and FCF ex-acquisition capex. Unlike other consumer technology platforms that burn significant cash, there is no existential threat for GRUB.As for GRUB’s stock price at this level, we see compelling risk reward ratio emerging. Specifically, the downside scenario points to intrinsic value of $62 (floor valuation set by Postmates’ 4.2x P/S), implying only 9% downside potential from current share price. Meanwhile, we foresee $102/share intrinsic value for GRUB, utilizing normalized earnings/adjusted EBITDA method. This suggests 50% upside potential. Hence, the risk reward ratio is an attractive almost six to one upside to downside ratio."

He compared Grubhub's logistics business to the likes of FedEx (FDX), and expressed negativity regarding that particular aspect. Maloney explains that the competition's logistics focus is about low margins, and Grubhub is about high-margin ""demand generation.""The issue is the market for restaurants to drive demand is incredibly competitive. Restaurants have ample choice in this department. Competitors could further leverage their platforms to compete in demand generation. Recently, Grubhub's stock has been under pressure from fears related to growing competitive threats. Competitors such as Uber Eats (UBER) and DoorDash (DOORD) have gained ground.Grubhub is really a low-cost platform for restaurants to gain access to demand. Grubhub is one of many platforms that diners can choose to receive the benefits that it offers. For this reason, Grubhub's most important metric is active diners. Grubhub's value is having active users on its platform to drive demand. The business is very similar to its rivals. It comes down to gaining users. The competition and economics of the space make owning Grubhub shares too risky at the present time.Source: MonexValue to diners is the most important fundamental reason for Grubhub to exist. If Grubhub is not useful to diners, it's not useful to restaurants. The customer is first and foremost. Grubhub needs volume to be useful. It has gained a great number of users through acquisition, in particular its Eat24 purchase from Yelp (YELP) in Q4 2017. Eat24 has since been integrated into Grubhub's main platform. What Grubhub really bought was diner volume.Grubhub is known as a food delivery service to consumers. As Maloney has pointed out, this is a fairly simplistic low-margin business. There's an interesting difference between what the public believes Grubhub to be and what the company does that could generate future shareholder value. The logistics makes Grubhub appealing to consumers, but boosting restaurant sales is what makes the company compelling to investors.This is not unlike the value proposition of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The sheer number of users offers value to advertisers in the same way that Grubhub does for restaurants. The company is more segmented but also more straightforward. The platform is limited to restaurants, but restaurants hope partnering with Grubhub will increase demand.The problem is restaurants have numerous tools to drive demand. Facebook and Google advertisements are one large avenue. Its competitive advantage on this front is low costs. GRUB takes a commission on sales that its platform generates. There are no up-front costs for restaurants.Even a company as large as Yum! Brands (YUM) believes that partnering with Grubhub can increase incremental sales. It seems as if Yum sees the most value in the access that Grubhub's delivery service gives to diners. The company believes that this access will drive sales. Online ordering and home delivery is more efficient and creates cost saving. Restaurants can save by leveraging existing infrastructure.It's intriguing that Grubhub does not include delivery as a key benefit for diners in its Form 10-K. Grubhub outlines its top diner benefit as discovery. However, delivery seems to be the real value added to diners as opposed to discovery. The glaring challenge for discovery is competition with Google. This is the central bearish thesis for Yelp (YELP). I think many diners will continue using traditional methods for takeout. Many people will also simply use Google as a means of discovering new restaurants. But the space is so big that there is runway to make the niche interesting to investors.Grubhub faces competition on numerous different fronts. It faces direct competition from similar services and more broad ranging competition for certain services. The benefit is that the company offers something slightly different than more broad ranging competitors.Source: BloombergTwo years ago Grubhub had a commanding lead in the space. With the Eat24 acquisition, Grubhub theoretically should have grown to about 50% market share.Source: Forbes/Edison TrendsIn more recent history, Grubhub's market share has been eroded away. The value proposition is connecting restaurants with consumers. If other services are able to drive more demand, they are more valuable. In 2017, Grubhub was far and away the best game in town. Now, Uber Eats and DoorDash are on par. I believe that there is enough market for all three remains relevant. After all, the United States has 660,000 restaurants in total. But the competitive landscape makes it uncomfortable owning Grubhub.With DoorDash recently receiving a $7.1 billion valuation, it is no wonder why Grubhub has sold off. DoorDash is taking market share from Grubhub. DoorDash has succeeded by using a divide and conquer strategy following a Saudi-backed investment. DoorDash has rapidly expanded to new cities and bolstered its market share. This should concern Grubhub investors and will certainly dictate near-term stock movements.Data by YChartsGrubhub's stock has been obliterated over the past year on the threat of competition. Unlike Uber or DoorDash, Grubhub turns a profit. I would expect in the near term that valuation will depend on market share. I'm not buying that Grubhub is substantially differentiated from Uber Eats or DoorDash. The question will be if the general economics of the industry will produce strong profits.It's a game of numbers. These top three players have pulled so far ahead that they have some semblance of competitive advantage. Again, I think the space is big enough for all three competitors, but what is Grubhub worth after losing market share?Grubhub's run to nearly $150 was completely delusional and irrational in my opinion. It took pressure on margins for Wall Street to begin to sell off Grubhub. The company's eroding market share was a forward-looking indicator to margin pressure. Maloney noted in the CNBC interview that the company will spend what is must on growth. This is the only way forward for Grubhub. It has seen DoorDash come from nowhere with this strategy and pose a threat. Grubhub is taking a page out of its playbook.I would expect earnings in the more near term to continue to be pressured. With that in mind, valuing Grubhub is about thinking in terms of scale rather than current ratios. Grubhub should be discounted less than DoorDash because of its ability to turn a profit. The issue is it seems like that profit has cost Grubhub to a degree in the future. GRUB spending and pounding the pavement is the right strategy for now. Worrying if this will create lasting value is a justified concern.With the vastness of the restaurant business, Grubhub could be in growth mode for quite some time. Investors must always consider future cash flows to properly value a business. With Grubhub, investors will have to wait a little longer. The costs of growing the business make the future earnings picture very cloudy.Grubhub has rapidly lost market share to DoorDash. This is a concern, even if the market is large enough to accommodate multiple players. I do expect Grubhub to remain relevant into the future. I also expect DoorDash to take a more commanding lead in terms of market share. Owning Grubhub is owning the second or third best player in online food ordering. The concern is the difficulty in predicting how profitable this type of business will be. The low-cost demand generation that GRUB offers restaurants is what still makes the business attractive.The fear regarding the company is certainly justified. The risk that Grubhub and its competition slug it out in a price-chopping, low-margin business keeps me out of this one. Commissions could easily come under pressure. Grubhub is at a crossroad between a high-growth tech company and a low-margin logistics business. The business as a whole is somewhere in between. The platform that drives demand for restaurants is the only thing separating online delivery economics from something like ride sharing.If investors take in all of the factors in consideration and believe that scaling in this industry will deliver to the bottom line, Grubhub might be worth a shot. Especially if Grubhub can innovate to take more share from DoorDash. The ecosystem seems fairly sticky, it's going to be a difficult task.While I don't believe the sell-off to be unjustified, there very well could be opportunity moving forward. If an investor is confident in Grubhub's future, now would be the time to buy at 52-week lows."

Cleverly referred to as the virtual food court, we are witnessing a quite seismic shift in how people order food and choose to eat. Bloomberg says,Ten or so years ago, the companies that took on initiatives to grow and invest in eCommerce saw their long-term plans come to fruition, and there have been some who chose not to adapt. In the food industry, we are seeing a similar change. As Mark Twain would say: ""history doesn’t repeat itself but it does rhyme.""Former Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) CEO Nigel Travis recently bid farewell to his long career in the food industry. Near his retirement, his last few conference calls involved a foreshadowing of the mobile food delivery market, one he suggested would be a game-changer. He said:I would like to initiate a buy recommendation on GrubHub and conduct a top-down analysis. By first looking at sales trends, GrubHub's portion of these sales and then best estimates of the market going forward. I believe GrubHub's sales in the coming years can accurately and conservatively be extrapolated in a manner to suggest there is significant upside regarding this stock.Our video version of this article:GrubHub's business model is to take a portion of sales from restaurants for providing an effective, convenient and infallible service of handling the delivery and order process. They have built a vast network of relationships with restaurants and consumers that has spread far and wide across America.Some interesting statistics regarding the company are:Source: GrubHub: Third QuarterAnd, given that they get a portion of the total sales, a crucial metric in analyzing the company is what Bloomberg refers to as GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume). A term interchangeable to GrubHub’s Gross Food Sales (their term in their corporate filings). This term tells us the raw dollars diners have spent on the platform. GrubHub’s top line is almost completely derived from this figure.Source: Bloomberg: Mobile Food Delivery MarketMarket Gross Food Sales (figures in Billions)GrubHub's Gross Food Sales in the same time period (Billions):In other words, from 2014 to 2018, GrubHub has, through its platform, represented a portion of the online GMV market of 18%, 19.13%, 19.34%, 19.2%, and 20.64%, respectively. They have also increased it at an average rate of 66 basis points and accelerating faster as of recent.And, again, because GrubHub's top line is almost completely derived from GMV, their sales and cut of the dollar volume on their platform have been as follows (figures in Millions):GrubHub's sales as a cut of GMV on their platform are growing and have recently hit just above 19%. Again, rising by 136 basis points or 1.36% on average. As the Bloomberg chart shows, in the next few years, estimates of the online delivery GMV will continue on its path of robust growth (in Billions):It is no secret that the competition in this market has been intensifying. With companies such as Uber Eats, Door Dash, and Skip The Dishes all looking to expand, some might suggest GrubHub's going to have it rough. But GrubHub has an edge the other companies don't, a first-mover advantage. Data from Mckinsey shows that 80% of users are likely to stay with the app they first tried.Which means the large population of users they have acquired is likely to stay. This implies there's low switching activity, an attractive feature that should give shareholders a sigh of relief. It also lets us assume GrubHub can fend off competitors and maintain dominant market share.Source: Bloomberg: Mobile Food Delivery MarketGiven that GrubHub's Gross Food Sales as a portion of the market as well as their revenue as a portion of Gross Food Sales have continuously increased, we'd like to skew our forecasts upwards to suggest they can maintain this. GrubHub's top line, in the coming years, would be as follows (Figures in Billions, excluding per share data):Going forward, the revenue growth is expected to eventually slow down. The chart above shows revenue growth going from 31% growth in 2019 to 32% down to 29%.GrubHub's PS stands at a 5-year average of 9.65 and at 8.1 today. However, I do not think this can be maintained because revenue will slow, and their PS ratio is already at a quite large premium relative to peers. Applying a PS ratio closer to GrubHub's Peers identified by Capital Cube as those in the Leisure, Arts, and Hospitality Industry gives us a more conservative estimate.Source: Capital Cube: GrubHub Peers AnalysisGrubHub's peers stand at a median PS ratio of 5.27. I'd like to pull back GrubHub's PS ratio over the long term near this figure, but still considering the fact that GrubHub should command a higher valuation, given it has higher growth in its engine than its peers who have grown their top line at 9.18%.GrubHub has the ability to serve its debt obligations quite comfortable. On its balance sheet, it has long-term debt of $290,073, short-term debt of $6,250, and at the same time, cash & equivalents of $294,550 (figures in millions). In a time of rising interest rates, looming debt obligations are an existential predicament for many companies. Fortunately, GrubHub's figures suggest neither liquidity nor debt payback is a problem that will surface anytime soon.Furthermore, they have a $200 Million investment from Yum Brands (YUM), the parent company of a few local restaurants you may have heard of in KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. Which reminds me of a similar investment McDonald's (MCD) made in Chipotle (CMG) in its early days, one that was immensely profitable for McDonald's and led to Chipotle much better off when the two entities parted ways. A mature and established company acting as the big brother and offering guidance may be exactly what we are witnessing here with GrubHub.The time horizon for this investment is 1-4 years as pointed out by the model. I identify this as a growth play that is ideal for the investor that can handle the risk and volatility associated with this company and industry that is still unraveling and developing every day. GrubHub does have high valuations and is expected to grow substantially quarter after quarter, year after year. Therefore, the market will be less tolerant in the case of any mishap, hiccup, or weak period financially. This will likely result in the stock price deviating away from the long-term price targets. This is a risk investors should be well aware of.With that being said, GrubHub has momentum, this market is not slowing down, and though it may be on the riskier end of things, I believe shareholders will be rewarded handsomely commensurate to these risks."
4257151,103480,2019-04-26T13:09:32-04:00,"Shares of GrubHub wavered between gains and losses after reporting Q1 results that beat on both the top and bottom line.
        Revenue growth has stabilized around the ~40% range, despite decelerating sharply last quarter.
        Most encouragingly of all, GrubHub's count of active diners jumped in the quarter, thanks to the company's rollout of several national partnerships.
        GrubHub remains one of the only tech stocks that has not rallied in 2019. If strong results continue, the stock could stage a rally in the back half of 2019.","After a shockingly disappointing quarter in Q4, GrubHub (GRUB) has come bouncing back with bullish results in the first quarter of FY19. The food delivery giant has been under fire on all fronts this year - from dealing with a deceleration in both revenues and gross food sales, to competitive noise from UberEats (UBER) as the rideshare company prepares to go public at an ~$80 billion valuation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, GrubHub has been one of the only technology stocks to not surge alongside the broader market recovery this year. The stock is down 5% year-to-date, and relative to all-time highs just under $150 notched last September, GrubHub shares are still down more than 50%.I was initially hesitant on buying GrubHub on last quarter's dip. However, two key factors have changed since then:In my view, given this fortuitous combination of better fundamental trends and a lower share price, I'm more inclined to bank on a recovery rally for GrubHub in the back half of 2019. Investors would do well to buy on any dips.First, a closer look at GrubHub's focus on national partnerships. One of the core drivers behind this quarter's outperformance was GrubHub's partnership with Taco Bell, one of the core brands in the Yum! (YUM) portfolio. Though the Taco Bell deal was not new, this quarter saw some more aggressive joint marketing campaigns, which produced tremendous results. CEO Matt Maloney called out on the Q1 earnings call that the initial Taco Bell campaign is ""just the beginning"" of how GrubHub and Yum! will cooperate in the future to market at-home delivery across all of its brands, including KFC and Pizza Hut. As the food landscape changes, particularly the fast-food scene, the giants of the restaurant industry have had to alter their distribution tactics in order to reel in millennials who are increasingly hooked into healthy eating movements. GrubHub is one of the best solutions to capitalize on the on-demand convenience angle that millennials adore. Here's some further color from Maloney's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:As previously mentioned, GrubHub has been far more successful than any of its competitors at forging blue-chip delivery partnerships. Going forward, continued rollouts with national brands will be key to preserving revenue growth.Here's a look at GrubHub's results in the first quarter:Figure 1. GrubHub 1Q19 resultsSource: GrubHub Q1 press releaseRevenues grew 39% y/y to $323.8 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $322.2 million (+38% y/y) by a point. This growth rate is more or less in line with GrubHub's 40% y/y growth rate in Q4, which had missed Wall Street's consensus by one point. Though GrubHub has still fallen sharply from the ~50% growth rates from last year, it's encouraging to see that GrubHub's revenues have more or less ""stabilized"" despite the intensifying competitive chatter, particularly around UberEats. (On the competitive side, it's worth noting as well that DoorDash raised $400 million within the quarter and upped its valuation to $7.1 billion. To the extent that DoorDash's raise gives more resources to a big competitor, it's also a signal that investors are valuing the food-delivery space more highly as well).Driving this revenue growth was a record quarter in active diner growth, for the second consecutive quarter. A good chunk of the new diners came from the Taco Bell push, but management also noted that even without the Taco Bell campaign, ""organic"" growth would have been on par with last quarter's growth rate. The below chart showcases GrubHub's progress on key metrics in the quarter:Figure 2. GrubHub key metricsSource: GrubHub Q1 press releaseActive diners rose 28% y/y to 19.3 million, accelerating quickly over the 22% y/y growth pace in Q4. This also represents a net add of 1.6 million new diners in the quarter (versus 17.7 million in Q4), which is an all-time record for the company. Note also that Q4 itself, with 1.1 million net adds, was also a record for the company. Gross food sales, meanwhile, rose 21% y/y to $1.50 billion. It stands to reason that gross food sales are growing more slowly than diner growth, as GrubHub has shifted more into low-value fast foods like Taco Bell and Auntie Ann's. Note, however, that gross food sales kept pace with last quarter's 21% y/y growth rate, and also that GrubHub's take rate (its cut of revenue from each diner transaction) increased to 21.6%, up 90bps from 20.7% in the year-ago quarter. GrubHub also impressed on the cost front this quarter. On a GAAP basis, sales and marketing costs jumped 61% y/y to $78.5 million, faster than revenue growth - however, underneath the hood, GrubHub's management has noted that ad efficiency is up. CFO Adam DeWitt noted the following (key points highlighted) on the Q1 earnings call:Despite the aggressive increase in sales and marketing costs and the resulting drop in operating income, GrubHub managed to rake in a positive EPS. In fact, the company's pro forma EPS of $0.30 smashed Wall Street's estimate of $0.25 with 20% upside. The market hasn't been patient with GrubHub, succumbing too quickly to competitive noise and becoming dismayed with GrubHub's slowing revenue growth. However, I believe a patient investor who is willing to wait for the outcome of GrubHub's partnership with Yum! (which will hopefully encourage more big chains to join in) can scoop up shares of this delivery giant near 52-week lows. Stay long here."
4237630,104761,2019-02-02T02:31:50-05:00,"GrubHub is nearly 50% off its 52-week high going into Q4 earnings on February 7.Increased expenses going into Q4 and general market sell-off punished the stock following Q3.Though there are concerns about increased competition, GrubHub is still growing at a rapid rate and has strong brand recognition and is tops in market share.Despite a strong January for stocks in general, GrubHub still attractively priced at $80 going into Q4 earnings.","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) stock is coming off a rough three months as the company prepares to report Q4 earnings. While the stock has gotten hammered following Q3 results, I viewed the sell-off as an opportunity to initiate a position, which I did in the $80s, and added to it as the stock cratered into the $70s and high $60s. The stock hit a high of nearly $150 last year. Q3 results were great as the company reported 37% organic revenue growth in addition to growth from recent acquisitions. The company has a track record of beating revenue growth expectations since late 2015. Going into Q4, the company actually upped revenue guidance. However, the company reduced Q4-18 EBITDA guidance by $25 million to support growth expenditures for Q4. Though GrubHub is the market leader, competition remains stiff. The Q3-18 report comes on the heels of Uber Eats announcing its intention to reach 70% of U.S. population by the end of 2018. Despite the growing competitive landscape, GrubHub's performance this year has shown that the company continues to expand and will be a dominant force in food delivery for the foreseeable future. GrubHub has entered 100 new markets through three quarters, prematurely meeting the annual goal of 100 established by the company before the year began. In support of rapid revenue growth, the company in Q4 will spend about $10 million (unexpected) to help ramp up those new markets. The company will also spend an additional $10-20 million (unexpected) on additional marketing, and spend another $2-3 million (unexpected) on recently acquired LevelUp. In addition to the Q4 spend increase, the company boosted Q4 low-end revenue guidance by 8% to $283 million.Some bears argue that the new expenses are proof that GrubHub will have to continue to spend more to sustain and expand market share. As food delivery competition intensifies, margins will continue to contract. That said, as the market leader, GrubHub has some first-mover advantages. Its name is synonymous with food delivery. It does one thing and does it well. Though the market is evolving quickly with market share being grabbed by the likes of Uber Eats and Door Dash, GrubHub is still growing fast and continues to hold the top market position. The company also touts its lower fees compared to rivals. A quick check by me of a popular restaurant in my neighborhood yielded the following results:Door Dash (DOORD) won on price because of a temporary promotional offer. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was second on price, but you have to be a Prime member to qualify for restaurant delivery. I am not an Amazon Prime member. Absent Amazon, GrubHub wins on normalized price. When I have ordered from restaurants in the past, I've paid little attention to the delivery fee and have simply paid the fee without question if the restaurant I wanted was available. I have used Caviar once for the promo code, but have not gone back due to the limited restaurant offerings. GrubHub recently stated it has 95,000 restaurants and counting. I have never had trouble finding what I've wanted on GrubHub and typically default to GrubHub or Uber Eats when I'm looking for food. With its first-mover advantage, marketing push to further strengthen brand awareness, and growing roster of eateries, GrubHub continues to strengthen its position as a default option in food delivery. New delivery startups may pop up in my area tomorrow, but they're going to have to spend a lot of money in giveaways and restaurant additions to get my attention and convince me to delete my GrubHub or UberEats app to make new space on my phone for yet another app. There is plenty of market opportunity for food delivery. Statista predicts the food delivery market will grow >7% annually through 2022. With GrubHub and competitors frantically jockeying for leadership positions in major cities, it seems likely that there will be more mergers. It was reported that DoorDash had considered merging with rival PostMates earlier this year in order to compete more effectively with GrubHub and Uber Eats.GrubHub flirted with $150 this year. As of this writing, it's at $80. The early October market selloff shaved about $30 off GrubHub's share price before the Q3-18 call, which led to GrubHub dipping another 10-12% below $100/share before the general market selloff shaved more off the price, leading it to the mid-$80s. I initiated a position in the $80s and made subsequent buys in the $70s and high $60s. The trailing PE of the stock over the last four quarters is 53. Earnings growth between Q4-17 and Q3-18 has exceeded 120%. That gives us a PEG ratio today of less than 0.50. Given the company's track record and the growth runway ahead, I think GrubHub is still attractively valued going into Q4 earnings. GrubHub is a growth company trading at an attractive price given the runway ahead of it. I have made multiple purchases after the recent selloff and plan to hold onto my shares for the foreseeable future."
4236018,32121,2019-01-29T07:15:07-05:00,"GrubHub has been growing inorganically by acquiring smaller players in the food delivery space.Despite contracting margins and increasing competition, we believe that despite no moat, GRUB is positioned to remain the industry leader.After declining 47% and currently trading at a forward PEG ratio of 0.56, we believe the stock is attractive.","GrubHub (GRUB) has remained the market leader in the online food delivery industry in the U.S. for years, but at present, its market-leading position is threatened by a hoard of competitors that are not only focused on capturing the massive growth opportunity of the food ordering and delivery industry, but also on chipping away existing market share from GrubHub. Profit margins are compressing, and the company has been forced to spend more on marketing and decreasing fees in order to remain competitive.After being in the industry for more than a decade, GrubHub has attracted enough competition from big players, a testament to the opportunities available in the industry despite doubts that competition casts over future profitability of the company.The company is certainly facing headwinds in the industry, and despite a multiple that looks rich on the surface, it is more modest when considered in light of expected revenue and earnings growth.GrubHub, founded in 2004, is the leader in online food ordering and delivery industry in America. The company currently offers ordering food from more than 95,000 takeout restaurants.(Source - Edison Trends)GrubHub merged with Seamless in 2013, and this marked the beginning of another era, in which the consolidated company has been able to dominate the industry. GrubHub has continued to grow inorganically as well, using acquisitions to support its growth.As a result, the company has an impressive portfolio of brands.(Source - Company website)Being one of the earliest players to enter the industry, GrubHub was able to quickly redefine how diners order food and restaurants market their products to diners. GrubHub's revenue arises from fees and commissions charged from restaurants for every successful order routed via the company's platform.Over the last five years, the company has made a series of acquisitions that has helped it consolidate its market-leading position, while delaying the threat of competition.(Source - Crunchbase)The platform to consumer delivery industry has grown exponentially over the last few years, driven by changing consumer behavior. As with other things, consumers now prefer to order their food online and get it delivered to their doorsteps, or to make their take-away order ready by the time they reach the outlet.Revenue growth in the platform-to-consumer delivery segment(Source - Statista)The user penetration rate at the moment stands at 5.8% and is expected to surge to 7.8% by 2023. In fact, the penetration rate could be much higher as technological advancements are paving the way for companies to engage with users more efficiently.One of the major functionalities of third-party, independent food delivery networks is the flexibility it brings to restaurants. For example, a customer would be inclined to order food from a restaurant if he knows the order would be fulfilled within a reasonable time frame and at an affordable cost, regardless of where the restaurant is located. However, restaurants themselves cannot cater to such requests as it would be too costly of an operation. In addition, these delivery platforms remove the burden of managing logistics for the restaurants. The restaurant then pays a commission to the third-party delivery platform on successful completion of an order, routed through their platforms - an order that might not otherwise have resulted in a sale had it not been for the availability of a delivery service. And the restaurant or the food outlet does not incur any additional overhead costs such as salaries, fuel costs, insurance costs or training costs.On top of these benefits, third-party delivery platforms have become natural marketing platforms for local restaurants. Small-scale restaurants and food outlets enjoy the freedom of being able to list their menus with established food ordering platforms, which act as a marketing campaign in its own right, as users scroll through restaurants and menus on these third-party platforms.Currently, there are a few noteworthy players in the industry.These industry participants are competing with rivals to scale up their market share and achieve growth. This intense competition has become an intrinsic feature of the industry and more often than not, these participants are competing on price.A major, distinctive feature of this industry is the fact that users appreciate the industry as a whole, as it provides them with the flexibility to order food from their couches and save time, while being able to enjoy a variety of food at their convenience. Companies within the industry have failed to build stickiness around their brand names, however, as users hop from one platform to the other to enjoy deals and associated benefits.Since there are no switching costs, diners gravitate towards the provider offering the highest benefits. Therefore, companies have struggled to build a true loyal customer base, which has intensified the competition of the industry.To succeed as a food delivery company in the long-term, a company needs to have a strong competitive advantage. Consistent returns above economic costs of the firm will diminish eventually, if the company does not have a strong advantage over its peers and competition is based solely on price.I have used three important metrics, taken from Porter's Five Forces analysis, to evaluate GrubHub's competitive position in the food ordering and delivery industry.As an industry becomes profitable, this will naturally attract new players to the industry as is the case here. If there are no or less barriers to entry, new players will enter the market and competition will eventually lead to a loss in profits and revenue to existing players.Eventually, companies would not be able to achieve economic profits in the long-run and one or a few survivors will be left with the majority of market share, but at the expense of lower profitability.The food delivery industry has virtually no barriers to entry, and this has already attracted many new entrants into the industry. The non-existence of barriers can be attributed to a wide array of reasons:The industry as a whole will be exposed to much more fierce competition in the coming years, which would make it impossible for existing players to expand profit margins meaningfully without a competitive edge.While GrubHub's market share has declined sharply during the last couple of years, it still maintains a robust 34% market share and now has a network of over 45,000 restaurants through both organic and inorganic expansion.(Source - Edison Trends)Moving forward, the company will face tougher competition as stronger players survive at the expense of smaller and weaker players. This will likely lead to more contraction of profit margins, but could potentially be compensated for by higher revenue growth.Meanwhile, GrubHub will also have to spend an increasing amount of money on marketing and advertising as competition heats up. This was already confirmed in the most recent earnings conference call:While higher spending on marketing and advertising cannot be classified as a warning sign in its own right, higher spending on ads in the food delivery industry does raise some concerns. The primary reason behind this is the non-existence of brand loyalty. Even though higher ad spending might contribute toward growth of the company in the short-term, customers acquired through this higher spending are not guaranteed to stay with the firm in the future unless the company develops some level of stickiness.Therefore, while it is likely that higher spending on marketing and advertisements might only provide the company with favorable short-term results, it may lead to long-term stickiness even if brand loyalty remains fleeting.As noted in the earlier segment, players in the industry are exposed to strong competition from existing and new entrants. There is no customer loyalty toward individual companies, and there is virtually no difference between the quality of the services provided - at least not yet - except for the number of restaurants available on each platform. Therefore, industry players have embarked on a competitive strategy based almost entirely on pricing - although we point out that GRUB has built its network to over 45,000 restaurants.One imminent threat which tends to turn industries upside down is Amazon (AMZN). Amazon has launched Amazon Restaurants, which enables the company to cross-sell its food delivery service to its massive existing user base, while Uber Eats enjoys the advantage of a massive user base spread across the world.These players will up the ante in the industry, and GrubHub will have a tough time competing with the deep pockets of these two players, but does have a lead within the industry.There are no switching costs, as noted earlier, and while this will further incentivize price-based competition, the availability of more restaurants on the platform may provide support to pricing as some consumers will put a higher value on choice than a pure-pricing comparison. If not for choice, however, large companies stand to gain as they can take advantage of lower cost structures and maintain higher levels of marketing spending on a more consistent basis.Most of the partnerships with restaurants and food outlets are also non-exclusive, which allows such food outlets to work with multiple delivery partners and making it more difficult for a leader to emerge. However, Yum! Brands (YUM) announced that GrubHub would become the exclusive deliverer of KFC and Taco Bell - a deal in which Yum will purchase $200 million of GRUB stock and the president of Pizza Hut will join the GRUB board.The threat of substitutes is extremely high, with services like grab-and-go or in-home cooking services like Hello Fresh, but for grab-and-go, locations must be convenient enough for consumers to want to go there to pick up the food, while services like Hello Fresh still require some ""work"". They are certainly threats, but we don't think consumers using food delivery services will necessarily abandon the model even when these other options are available. Our family, for example, consistently uses all three of those channels to put food in our bellies.GrubHub is operating in an industry which is poised for growth, but at the same time, companies representing the industry are in for a bumpy ride and possibly, new entrants with strong track records in other industries will have a meaningful impact. GrubHub has already lost a significant portion of its market share to new entrants and will probably look for more acquisitions to ensure growth.Its past M&A activities are proof of management's capability and willingness to capture inorganic growth opportunities and this might be the only way to maintain or grow market share.So far, GrubHub's acquisitions have integrated nicely and have contributed to the growth story of the company. However, going forward, it would not be able to acquire its targets for discounted prices, as competition will heat up for acquisitions. Deep pocketed rivals such as Amazon and Uber will likely create havoc in the industry and cause valuations to increase.On another note, margins are already compressing. While this is expected as an industry grows and becomes mature, this is not an industry that is done growing nor is it close to maturity. In fact, with only a 7.8% penetration rate expected by 2023, we would have expected margins to remain stronger for a longer period of time. The caveat here is that there is still lots of upside to the penetration rate.(Source - Author prepared based on company filings)Moving on to ratio analysis, the company trades at a P/E of 50, which may seem rich, but is in line with the PEG ratios of comparable internet and software services companies.We prefer to value this company using a PE to growth ratio, which at the moment is 0.56 on a forward basis.Consensus analyst forecasts for 2019 EPS are $1.94, which would also imply a much more reasonable forward PE ratio of 42.While the current valuation may not provide a margin of safety for the company, this stock is for investors with a long-term perspective and a high tolerance for short-term fluctuations.GrubHub is an attractive company, with a proven track record of delivering on its promises. However, the current competitive environment does pose some risks. Investors need to focus on this competitive environment as GrubHub does not have an economic moat and most continue to invest to maintain its lead in the space.That said, the stock has declined 40% in the last six months based primarily on lower EBITDA margins. While that is usually not a good sign, we see value in the company's growth strategy that will still drive strong EPS growth even as marketing spend and opex increases.Disclaimer: This article is meant to identify an idea for further research and analysis and should not be taken as a recommendation to invest.

4239741,103480,2019-02-10T16:08:04-05:00,"GrubHub shares sank in the double-digits after reporting large misses to Wall Street estimates in Q4, before rebounding to a slight loss.Revenue growth slowed down to just 40% y/y, far lower than 52% y/y in the prior quarter.In addition to weaker top-line growth, GrubHub's losses widened, and GrubHub's 2019 profitability forecast is equally dour.Investors could also be reacting negatively to the announcement of Postmates' impending IPO as a signal of fiercer competition.Given GrubHub's perennially high valuation is anchored to high growth, it's a good time to dump GrubHub shares.","For many years, GrubHub (GRUB) has long been an investors' favorite within an otherwise-hated food technology sector. More than any other food tech company, GrubHub has managed to continually post electrifying growth rates (albeit helped by M&A) while continually expanding its addressable market and slimming its loss profile. Now however, it seems that GrubHub's victory parade has begun to slow down. Q4 was a mixed quarter for many companies, with management teams across the board citing a slowdown in global growth for weak results - and unfortunately for GrubHub, we saw one of the most marked paces of deceleration this quarter in the tech sector. Shares initially fell as much as -15% in response to the Q4 print, before rounding out to single-digit losses by the end of the day:Data by YChartsGrubHub's fall from grace, in my opinion, is a reflection of the stock's premium valuation (especially against other consumer technology stocks, which have re-rated negatively since the December pullback). That high valuation rests on the assumption of equally high growth - and if GrubHub fails to deliver that premium growth, the valuation must come down. Part of the problem isn't just anchored on growth, but on future profitability as well. GrubHub.Figure 1. GrubHub guidanceSource: GrubHub Q4 earnings releaseThe company's FY19 guidance range of $1.315-$1.415 billion represents 36% y/y growth over FY18 revenues of $1.007 billion, and while that represents a marked deceleration from 47% y/y growth in FY18, it's still above consensus forecasts of $1.34 billion (+33% y/y). Where investors took issue, however, was the light EBITDA guidance. The company's forecast of $235-$265 million in adjusted EBITDA falls far short of the $302.4 million that Wall Street was hoping for. In addition, it's essentially flat to the $233.7 million of adjusted EBITDA that GrubHub generated in FY18.For a company of GrubHub's scale, growth isn't the only factor to look at anymore: at a >$1 billion revenue run rate, GrubHub also has to demonstrate its ability to scale profitably. The company currently has a market cap of $7.61 billion and a net debt position of $116 million - indicating an enterprise value of $7.73 billion. This represents a multiple of 31x EV/FY19 EBITDA against the midpoint of next year's low-growth EBITDA forecast range - which makes GrubHub seem incredibly overvalued.Investors may also be reacting negatively to the news of an impending Postmates IPO. Long a popular unicorn that has competed against GrubHub for loyal users, the publicity of the Postmates IPO brings to mind a frequent topic for GrubHub bears: rampant competition. The on-demand food delivery space has no shortage of contenders, including UberEats. GrubHub's growth so far has been strongly fueled by M&A, but with the company already in a net debt position and forecasting limited EBITDA growth, it can't continue to fuel acquisition-driven growth forever.Though I was bullish on GrubHub when it was smashing Wall Street estimates on a regular basis and growing at >50% y/y, GrubHub's most recent results give me pause on the company's outsized valuation. In my view, now would be a good time to lock in gains.Let's dive deeper into GrubHub's fourth-quarter results. Take a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 2. GrubHub 4Q18 resultsSource: GrubHub Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 40% y/y to $287.7 million, falling one point short of Wall Street's expectations of $290.0 million (+41% y/y). Perhaps even worse, however, is the fact that GrubHub's revenue growth decelerated sharply - by twelve points - relative to last quarter's growth pace of 52% y/y.GrubHub's key business metrics also saw a marked slowdown:Figure 3. GrubHub key metricsSource: GrubHub Q4 earnings releaseIn particular, note that gross food sales slowed down to +21% y/y growth, down from 23% y/y organic growth last quarter. On the bright side, however, GrubHub increased its active diner base to 17.7 million, or an increase of 1.1 million net diners in the quarter - a new record for the company. It remains to be seen, however, if GrubHub can convert these new diners into regular users to drive food sales. We can see, however, that GrubHub's growth initiatives have eaten into the company's bottom line. Matt Maloney, GrubHub's CEO, acknowledged that the company spent heavily on advertising in order to achieve these results on the Q4 earnings call:Sales and marketing costs exploded 54% y/y to $69.9 million, eating up 24.2% of GrubHub's revenues - 210bps higher than 22.1% in the year-ago quarter. Primarily as a result of this boost in marketing spend, GrubHub's operating profits slumped into a loss of -$2.8 million this quarter, representing a -1% GAAP operating margin - versus a positive operating margin of 12.8% in the year-ago quarter.GrubHub's pro forma EPS of $0.19 also widely missed Wall Street's mark of $0.28. In addition, adjusted EBITDA - GrubHub's primary metric for defining profitability - took a tumble as well. The company's adjusted EBITDA sank -26% y/y to $42.1 million, representing an EBITDA margin of 14.6% - substantially lower than 27.8% in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street, by contrast, was expecting $47.2 million in EBITDA, or a 16.4% margin.Figure 4. GrubHub adjusted EBITDA bridgeSource: GrubHub Q4 earnings releaseCracks are beginning to show in the GrubHub story. Once we move past a year where acquisitions drove much of GrubHub's top-line growth, the company's revenue numbers will start becoming more unimpressive. At the same time, GrubHub is spending heavily in order to organically attract new diners - and while this is certainly driving a bump in ""grubs"", it's sinking GrubHub's operating margins. With the weakness seen in this quarter's results, GrubHub will likely undergo a multi-quarter correction and vacillate between gains and losses until the company can show better results. In my view, it's best to stay on the sidelines for now."

Much like Amazon (AMZN) pioneered the era of e-commerce, GrubHub has pioneered the era of online food ordering and delivery. This market has grown by leaps and bounds over the past several years due to secular trends such as the rise of the at-home and gig economies and accelerated digital service adoption. As the market has grown, so has GrubHub, due to the market's relative infancy and lack of viable competitors. Now, competitors are entering the scene. There's data showing that GrubHub is rapidly ceding market share to faster growing yet smaller peers like UberEats, DoorDash, and Postmates. This competition isn't showing up on the revenue line. Last quarter, revenues rose over 50%, active diners rose by nearly 70%, daily average grubs rose by over 35%, and gross food sales rose by 40%. All of those growth rates are in-line or above historical averages. Instead, the competition is showing up on the profit line. Management gave a huge down-guide for fourth quarter EBITDA margins back in October due to increased investment to maximize growth. Specifically, the company is rapidly expanding delivery services to new markets (100 new markets in Q4, versus 100 through the first three quarters of 2018), and significantly upping advertising spend to grow brand awareness.What's going on under the hood? Revenue growth isn't being adversely impacted because, much like the e-commerce industry, the online food ordering space is growing quickly enough and will be big enough to accommodate multiple large and hyper-growth players. The online food delivery market comprises just 5% of addressable restaurant spend. That's a small digital penetration rate. For all retail sales, the digital penetration rate is nearly 10%, while for things like apparel sales, the digital penetration is nearly 30%. Plus, there's the whole international market, which is largely untapped. With such a low global digital penetration rate relative to other industries, the online food delivery market has tremendous growth prospects over the next several years, implying sustained big growth for GrubHub and its competitors alike, much like Amazon, Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Wayfair (W), and Etsy (ETSY) are all still growing side-by-side in the secular growth e-commerce market. In the big picture, secular growth markets can give birth to more than one huge company. AMZN data by YChartsProfit margins, however, are being impacted. GrubHub needs to spend to protect itself from losing too much share, and/or missing a growth opportunity. The company needs to stay on its toes, continue to innovate, and continue to expand. That requires investment, and investment dilutes margins. Thus, diluted margins going forward are the new norm. The bull thesis is two-fold. One, the long term growth drivers underlying GRUB stock remain robust, considering the huge growth potential over the online food ordering industry and GrubHub's market leading position. Over time, market growth will override lower margins, and both revenues and profits will grow by leaps and bounds. Companies that grow revenues and profits by leaps and bounds usually have stocks that rise by leaps and bounds, too. Two, GRUB stock is now rubbing up against price and valuation levels which have historically provided support for the stock, and is bouncing nicely off them, implying that a bottom has been put in. Namely, at its low, GRUB stock dropped ~55% off its recent highs. That almost matches the stock's biggest correction ever, which was back in 2015-16, and was a 60% draw-down from all time highs. The stock nearly hit those levels in late 2018, and has since bounced back. That's bullish price action. GRUB data by YChartsOn the valuation front, GRUB stock hit a low of around 50x trailing earnings in late 2018. That, too, is a level which has historically been a valuation bottom for the stock during multiple selloffs over the past few years. This level should hold again. Revenue growth today is above where it has been historically, and although margins are lower, the long term EPS growth trajectory remains roughly where it's been over the past several years in the 20-30% range. Thus, the fundamentals remain largely the same, implying that the valuation should remain largely the same, too. From this perspective, 50x trailing earnings should be the bottom, and that is roughly where we are today. GRUB PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOverall, the worst may be over for GRUB stock. The long-term growth drivers remain healthy, and the stock has successfully tested and held critical price and valuation support levels. We believe a bottom has been reached, and see this stock bouncing back in a big way from here over the next several months."
4237992,104809,2019-02-05T09:15:00-05:00,"Online food delivery industry is a high growth industry and GrubHub is the best of breed company.However, intense competition from competitors who have or will receive capital injection in the near future means that GrubHub will have to spend more thus face margin contractions.A wait and see approach is best suited to evaluate if GrubHub can defend its market and revenue share while continuing to turn revenue into profits.","GrubHub (GRUB) is a high growth company (as seen in the below graph) in an industry (online food delivery) that has enjoyed significant secular growth in the past years. However, in order to determine if GrubHub can continue to achieve high growth in the future, it's important to understand how big the US food delivery market currently is, how fast the industry can grow in the near future and whether GrubHub can grow at a rate faster than the market and its competitors.Data by YChartsA McKinsey report published in Nov 2018 concludes that the ""market for food delivery stands... (at) 1 percent of the total food market and 4 percent of food sold through restaurants and fast-food chains."" Furthermore, most food deliveries (90%) are placed directly with the restaurant (e.g: ordering pizza directly through Domino's (NYSE:DPZ)) which offers its own delivery service. Of these traditional food deliveries, only 26% are conducted online.Hence, the bull thesis based on the premise that GrubHub and its competitors will be able to convert these traditional methods of food deliveries into its customers as restaurants find it more cost efficient to outsource the logistics of delivery and benefit from GrubHub's large following. This is seen in Morgan Stanley's 2017 report on the food delivery industry which shows that online orders particularly through a delivery service is taking a bigger share of the food delivery market (15% to 18% in a year). This complements the two sources of customer demand driving the food delivery business - food delivery as substitutes for dining at restaurants & substitutes for cooking at home.Source: Morgan Stanley But what exactly is the TAM for the online/mobile app food delivery service business? In its 2015 investment pitch deck, GrubHub claims that the American TAM is $245 billion including delivery & takeout of independent and chain restaurants. Morgan Stanley has a slightly different number.However, the over 200 billion TAM projections (especially the one provided by GrubHub itself) probably include traditional methods of delivery (direct from restaurants) which currently make up around 80% of all food delivery orders. Orders through a delivery service currently make up 18% (up from 15% in one year) of all orders and if one predicts that market share will grow to around 20-25% by 2022, this would be equal to around $45 billion.This is similar to predictions made by Aaron Allen & Associates which predict a 21.7% CAGR with online delivery and takeout predicted to grow to $44.7 billion.Source: Aaron AllenOn the other hand, investment firm Cowen is more optimistic. It is forecasting that the online food delivery industry in the US will grow from to $76 billion in 2022, 12% annually over the next five years.Source: BloombergIf GrubHub manages to maintain its current market share of 34% and if assuming that it continues to earn a 19.5% cut on all orders (calculated by dividing revenue by gross food sales), this would be mean GrubHub earning a revenue of $2.98 billion 2022. This is equivalent to a 198% increase from 2018 sales projection of 982 million. Clearly, the online food delivery industry is in an exciting stage of high growth but the more important question is whether GrubHub will be able to maintain its current market share and commission.With a first mover's advantage over its competitors, GrubHub has managed to establish a market leading position in the industry at 34.4%. While some analysts have said that it's a rather fragmented industry, the top 5 companies have a 95.6% market share.Source: Edison Trends However, it is incredibly worrying that GrubHub's market share has fallen from around 41-42% at the start of Jan 2018 to 34% in Jul 2018! It is facing stiff competition from Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER) as well as DoorDash (DOORD) which has seen significant growth in market share in 1H 18. Given this worrying trend, I would not be surprised to find GrubHub's market share to be even lower towards the end of 2018.Source: Edison TrendsThe below graph of the breakdown of market share in 2017 shows just how quickly GrubHub has lost much of its substantial lead on Uber Eats in little less than a year.Source: BloombergHere are what some of GrubHub's competitors are doing or planning to do to increase their market share:Uber Eats Earlier in Oct 2018, Uber Eats announced that it would expand and by year-end cover 70% of the US population, thus doubling the number of cities that it operates in. Its expansion will allow it to expand to smaller cities and the suburbs.Furthermore it has sought to increase its popularity among consumers in the US by partnering with popular chain restaurants that consumers like. For example, it announced an exclusive partnership with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Popeye's, Subway and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). This has allowed Uber Eats to grow at over 200% (according to its CEO) and has a total gross bookings worth over $6 billion worldwide as compared to GrubHub's $3.7 billion. It was also announced in Apr 2018 that Uber Eats now owns a greater market share than GrubHub in 15 major cities as it ramps up spending.Source: Second MeasureUber Eats also appears to be a stickier service than GrubHub and its other competitors. It has an industry-leading retention rate of 41% where 41% of its customers use the app again within 6 months. This is a great number especially when compared to GrubHub's meager 17% retention rate.Source: Second MeasureAmazingly, its huge growth has been done very organically especially as compared to GrubHub. While GrubHub has made 12 acquisitions since 2011, Uber Eats has only made one acquisition since 2014. Despite this, Uber Eats has enjoyed far higher growth. Its recent acquisition in Jan of 2018 has led to speculation that Uber Eats would adjust its growth strategy to be more in line with GrubHub especially after its 2019 IPO which will provide it with more capital to make such acquisitions and continue its high growth strategy.Postmates and DoorDash Besides Uber Eats, the other online delivery app that has enjoyed some of the highest level of growth in 1H of 2018 is Postmates (POSTM). Postmates and Doordash have created an intense rivalry as challengers to GrubHub and Uber Eats.Postmates is currently valued at $1.85 billion and has introduced a robot delivery service called Serve which will be rolled out in several cities to help make the last mile delivery. Doordash was valued at $4 billion in August 2018, nearly tripling in value a few months after its $1.4 billion valuation in March 2018.Source: Fortune It has also managed to secure several big name partners. For example, in 2018, it added Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) to its list of partners. This is similar to Doordash which has partnered with 50 of the top 100 restaurant chains in the US including Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) and The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE).Source: RecodeMore interesting are the persistent rumours of a merger between DoorDash and Postmates that will provide it with the scale to compete with Uber Eats and GrubHub. However, talks have stalled and Postmates has hinted at a 2019 IPO thus providing it with more capital to take on its bigger rivals.GrubHub's strategy GrubHub has fuelled its growth through two main ways - acquisition and exclusive partnership with chain restaurants.Among its more notable acquisitions include Tapingo which focuses on food delivery on college campuses (can be found in more than 200 campuses), Eat24 which was Yelp's food delivery service and Seamless, a food delivery service that it merged with earlier in 2013.GrubHub has also consistently tried to forge new partnerships with popular chain restaurants. Among its more successful attempts are its recent partnership with Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) where GrubHub will delivery for Taco Bell and KFC. However, I also believe that a great value proposition for users to try services such as GrubHub is to try and discover new food hence the importance of onboarding non-chain and independent restaurants. Here are some examples of great independent restaurants that can be found on GrubHub.While GrubHub may not be growing as quickly as its competitors, its two-prong strategy has allowed it to enjoy significant growth. For example, its number of active users have grown significantly from 0.69 million to 14.46 million in 2017 and its most recent number of 16.38 million (Q3 18) with over 400,000 orders placed daily.Source: Statista According to Second Measure, GrubHub's customers are among the most frequent users of online delivery. ""In the first 10 weeks of this year, 17 percent of GrubHub’s customers ordered food at least once a week, on average. And over 2 percent of its customers placed orders an average of three times per week or more. At Uber Eats, that number was only 1 percent.""Besides possessing a first mover's advantage, I believe that recent events show that GrubHub does not possess any particularly durable or significant moat. It is seeing its market share dwindle rapidly as Uber Eats and Postmates see rapid growth. Furthermore, its user metrics are also inferior when compared to its competitors (with the exception of attracting frequent users). Instead, I see GrubHub's only exemplary feature being its ability to turn a profit (as seen in the below chart).Data by YChartsThis is in stark contrast to its competitors worldwide. For example, despite enjoying more than 85% revenue growth in 2017, Postmates saw an operating loss of 75 million from a revenue of around $250 million while Doordash also indicated to CNBC in Aug 2018 that it was yet to be profitable. This is similar to the online delivery market in the rest of the world. Takeaway.com (OTCPK:TKAYF) (market leader in several European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands) posted a 1H 18 loss of around 14.7 million euros as compared to a 110 million euros revenue.Deliveroo, another online food delivery giant saw pre-tax losses balloon to 184.7 million pounds with a 2017 revenue of 277 million pounds. This is the same in China where Ele.me, Didi and Meituan are all operating loss-making businesses in online delivery. Hence, I find GrubHub's consistent ability to convert revenue into net profit quite incredible in such a cut-throat industry.However, I believe that given the increasing competition in the US market as well as the projected increased capital injection into many of GrubHub's competitors in 2019, GrubHub will have to spend more than it did in order to even maintain its current market share.Margin contraction as a result of increased expenses were mentioned by management which projected a $10 million increase in expenses to expand driver capacities in new markets. GrubHub is also projecting for increased spending (increase in $10-20 million) in marketing which includes incremental discount offers. This has led management to re-guide Q4 EBITDA to about $40-50 million ($25 million less than initial guidance).One of my greatest fears for the online food delivery business in the US is that it might spiral into a full-out price war. GrubHub's management has already hinted that it would provide ""incremental discount offers"" when explaining the increase in marketing costs. The perfect example is China where competition is so fierce that companies are offering massive discounts in order to increase its market share. As can be seen below, a meal ordered on the Meituan app would cost 32.5 RMB but after discounts provided by Meituan, the user only had to pay 1 cent. This is a concern reflected by management in its recent Q3 earnings callSource: The QuartzGiven its continued high growth, ability to turn a profit and market-leading position in an industry that has many secular growth drivers, there is no doubt that despite increasing competition, GrubHub is a good company. However, where the problem often lies is the valuation of a company with no considerable moat and competitive advantage. This is reflected in the Barron's article, "" GrubHub: A Good Company at the Wrong Price.""GrubHub currently trades at a P/S ratio of 7.9 which is neither historically high nor particularly low. It is also around the middle of the pack when compared to other publicly listed food delivery companies as shown below.Data by YChartsHowever, how does GrubHub's valuation compare to its US peers. According to Edison Trends, GrubHub's 1H 18 revenue was $472.3 million giving it a 34.4% revenue share in the US. This would imply that Uber Eats with 27.9% of revenue share had a revenue of $383 million, DoorDash with $245.76 million and Postmates with $162 million.Based on 1H growth, I extrapolate 2018 revenue to be around $1 billion for GrubHub, $589.8 million for Doordash and $364 million for Postmates. This translates to the following P/S Ratio.Hence, as can be seen, GrubHub is valued at a slight premium to Doordash despite Doordash being the fastest growing online food delivery company in the US. Some may argue that its premium valuation can be explained by its ability to make profits but future margin contraction is definitely a huge worry. In a year Q3 operating margin contracted from 10% to 8.8%. The uncertainty around future expenses and hence margins makes it less useful to conduct a DCF.While I am bullish on the industry (online food delivery) due to its severe under-penetration and changing habits and tastes of consumers, I believe that the premium valuation placed upon GrubHub makes it overvalued. This is considering the intense competition that has taken a big slice of GrubHub's market share. The recent and future capital injection into its competitors also makes it certain that margin contractions are an inevitable part of its future as it is forced to ramp up spending on marketing (and discount offerings) as well as operational expenses in order to enter new markets.Hence, I am prepared to take a wait and see approach and re-evaluate GrubHub's operational metrics in the upcoming quarters. If GrubHub's stock price falls to the low $60s, I will be tempted to initiate a position as its P/S ratio will be a far more reasonable 5.1-5.4."
4216718,22148,2018-10-31T19:09:25-04:00,GrubHub has been hit hard by the market sell off and weak EBITDA guidance.The company is now facing cost pressures while needing to ramp marketing spend for new markets.The stock is fairly valued at about 7x '19 sales estimates.,"Over the course of the last year, the market inexplicably pushed GrubHub (GRUB) to nosebleed valuations. After guidance of more spending and the implications of a more competitive market, the stock is likely to struggle even after this more than $50 dip from the highs to $95. My investment thesis has remained neutral on the stock at this level due to cost issues going forward.Image Source: GrubHub websiteIn Q3, GrubHub reported incredible 52% revenue growth and record revenues of $247 million. A key part of the story, though, is that the entry into additional delivery markets automatically expands revenues without necessarily improving the profit picture. Each additional market has its costs and the delivery company is now going into smaller markets.A big part of the story has always been the ability of GrubHub to continue generating solid margins and profits in the face of investing in growth and tough competition. The troubling part of the quarterly report was the substantially weaker Q4 EBITDA guidance.GrubHub forecast that EBITDA would plunge below $50 million after generating more than $57 million Q4. With sales forecast to hit another record approaching $290 million on 40% growth, the market generally expected continued EBITDA expansion.Source: GrubHub Q3'18 earnings releaseLast Q4, GrubHub generated an ~28% EBITDA margin. The forecast for this quarter is an ~1,200 basis point dip to EBITDA margins of ~16%.The company forecast spending an additional $20 to $30 million on marketing spend to capture more growth in the 200 additional delivery markets GrubHub launched in 2018.The biggest story with the stock now is that investors need to forget about where the stock came from. The key is where the stock should trade. At about $95, GrubHub has a market cap of about $9 billion.Guidance has annual revenues at about $1 billion this year and more than $1.3 billion in 2019. The question is how much one wants to pay for a $1 billion revenue stream and the answer probably isn't much above $10 billion. The 2019 P/S multiple isn't likely to top the current levels for a while.Clearly, investors understand that GrubHub needs to spend on growth initiatives and marketing for new markets, but this level of spending will question the valuation. The '18 EBITDA target of ~$240 million places the stock at about 40x updated estimates for the year. In addition, the stock now trades at about 50x '19 EPS estimates of around $2. The market will now question whether GrubHub can grow EBITDA next year. The online food ordering and delivery company was expanding EBITDA at about the rate of revenue growth, but this guidance places a dent in those expectations going forward.UberEats (UBER) continues an aggressive expansion plan for food delivery. The ramifications of the additional marketing spend and cut in EBITDA margins is due to the fears of Uber reaching 70% of the U.S. population by the end of the year.The food-delivery service of Uber has access to drivers that are increasingly a concern for the sector. Remember that GrubHub started as an online food ordering business and is still expanding in the delivery business. The company only recently expanded to markets like Montgomery, AL, and Lincoln, NE. These additional cities have costs while not carrying the sheer revenue opportunities of the major cities.The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub became too successful in a lot of ways. Their success drew in larger players in the general delivery sector like Uber and now GrubHub faces additional cost pressures on multiple fronts.The stock is fairly valued around current levels. A pullback to the $70 level of earlier this year would make us interested in owning this growth story.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

At the end of 2018 it will have about 280 active markets and somewhere between 16.5M and 17.5M monthly active users, or ""active diners."" GrubHub earns money by taking a commission from restaurants on orders placed through its platform. In exchange it provides customers with online ordering and payment, as well as delivery of the food through its network of drivers who are independent contractors.Today, there are numerous private up-start competitors who compete directly or indirectly for consumer dollars delivering either pre-prepared meals or meal preparation kits. Additionally, large players in the consumer goods and services space have taken interest in the online food-delivery market. Competition is driving down margins and driving up the cost of user-acquisition for GrubHub.GrubHub, like other online food-ordering services, benefits the most from partnerships with large restaurateurs' such as Yum Brands. However, it appears that GrubHub has fallen out of favor in recent times with both its existing and potential partners.GrubHub's business model is not unique, and its potential for future international expansion will be limited by copy-cat businesses in populous foreign countries outside of the United States. Its P/E ratio has been exceptionally high, and does not accurately reflect its potential for future growth.GrubHub has recently reported that it will increase sales and marketing spend as competition continues its drag on margins and cost-of-user-acquisition. If this additional spend does not yield a meaningful increase in user acquisitions, it's safe to say GrubHub's ability to grow quickly enough to justify its valuation maybe under pressure.GrubHub maybe an acquisition target in a crowded space, but I have a hard-time identifying potential acquirers given the ubiquity of ""like"" companies with similar technology and far lower valuations.Finally, looking at the quantitative price action in the stock. Since GrubHub's debut in 2014 at $26 a share, it has traded between $18.50 and $148.35 a share, and while 4-years is only a short period of time there are some interesting patterns emerging in its price action.Source: MEME - Google Images (Breaking Bad)I don't have enough fingers and toes to list GrubHub's competitors so let's start a list off the top of my head: Delivery.com, Munchery, Caviar, DoorDash, Postmates, Bite Squad, HelloFresh, Home Chef (the last two are ""Home Meal Kit Delivery"" options, which I tend to consider as proximity competitors).Even if you've heard of half of the names on that short list (all I had to do was google ""Food Delivery Service""), I'd be remiss to assume for every one of them there are 10 more operating in their own market-segments or niches. More warring factions than a Game of Thrones episode.Also notice, that list doesn't include the two competitors I consider to be the most dangerous: UberEats and Amazon Restaurants. Neither of whom can be dismissed as anything less than steam rollers when it comes to business segments/regions they enter. Both are well known users of a ""blitzkreig"" technique of entering business segments/ regions and using their seemingly bottomless investor dollars to win market share and starve out competition.I witnessed this firsthand, while living in San Francisco in 2015, when Amazon laid waste to upstart home grocery delivery service Instacart, with ""Prime Now"" and ""Amazon Fresh"". It's also worth noting that Amazon Prime has 100 million plus members whom are all receiving discount coupons for various Amazon ancillary services (like Prime Restaurants) in exchange for waiting a bit longer to receive their prime orders.Likewise, UberEat's portion of Uber's sure-to-be colossal 2019 IPO certainly cannot be underestimated. As a private company, our understanding of Uber's business segments and their contributions to its overall market valuation and revenues are relatively opaque. Though we've had a few peeks, for example, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi mentioned in May of 2018, that the food delivery service (UberEats) already has a $6 billion run-rate and is growing at 200 percent. As the article rightly points out, that number by itself eclipses GrubHub at $3.8 billion in annual food sales.GrubHub's Q3 '18 conference call was dominated by talk of how much spending the company will have to do going forward to maintain market share. The company state during this conference call that it planned to increase its incremental marketing spend by between $10-$20 million. Taking the middle of that range ($15M) this is about a 31.5% increase over the average quarterly spending in the proceeding 4 quarters ($47.8M). This spend shows up in their EBITA Guidance for Q4 '18, which they cut to $40-$50 million from $72 million. At the high-end this is a ~31% haircut, and this is during the winter months which are ""traditionally their strongest quarter.""Organic user growth is the best kind in my opinion, because it comes for free, and the best way for GrubHub to grow organically is through partnerships with restaurant chains (such as it's relationship with Yum Brands) but this may not be going so well either:I've bolded the ""Taco Bells and KFCs"" reference above because it's notable, in my opinion, that Yum Brand's second largest business Pizza Hut recently announced their acquisition of QuickOrder, despite their 3% ownership in GrubHub. Now, it might be worth considering that the Pizza space is much more technologically competitive than Fried Chicken (KFC) or Mexican (Taco Bell though ""Mexican"" is being generous), with notoriously tech savvy Dominoes. Then again, Pizza Hut has always been conspicuous absent from the Yum Brands partnership.This still begs the question though: Why would Yum Brands pass over GrubHub? Could it be that they feel that an additional investment is over-priced at the current share price?Speaking of partnerships, Starbucks announced in recent weeks that it had chosen UberEats as its primary distribution partner. Imagine the kind of free exposure an UberEats sticker in 2,000 Starbucks across the U.S. will garner.Next, let's look at GrubHub's future potential for growth. Technology companies command their nose-bleed P/Es because of the ""digital potential"" (relative capital investment's return (ROI) on investment for digital goods/services vs. investing a dollar in a business that has fixed margins per dollar of revenue). Technology companies should be able to drive down their margins through digital potential, economies of scale, network effects, et al. However, with GrubHub, in my opinion, there is nothing truly uncopyable about GrubHub's business model. So it's no wonder there are hordes of online delivery services in the two most populous nations in the world: China and India.So, broader-market conditions aside, it begs the question how could this company justify a P/E ratio of 100+ during parts of 2018? We're back down into the mid-50's presently, and even this seems inflated when taken against the Nasdaq 100's P/E of ~18.3.Interestingly GrubHub's P/E Ratio, when the stock made its all-time-high was ~104 and ~114 when it made its all-time-low. Based on current projections it holds a ~59 Forward P/E (1yr) vs. Nasdaq-100's Forward P/E (1yr) of 17.10.Source: Trading View (my own annotations)The 1y-Forward P/E vs. the current P/E is higher for GrubHub than it is for the Nasdaq-100, an indicator to me that the shares maybe mis-priced relative to potential future growth even for a single stock.On a side note, GrubHub's inflated P/E was how I became interested in the GrubHub trade in September 2018, as I felt cyclically some high-flying Nasdaq technology stocks were in for some P/E compression in the latter half of 2018.Source: MEME - Google Images(Hint: Look at October, November, and December 2018 and you can assume how I did.)So far I've mostly speculated about GrubHub's potential market woes, so to put it in some relief, a number I would be watching to further validate my theories about GrubHub's competition and spend would be ""active diners,"" a number that grew ~67% YoY for Q3 '18, to 16.4M.Simplifying the math, that works out to ~6.5M new ""active users"" from Q3 '17 to Q3 '18 During this time, GrubHub reported:*Earnings call transcripts, SEC 10K & 10QWhile these numbers are skewed higher due to the acquisition of ""Eat24"" from Yelp in 2017, and recognizing its contribution to the overall user-base count of active diners (4M) in Q4 '17, the general consensus I am watching for is the net effect of the $10-$20M increase in sales and marketing spend on growth of the GrubHub ""Active Diners"" count in Q4 '18.Excluding the Eat24 bump, over the last year, GrubHub spent an average of $47.3M per quarter on advertising to gain an average of 675K users. If they are increasing their advertising spend by $15M (split the guidance) or ~31% in Q4 '18, I would expect that they should obtain at least 31% more users or around ~884K, adding to a total of 17.28M. Any number less than this and I believe my theory would be validated.If GrubHub adds 884K users in Q4 '18, and spends a total of $61.98M on Sales and Marketing, this would work out to an average of ~$70.11 per average user added. Which is roughly in-line with their average cost of user acquisition ($73.22). Failing to do so, and we can expect cost of user acquisitions to increase in the future.Technology companies grow by acquisitions, and they are definitely the short seller's kryptonite. I'd be remiss if I didn't at least consider who might be in the market for GrubHub at this point and who could swallow a roughly $8 billion price-tag plus premium.Analysts have pointed to the possibility of Amazon acquiring GrubHub before, a little over a year-and-a-half ago a Wedbush Securities analyst, Aaron Turner suggested Amazon might want to buy GrubHub to augment its restaurant delivery business.The next most obvious is their existing partner Yum Brands, though I'm less confident that they are eyeing a meal of GrubHub's size given the recent Pizza Hut-Quick Order tie up.Are there other technology companies who want access to the online delivery space? Lyft and Uber seem to have a ""me too"" thing going on (not #metoo - well, maybe Uber ... but that's beside the point), so I'd be cognizant of this, though I doubt we'd see anything until after the impending Lyft IPO (circa early Q2 '19)?Google has more or less let Google Express drift aloft like the balloon or parachute that is its logo. It strikes me that they have bigger concerns with Amazon's purported entry into the pay-per-click advertising space than with Amazon Restaurants. Google Express may see its days numbered like so many other failed Google experiments.Since GrubHub debut in April '14, it has traded in an all-time range of $17.77 (1/28/16) to $149.34 (9/14/18), and has an all-time average closing price of $51.23, which is first closed above on (8/4/17).In the latter quarter of 2018, we saw the stock make a precipitous retrace from its all time high (September '18) to the end of 2018, the stock fell almost 50%. At which point the price has rebounded since nearly touching its 52-week low.Along with the broader market, I expect the price to rebound off support here before continuing lower based on the factors I have identified above. The next major fibonacci support appears to be around $48.Source: Trading View (My own annotations)Thanks for reading - I would appreciate everyone's feedback (or UberEats restaurant tips)!"
4215742,104761,2018-10-30T09:00:18-04:00,"GrubHub posted another stellar quarter with 37% organic revenue growth in Q3-18. I dipped my toes in after the price fell below $90 and may add more on dips.Shares tanked due to increased costs planned for Q4, which will result in Q4 EBITDA ($40-50 million) that is $25 million lower than originally expected.I couldn't justify paying $140 for GrubHub in September, but shares look like a reasonable growth play below $90 after the Q3 dip. However, the price could fall further.There is plenty of runway for growth in the food delivery market.Competition remains intense and Uber Eats is growing fast, with a recent announcement of 70% U.S. penetration by year-end.","GrubHub (GRUB) has posted another stellar quarter. Q3-18 organic revenue was up 37% and the company continued a track record of beating revenue growth expectations since late 2015. The company also eclipsed earnings expectations and the last time the company didn't do so was Q4-17.Despite the great results and torrid growth rate, the stock has been hammered in wake of Q3-18. The company issued Q4-18 EBITDA guidance that didn't meet consensus due to a higher-than-expected increase in marketing spend in Q4 by $25 million to support growth initiatives.I wrote my initial article about GrubHub in late September, noting the extreme valuation of $140+/share. As of this writing, we're under $90 and there is plenty of runway for growth ahead in a competitive food delivery market. I initiated a position after the selloff on October 25.Though GrubHub is the market leader, competition remains stiff. The Q3-18 report comes on the heels of Uber Eats announcing its intention to reach 70% of U.S. population by the end of 2018.The growth metrics across the board for GrubHub look great. Organic revenue was up 37%. Daily average grubs (DAGs) were up 37%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 41%. Adjusted EBITDA per order was $1.57, up 3% from $1.52 in the prior year.The company has entered 100 new markets through three quarters, already meeting the annual goal of 100 established by the company before the year began. In support of this rapid growth, the company will spend about $10 million (unexpected) in Q4 to help ramp up those new markets. The company will also spend an additional $10-20 million (unexpected) on additional marketing, and spend another $2-3 million (unexpected) on recently acquired LevelUp.Traders punished the stock for the announced increase in Q4 spend. But Maloney's rationale for the investment makes sense. The company is firing on all cylinders and is ramping up spend in new markets to maximize growth. The market is highly competitive and this is about grabbing market share and solidifying a presence in as many markets as possible.There has been wide coverage of the restaurant delivery market. In April, Recode provided a snapshot of the market. GrubHub was the clear dominant player at the time with 50% market share. But the market has evolved rapidly. Just six months prior to the April 2018 article, GrubHub had 60% national market share and proceeded to lose 10% share, though the company continued to grow at a torrid pace. In that same six-month period, Uber Eats doubled its national market share from 10% to 20%.Uber Eats recently announced its intention to be available to 70% of the U.S. population by year-end. Food delivery is a key growth driver for Uber, which has several growth verticals it is pursuing beyond ride share. That said, GrubHub CEO Maloney says he's not worried about competition.Source of above graphic from April 2018: RecodeAnother article published by Second Measure also illustrated how rapidly Uber Eats was growing in the space. Between August 2017 and February 2018, Uber Eats had gained dominant market share in 15 of the 40 largest US cities and had overtaken GrubHub in El Paso, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida. Over the six-month period tracked by Second Measure, Uber Eats crushed the competition in sales growth:Source of above graphic from April 2018: Second MeasureDespite Uber Eats' rapid ascension in the market, GrubHub has proven resilient among customers who order out frequently. But a countervailing statistic showed that Uber Eats had greater success retaining new clients over the six-month period studied by Second Measure.As the GrubHub CEO stated on the Q3-18 call, there is plenty of market opportunity for food delivery. Statista predicts the food delivery market will grow at nearly 10% annually through 2022. With GrubHub and competitors frantically jockeying for leadership positions in major cities, it seems likely that there will be more mergers. GrubHub has acquired several competitors, and GrubHub itself may prove to be an attractive target for a larger company like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It was reported that DoorDash had considered merging with rival PostMates earlier this year in order to compete more effectively compete with GrubHub and Uber Eats.GrubHub eclipsed $140 this year. As of this writing, it's at $84. The early October market selloff shaved about $30 off GrubHub's share price before the Q3-18 call, which led to GrubHub dipping another 10-12% below $100/share before the general market selloff shaved more off the price, leading it to the mid-$80s. I initiated a position at $86. Despite the steep selloff, the company is still up vs. the S&P 500 this year.If the market continues to tank, and GrubHub gets killed, I may add more to my position. Based on a FCF model with 30-year US Treasury discount rate, and 3% perpetuity growth after year 10, and I get a fair value in the high $60s. I use the 30-year as my discount rate. I don't use a risk premium. GrubHub is a growth stock. I think GrubHub is in a great position with several years of strong growth ahead of it. I've dipped my toes in the mid-$80s. If the stock continues to get pummeled in the coming months, I may add to my position.GrubHub is a growth company trading at an attractive price given the runway ahead of it. Uber Eats is a strong competitor and is growing fast. Despite the competition from Uber Eats, Door Dash, and others, the GrubHub CEO is excited about the market opportunity. Additional market corrections could present an even better entry point in the months ahead. We'll see."
4216100,73185,2018-10-30T17:13:44-04:00,"GRUB stock has dropped 40% over the past few weeks due to concerns about margins and competition.The secular growth narrative of GrubHub emerging as a leader in the secular growth online food delivery market remains intact.But GRUB stock needs margin expansion in order to justify even the post sell-off valuation.Margin expansion will likely resume next year, and GRUB stock should consequently rally from here.","Hyper-growth food delivery giant GrubHub (GRUB) has seen its stock drop more than 40% off recent highs due to a double headwind. First, markets entered sell-off mode in October on concerns regarding slowing economic growth, higher rates and rising costs. Second, GrubHub gave a weak fourth quarter guide with respect to margins, and that freaked out investors. All together, GRUB stock has lost 40% of its value in just a few weeks. At these levels, the long-term bull thesis on GRUB stock looks compelling, but it hinges on two things: Margin improvement and subdued competition. If margins bounce back from near-term compression and competition remains a non-factor, GRUB stock will roar higher from here. But if margins remain depressed and competition continues to eat away market share, GRUB stock will have a tough time heading higher even from depressed levels. We have faith that GrubHub can maintain market-leading online food delivery leadership and that new investments will help the company maintain that leadership. We also have faith that margins will rebound in the future thanks to robust revenue growth. As such, we think GRUB stock can rally from here. But we also acknowledge the margin and competition risks, and aren't yet willing to buy the dip with both hands. Instead, this feels like an opportunity to take some nibbles first. GrubHub is the leader in the red-hot online food delivery market which has grown by leaps and bounds over the past several years due to secular trends such as the rise of the at-home and gig economies and accelerated digital service adoption. The combination of these trends has provided a huge tailwind for GrubHub, and the company has consequently sustained large revenue growth over the past several quarters. This large revenue growth isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The online food delivery market comprises just 5% of addressable restaurant spend. That's a small digital penetration rate. For all retail sales, the digital penetration rate is nearly 10%, while for things like apparel sales, the digital penetration is nearly 30%. As such, with such a low digital penetration rate relative to other industries, the online food delivery market has tremendous growth prospects over the next several years. Those huge growth prospects have attracted multiple competitors into this space. While GrubHub has maintained a leadership position in this market despite rising competition, the company is rapidly ceding market share to faster growing yet smaller peers like UberEats, DoorDash, and Postmates.Eventually, this trend of consistent market share erosion will be a problem for GrubHub. But not yet. The online food delivery market is growing so rapidly that even amid market share erosion, GrubHub is growing at an impressive and sustained rate. Last quarter, revenues rose over 50%, active diners rose by nearly 70%, daily average grubs rose by over 35%, and gross food sales rose by 40%. Those huge growth rates are inline with what GrubHub has reported over the past few quarters, so not only is growth big, it's resilient despite market share erosion. Thus, revenue growth isn't the problem at GrubHub. The online food delivery market is growing so rapidly and has so much growth left that it can accommodate multiple hyper-growth players for a lot longer. Instead, the problem is margins. Management gave a huge down-guide for fourth quarter EBITDA margins due to increased investment to maximize growth. Specifically, the company is rapidly expanding delivery services to new markets (100 new markets in Q4, versus 100 through the first three quarters of 2018), and significantly upping advertising spend to grow brand awareness. The sum of these growth investments is expected to weigh significantly on margins in Q4. This down EBITDA guide is largely why GRUB stock fell 40%. A 40% knock-out from a down EBITDA guide for one quarter seems harsh. But investors are worried that the down guide is part of a bigger trend. Namely, management is upping growth-related spend at the same time that competition is aggressively stealing share. In other words, these moves seem defensive, and if they are, higher spend may be the new norm, and lower margins may be here to stay for longer. If so, GRUB stock will have a tough time rallying, even from this depressed base. After all, the forward earnings multiple is still at 50, vs. a market-average forward multiple of under 16. In order to justify that premium, you need not only robust revenue growth, but healthy margin expansion, too. Investors are worried competition will dilute the margin expansion part of the GRUB narrative, and as such, have been selling GRUB stock in bulk. But, realistically speaking, we don't see competition killing GrubHub's margins as the most likely outcome. Margins are being dragged down by two things: Market expansion and increased marketing. Market expansion is a near-term phenomena, and once GrubHub has expanded everywhere, that spend will no longer be in the financials, regardless of competition. Meanwhile, increased marketing will likely persist as competition ramps, but it's very unlikely that marketing spend growth keeps up with revenue growth in the long term. Revenue growth was over 50% last quarter and should remain in excess of 20% considering the online food delivery market's sizable growth prospects. Thus, we have a tough time seeing GrubHub's margins being permanently depressed. Instead, we think Q4 margin compression is just a near-term phenomena which will supercharge growth in a competitive environment, and that over time these expenses will phase out and margins will come roaring back. From this perspective, we think now is a good time to start buying the dip in GRUB stock. You have a secular growth stock with promising long-term growth drivers that has dropped 40% over the past few weeks due to margin concerns which shouldn't hold up for much longer. As such, it looks like a near-term rebound is in the cards."
4221448,104739,2018-11-12T16:43:19-05:00,"With the advent of mobile on-demand services, the online food aggregators have become facilitators of dining transactions.Online delivery platforms have aggregated menus of hundreds of thousands of restaurants in a stand-alone easy-to-access app.Through organic initiatives and a steady acquisition stream, Grubhub has emerged as the leading US delivery platform.","Today online food delivery in the United States has reached around 6% of total restaurant sales. In comparison to other categories, which have experienced significant online penetration growth, there is clear scope for the online food delivery market to expand.U.S. Online Penetration by Category (2017) Source: ForresterThe market opportunity for the aggregators lies not just in restaurants and food away-from-home, rather the entire food market. The business is highly logistics intensive where scale begets scale, similar in part to how Amazon (AMZN) has come to dominate e-commerce. As the aggregator scales, drivers make more money and average cost per delivery declines as a result of rising drop density. This dynamic creates tremendous barriers to entry, which is evident in the more advanced Chinese market. Consider a market as large and dynamic as China and one might expect a proliferation of aggregators. In reality, the market has condensed to two core players – Meituan (3690-HK) and Alibaba (BABA), which control around a 50% market share respectively. Meituan hails from Beijing where their market share is 66%. In China there are some salient differences with the developed western economies. Firstly, pizza delivery, which commands a relatively high share of take-away food does not exist in China. Secondly, the market for ordering and collecting food – ‘click-and-collect’ or ‘call-and-collect’ simply does not exist as it is so cheap to have food delivered in China.In the United States, there are four main players with Grubhub (GRUB) serving as market leader. In tier one cities Grubhub has reached around a 50% market share. The figure is even higher for New York, a mature city, where Grubhub’s share equates to approximately 70%.History: From Idea Inception to IPOMatt Maloney and Mike Evans were developers working at apartments.com focused on adding geo-location services. The duo believed there was scope to adapt the technology to service the restaurant delivery market. Sampling restaurant’s own websites and telephone delivery services, which were often poorly constructed and unreliable, led to the idea of establishing a selection of restaurants online where users could view menus and arrange food delivery. The pair left their jobs in 2004, formed Grubhub and collected hundreds of restaurant menus which were aggregated on their website. They then met with restaurant owners and offered premium placement on the website for $140 for six months. However, there was resistance as to the value proposition and many restaurants had already created their own websites. To overcome such concerns, the duo persuaded the restaurateur to pay 10% commission on orders placed through the website.In the early years the business was bootstrapped and gaining traction in their local Chicago base, the pair targeted the San Francisco market and started a guerrilla marketing campaign. This had the dual effect of putting the business onto the radar screen of venture capital investors and in 2007 a Series A round of $1.1 million was raised. Post-funding the team hired a San Francisco manager who signed up local restaurants. Growth continued and in 2009 a follow-on $2m Series B round was funded. In 2010 Benchmark Capital injected $11 million in a Series C round and a mobile app was launched. Hitherto, all orders were sent to restaurants by fax but this was becoming increasingly problematic as the machines would run out of ink or get clogged up. To resolve the issue, the company built a tablet app for restaurants to confirm and complete orders, message, change menu items based on outstanding stock, discount and adjust serving hours. Today, free tablets are given to restaurants experiencing high volume.Capital raises of $20m and $50m were completed in 2011 to allow the business to scale quickly and by the end of the year revenue reached $60 million on around $500m of orders. In 2012 revenue increased to $82 million as the business began to follow the traditional S-curve path of user adoption. Thereafter, the company made a series of acquisitions to consolidate territories, including platforms such as Seamless, LA Bite and Delivered Dish. In April 2014 the company completed an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. The capital raised was used to further expand the company’s footprint and fund bolt-on acquisitions, which included DiningIn.com in February 2015, Mealport USA in December 2015 and LABite in May 2016.In February 2018 Grubhub signed a distribution agreement with Yum Brands (YUM), citing their scale, technology expertise and geographical reach as unique selling points. Prior to the deal, Grubhub operated in 80 markets across 1,000 cities throughout the United States and will expand by a further 100 markets – more than doubling its geographical coverage as part of the agreement. Moreover, this still leaves around a quarter of the Taco Bell and KFC restaurants outside its reach for now. The Yum partnership does not preclude signing deals with other national restaurant chains.A Customer Focused Food Delivery Business Serving over 415,000 orders per day across 95,000 restaurant partners in over 1,600 cities Grubhub is the largest online take-away food delivery service in the United States with additional presence in London. Grubhub operates a two-sided network – connecting customers with restaurant partners, which comprise independents and leading chains, such as The Cheesecake Factory, KFC, Taco Bell, Buffalo Wild Wings and Maggiano’s. There are approximately 670,000 food service outlets in the United States which implies 12.7% share of restaurant inventory. A team of more than 300 customer care agents in Chicago proactively manages the status of each order to ensure orders are confirmed within five minutes and the food is sent for delivery within twenty minutes of order receipt.GrubHub derives revenue from the following sources:1) Marketplace services - restaurant location and the number of restaurants in the area both impact the amount of commission GrubHub collects per order. Commission ranges from 5% to 15% but according to an article on qz.com, GrubHub charges an average commission of 13.5%.2) Delivery – GrubHub fulfils orders to the home for an additional 10% cut per order, bringing the total revenue share on average to 23.5%.3) Marketing - GrubHub offers marketing and advertising for restaurants at an extra cost. Restaurants can be listed at the top of the app’s search results for a limited time. In a New York City neighbourhood densely populated with restaurants, the lowest commission for a sponsored listing could be as high as 20% excluding delivery services.In assuming control of the transaction, Grubhub takes ownership of the customer’s data – email, address, demographics, food preferences, order frequency etc. This data is used to improve customer outcomes in areas such as benchmarking, promotions and price optimisation.Grubhub currently runs an ungeared balance sheet with cash and short-term investments broadly equating to gross debt. Management has indicated a willingness to use debt to fund future acquisitions though the firm is unlikely to become highly leveraged.Industry and Competitive EnvironmentBased on forecasts included in the 2013 Euromonitor report, Grubhub believes that Americans spent more than $200 billion on takeout at restaurant chains and independent restaurants in 2015. According to Euromonitor, the delivery market is dominated by four key players – Grubhub (34.4% share), UberEats (27.9%), DoorDash (17.9%) and Post Mates (11.8%). These operators deliver food that is prepared and ready to consume. This should be distinguished from services which deliver food its buyers must cook themselves. According to a survey of 2020 Americans in June 2018 by Finder, the services are used by 45% of Americans with an average spend per user of $63 per month. This equates to a market worth $7 billion a month or $84 billion per annum.Grubhub enjoys strong and sustainable competitive advantages. Firstly, it is unlikely that consumers will add or use more than two food delivery apps on their smartphones. The de facto option in many states across the United States is Grubhub. In the territories in which the company operates, Grubhub has the broadest selection of restaurants, which drives usage. Once the broader logistics infrastructure is in place, restaurants can be added seamlessly. Secondly, as the business scales, delivery drop densities increase such that the average fulfillment cost per delivery declines, underscoring Grubhub as the low cost operator. Thirdly, as selection and density expands in each city, more data on users can be collected which improves the effectiveness of marketing spend and facilitates more targeted promotions. However, these marketing costs are front-end loaded whereas revenue flows over time. Counterintuitively, the lower the reported earnings, the higher the value creation so long as the life-time value of the customer exceeds the cost of customer acquisition. Fourthly, the unsung part of Grubhub’s business is its commitment to customer service and user experience, which has built reputational equity with its customer, acting as a key switching cost.Ignore Near-term Multiples and Focus on Long-Term PenetrationGrubhub’s current PE ratio looks demanding at 50.7x. However, margins are depressed since the company is a) investing to expand restaurant network, which is costly in terms of adding point-of-sale technology; b) integrating acquired company’s systems and infrastructure; c) spending heavily on marketing to attract new users; and d) expanding into new markets, which are inefficient at the outset. Once these markets scale and order volume expands, support costs and delivery costs per order declines over time, improving unit economics.In 2017 revenue expanded by 50%, profits doubled and Grubhub processed $4bn in restaurant food sales. Grubhub’s market capitalisation is $8.3bn versus an addressable market size of $200 billion in 2015, which is thought to be worth $250bn today due to market growth and the expansion of take-out delivery options. If the industry penetration rate were to increase from 6% to 30%, potential gross food sales would equate to $75 billion. If Grubhub were to one day command a 50% market share of online food sales, gross revenue would reach $37.5bn. Assuming a take-rate of 20%, the business could generate net revenue of $7.5bn versus the $687m recorded in FY2017. Given the relatively fixed cost base and operating leverage inherent in the business, operating margins could be in the order of 50%, which implies a net margin of 40%. Therefore, the business could have future earnings power in the order of $3bn. Applying a 15-20x multiple implies an intrinsic value of $45-60bn or 5.7.7.5x upside from the current enterprise value of $7.97bn.SummaryAs a virtual food court with captive audience of millions of consumers, the company has successfully shifted take-out ordering from offline to online and is well placed to benefit from the continued shift to online delivery. There is substantial room to increase adoption by driving awareness, as penetration in established cities like New York currently resides at around 15%. Acquired companies will deliver scale to the business, boosting the platform’s network which serves to deepen the overall competitive moat. The future could bring the advent of dark kitchens, drone delivery and robot chefs, which would bring huge cost advantages to restaurants and open up an even larger addressable market. Given strong industry-wide growth prospects, a consolidating marketplace and a penetration rate which seems certain to rise, shares of Grubhub are recommended for purchase."
4215345,74485,2018-10-29T08:07:41-04:00,"GrubHub reported strong 3Q results, with accelerating top-line growth and a bottom line beat. 4Q investment spending to support accelerating growth opportunities resulted in a substantial disappointment to EBITDA guidance.Shares are down 12% Thursday and over 9% Friday (amidst a broader tech bloodbath), with multiple analysts upgrading shares. Issues appear temporary, and the trend to online restaurant delivery accelerating.We recommended a pair trade with LCA, a SPAC merging with Waitr, last Monday. We believe Waitr will be the best growth story in online restaurant delivery this year.","GrubHub (GRUB) reported Thursday and saw shares decline 12% while LCA/Waitr (LCA) fell 1%. On Friday, GrubHub declined another 9%, while LCA/Waitr fell over 3%. So, currently, the pair-trade we suggested in Monday's article is working - although, the thrust of the article was how much we like LCA/Waitr and its warrants (LCAHW) as a long.That being said, we thought there were a lot of positives from the call that bode well for the future of GrubHub and the online restaurant delivery industry.This view is shared by Goldman Sachs, which added shares to their Conviction Buy List, Wedbush, who named GRUB their “Best Pick” in Restaurants, and DA Davidson and Stifel, who each upgraded shares to Buy from Neutral or Hold ratings. Such a positive sell-side reaction after this type of stock drubbing is atypical, however we agree.We expect that over coming months GRUB likely reverses higher while LCA shares also climb, albeit, at a faster rate.The reason for GRUB's decline was increased marketing spend and roll-outs in 4Q, which will dampen EBITDA by $20-$30mn, although the CFO noted, GRUB should see increased leverage in 1Q19 (they pulled some expansion from 19 into 18). As several sell-side analysts noted, this is a strategy GRUB has pursued in the past, and it worked just as they said it would, rewarding anyone who bought on the dip.The relevant question is whether increased competition is a concern for the LCA/Waitr long thesis. Our contention has been, and remains, that Waitr has SIGNIFICANT white-space for growth and that growing consumer awareness will drive the shift to online ordering, benefiting all players. We believe a quote from GRUB CEO Matt Maloney on the conference call exemplifies this thesis:""We still haven't seen the entry of any competitor impact our growth in any of our markets, and we actually see more opportunity now than ever. I mean, that's part of this investment. It's almost like the classic Starbucks case, where Starbucks comes in and everyone sees more business. It's bringing awareness. I think that we're seeing an accelerated transition from offline to online in our space. I think you're seeing more diners receptive to using their mobile devices to order dinner, and I think everyone is benefiting from that. And that's part of why we're seeing and you asked me about CPAs. We're seeing CPAs decrease overall over the year, which is fantastic. Adam mentioned earlier that we're seeing very stable cohorts, and we're seeing the cost of acquisition decrease. We're seeing the lifetime value overall go up."" (bold added)As we noted in our write-up, we don't see this as a zero-sum game (at least for now), but as a nascent and burgeoning market.GRUB CFO Adam DeWitt added on the call:""And I think it's important to note that we saw that acceleration in all of our markets, right? So whether it's markets that we've been in a long time, like New York or Chicago, markets we've been in a little bit of time, like Dallas or Houston, or markets that we've barely entered, like Portland, Maine. So, we're seeing acceleration across the board. And particularly those newer markets have accelerated even a little bit more than the more mature markets."" (bold added)However, in an effort to be comprehensive, we took a look at Waitr's October 16 press release where they say they are entering 20 new cities and also looked well as their career page where they’re hiring Business Development Managers, City Managers, and other positions - which include 8 states where Waitr currently doesn't have a presence. Of the 35 total new cities we've identified, GrubHub has a minor presence in 8, a medium presence in 2, and no presence in 25 (we manually went to see if GrubHub delivers in all 35, rather than simply look at GrubHub’s page).First mover advantage helps a lot, and it seems like Waitr is locked and loaded on locations where they can quickly become the dominant player in the new geography it enters. However even when Waitr hasn't been first to market, their keen focus has driven them to be the top online provider in that market. The leadership position that Waitr has in virtually all its cities supports this notion.Source: Page23 of LCA/Waitr investor presentationThe bottom line is we believe there is significant runway for multiple players and industry growth is likely to accelerate. Waitr has identified a strong geographic niche and will judiciously, but rapidly, continue to expand into additional “spokes” around their ""hubs.""We expect LCA's next catalyst to be in the next week or so, when they announce an official vote date for the closing of the Waitr transaction, followed by 3Q earnings (expect raised guidance) and transaction close (the latter two could be in either order or concurrent), and then a warrant (LCAHW) tender and/or exchange for stock. We continue to believe LCA offers 50-100% upside over the next 6-12 months, with the potential for a sharp move higher far sooner, assuming a stable broader stock market.Disclaimer: This article was provided for informational purposes only.

4215618,103480,2018-10-29T19:43:27-04:00,"Shares of GrubHub dropped sharply after reporting Q3 results, despite strong results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations on revenue and EPS.The company has fallen a breathtaking 40% from all-time highs, in line with losses of other high-growth, richly valued tech stocks.Primarily at issue is GrubHub's pace of deceleration, especially as newer offerings like UberEats begin to market themselves more aggressively.Still, GrubHub remains the leader in the space, and this year, it has turned impressive revenue growth into meaningful bottom-line expansion as well.","A few short weeks in October have dramatically cut short an impressive rally in GrubHub (GRUB) stock that nearly doubled the company's value in 2018. The food delivery leader just posted Q3 results, and despite notching high marks on all key metrics, the company sank yet another 10% - a sharp reversal from last quarter, where shares of GrubHub soared nearly 20% after the quarterly print. Back then, the stock was too expensive to invest in - now, at more than 40% below its all-time highs, GrubHub has essentially reversed all of its gains for the year and is now at a more reasonable valuation.GRUB data by YChartsInvestors have to ask themselves - has anything at GrubHub fundamentally changed pre-pullback to now, or is it just GrubHub's perception? In my view, it's the latter - the business is humming along on all fronts, as active diners continue an impressive climb despite being already at a considerable size.The only potential roadblock to unfettered enthusiasm for GrubHub is competitive chatter surrounding UberEats. UberEats has been extremely aggressive in pushing into GrubHub's territory, by expanding into suburbs and new urban markets. It's also been very aggressive with partnerships - for example, by announcing inter-operability and a limited-time promo with Venmo. As reported in a Fortune article, an Uber executive was quoted as saying that ""Eats is growing just as fast if not faster"" than UberX. That's a bold statement from a company whose flagship taxi service has taken it to a $120 billion valuation in under 10 years.UberEats is nothing new for GrubHub, however. Competitors have been clawing at its heels for quite a while, and GrubHub has managed to remain in hyper-growth mode despite the rise of peers like Postmates and DoorDash. In addition, GrubHub's Seamless service - which is essentially a delivery service tailored to businesses (used frequently by finance staffers to expense late-night meals), gives it a unique edge in the corporate market that competitors don't yet have easy access to.I didn't like GrubHub when it was trading in the mid-$100s, but now at $88 and below 8x forward revenues for a company that is growing at >50% y/y and also turning a positive profit, it's easy to make a bullish case. This is especially true as GrubHub's guidance for the fourth quarter of $283-293 million continues a strong growth trend and smashes Wall Street expectations of $272 million:Figure 1. GrubHub guidanceSource: GrubHub investor relationsWhile a pullback from $150 was certainly long overdue for GrubHub, the magnitude of the correction now has fallen out of line with the company's fundamental performance. It may take some time for growth stocks to get back on track and reclaim their all-time highs (positive catalysts such as the midterm elections or a thawing of U.S.-China tensions could get us there), but at present, investors should consider nibbling on GrubHub and waiting for a recovery.Here's a look at GrubHub's strong third-quarter results:Figure 2. GrubHub 3Q18 resultsSource: GrubHub investor relationsRevenues grew 52% y/y to $247.2 million, actually accelerating one point over last quarter's revenue growth of 51% y/y. When a company like GrubHub has already hit a ~$1 billion annual revenue run rate, acceleration of any magnitude - especially in the ~50% growth range - is truly remarkable. Note also that even last quarter's revenue growth had been a two-point acceleration over 49% y/y growth in the first quarter. Wall Street had not been expecting such strength in the quarter - consensus had pinned this quarter's revenues at $238.7 million, or 46% y/y growth. While it's true that a lot of this growth has been driven by acquisitions, GrubHub noted that excluding the contributions for eat24 and LevelUp, organic growth from GrubHub would have still been high at 34% y/y.As can also be seen in the chart above, GrubHub grew its active diners by 67% y/y to 16.4 million, adding 800k diners sequentially in what CFO Adam DeWitt called GrubHub's ""strongest quarter ever"" on this quarter's earnings call:Gross food sales, meanwhile, rose 40% y/y to $1.21 billion (23% y/y on an organic basis, and an acceleration from last quarter). While this is still an impressive figure, this pales in comparison to revenue growth and active diner growth - suggesting that GrubHub is finding ways to monetize its platform to grow faster than the increase in food orders.Management also noted that its partnership with Yum is continuing in stride. The company has now launched GrubHub Delivery for Taco Bells and KFCs in more than 100 markets, driving a good portion of the company's active diner growth this quarter.This top-line strength translated into some bottom-line improvement. Operating income grew 28% y/y to $21.8 million, while GrubHub's preferred profit metric, adjusted EBITDA, grew 40% y/y to $60.1 million. In both cases, both measures of profit grew slower than revenues. Adjusted EBITDA margins shrunk to 24.3%, down 190bps from 26.2% in the year-ago quarter.Figure 3. GrubHub EBITDASource: GrubHub investor relationsRather than deduce that the company's increased scale has made it less efficient, however, consider management's explanation: GrubHub recently blitz-launched into many new markets to support the new Yum partnership, which has higher upfront operational costs to get a driver network in place. Per the CFO's comments on the earnings call:Despite slightly disappointing on EBITDA and EBITDA margins, GrubHub's pro forma EPS of $0.45 still beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.41.GrubHub is a fantastic growth stock whose shares have been disproportionately punished in the recent tech downturn. In falling more than 40% from its peak values, GrubHub's revenue multiple has contracted by four turns, now undervaluing a stock with ~50% y/y revenue growth on top of positive EBITDA margins that will improve as new markets begin to mature.While it's true that GrubHub plays in a very crowded market with well-recognized competitors, this competitive landscape is nothing new. GrubHub has long fended off advances from competitors and maintained its diner growth via. a combination of tuck-in acquisitions and organic partnerships like the Yum deal. This is a company with a strong track record for product innovation as well as execution. Stay long and buy the dip."
4195267,103480,2018-08-06T08:59:35-04:00,"GrubHub shares have been on a consistent tear, especially after the company's Q2 earnings print sent the stock flying more than 20%.Revenue growth accelerated and smashed Wall Street's expectations, but profits still remain thin.Investors are buoyed over the company's $390 million cash acquisition of LevelUp, which will further cement its entry into the POS space.This acquisition consumes the majority of GrubHub's firepower, and it will take on additional leverage to pay up.Shares are trading over 11x forward revenues, a breathtaking multiple for a company with limited earnings.","One of the biggest trends that has transpired this earnings season has been a hemorrhaging of key Internet sector growth names. Investors, no longer as blinded by the promise of a fast-growing top line as in the past, have become much more sensitive to high valuations. Even stocks that were previously thought as ""untouchables"" like Netflix (NFLX) have taken a huge beating, down more than 20% from recent peaks.GrubHub, however, has gone the other way. Its most recent Q2 print has taken shares up by an additional 20%, taking the company's year-to-date gains to greater than 75%. And since the prior quarter's earnings release alone, GrubHub is up nearly 30%:GRUB data by YChartsI was bullish on GrubHub last quarter. At the time, shares were trading at just over 9x forward revenues, and as GrubHub was a high-margin, high-growth stock with a consistent stream of recurring revenues with a base for both consumer ordering as well as enterprise catering (through its Seamless subsidiary), I was willing to value GrubHub as on par with other high-growth SaaS names.But anytime a stock rises this sharply in such a short span of time, we must re-evaluate our long thesis. In this case, GrubHub's revenue multiple has soared to an all-time high of 11.2x forward revenues - despite the company's rapid ~50% y/y revenue growth rate, it becomes more and more difficult to justify this sort of valuation. GrubHub is no stranger to earnings volatility - just last quarter, the company fell nearly 10% despite strong growth and beats to both top and bottom-line consensus. In my view, for all richly valued Internet stocks, a Netflix/Facebook-type takedown is a huge upcoming risk. For each of these types of platforms, investors are zeroed in on some sort of user metric - whether that's paying subscribers (Netflix), Monthly/Daily Active Users (Facebook and Twitter (TWTR), or Active Diners (GRUB). Though GrubHub at the moment appears to be trending strongly, there's no warning as to when these metrics might deteriorate. With GrubHub, expectations are already set incredibly high. Even the slightest slip can result in dramatic selloffs. While I retain a constructive opinion on GrubHub as a company and as a product, it's an extremely risky investment at all-time highs and I'm content to lock in my gains up to this point. One of the headlines that has investors excited about GrubHub is its announcement of a $390 million acquisition of LevelUp, a Boston-based startup that specializes in PoS (point of sale) systems for restaurants. Think of LevelUp as a competitor to Square (SQ), with a unique focus on the restaurant space.Entrance into the PoS space is a natural extension for GrubHub, which has already become a critical marketing and delivery partner to tens of thousands of restaurants. Though restaurant margins might suffer, GrubHub is out to gain the maximum wallet share of fees as possible from its restaurant partners. As such, even I'll admit this is an incredibly smart acquisition.But for all the acquisition-fueled growth that GrubHub has been embarking on of late, it may come to a halt because GrubHub's resources are running thin. The company's Q2 balance sheet counts just $482 million of cash and equivalents remaining, as well as $122 million of debt (net cash of $360 million):Figure 1. GrubHub Q2 balance sheetSource: GrubHub investor relationsThis balance sheet is presented before GrubHub pays $390 million (all cash) for LevelUp. The company has noted that it intends to dip into its credit facility and lever up for a portion of this acquisition, but whatever mix of cash and debt GrubHub uses for this acquisition, it will still take its net cash position into the negative. A cursory scan at the company's latest filed 10-Q for the terms of its debt show that the company has up to $225 million available on its current revolver, with the possibility of seeking an additional $150 million of debt capacity. Figure 2. GrubHub credit termsSource: GrubHub Q1 10-QThe key point here: the LevelUp acquisition will consume a good deal of GrubHub's liquidity, and it won't be able to do another acquisition like this in awhile, unless it seeks an additional capital raise. GrubHub's FCF run rate of ~$90 million in the first half of 2018 is a decent source of funds, but not enough to do another LevelUp deal anytime soon.Here's a look at GrubHub's most recent quarterly results:Figure 3. GrubHub Q2 resultsSource: GrubHub investor relationsRevenue growth stole the spotlight, with total revenues climbing 51% y/y to $239.7 million. This was a surprise two-point acceleration over last quarter's 49% y/y revenue growth, and one that Wall Street did not expect: consensus pinned a target of $233.0 million, or 47% y/y growth. However, organic growth, excluding acquisitions, would have been 34% y/y.Diner metrics continued to show strength in the quarter - but as previously mentioned, these user metrics became the chink in the armor for companies like Netflix, and even the smallest of stumbles in the future can lead to outsized effects on the stock price.Figure 4. GrubHub key metricsSource: GrubHub investor relationsTotal active diners (defined as a diner who placed an order in the quarter) rose 35% y/y to 15.6 million, while ""daily average grubs"" or DAGs also rose 35% y/y. Note that 4 million of these active diners were acquired through GrubHub's purchase of Eat24 from Yelp (YELP), which it purchased for $287.5 million. The Eat24 users contributed to nine points of diner growth; without them, growth would have been 26% y/y. As previously noted, after the LevelUp purchase, GrubHub will have limited resources to make another big M&A play to drive growth. Gross food sales - aka, the total dollar volume of orders transacted on the GrubHub platform, rose 39% y/y to $1.22 billion (excluding eat24, 22% y/y). The fact that revenue growth of 51% y/y is growing substantially faster than active diners, DAGs, and gross food sales illustrates an important point: GrubHub is doing a good job at either raising fees, bringing in tertiary sources of revenue (like LevelUp is soon to be), or both. If we calculate a ""take rate"" for GrubHub (revenues divided by gross food sales), this quarter's percentage of 19.6% beats the year-ago quarter's percentage of 18.1% by 150bps. It's not that entire percentage that's being charged to restaurants as fees, of course, as there are additional revenue streams baked in - still, it's a good indicator of how effective GrubHub has become at monetizing its platform.In spite of this, GrubHub has also required massive increases in operating costs to support its growth. This isn't necessarily a bad thing - growth companies, especially those that are well-capitalized, can comfortably run at a loss for years while focusing on growth. I'd argue, however, that with GrubHub's elevated valuation multiple, we should expect to see profits soon. GrubHub won't get a free pass on earnings forever.Most notably, operations and support costs jumped 63% y/y to $102.4 million, consuming 42.7% of GrubHub's revenues - 310bps worse than 39.6% in the year-ago quarter. We'd expect that as GrubHub grew larger, it would be able to achieve efficiencies in its cost structure - but this quarterly print is saying the opposite. The one bright spot in terms of the bottom line is the fact that LevelUp will come attached with minimal losses, whereas most acquisitions of startups typically come with a headwind of margin due to the absorption of their losses. As noted by GrubHub's CFO, Adam DeWitt, on the earnings call:Still, as previously noted, for GrubHub's valuation we'd like to see some progress on earnings. Net income grew by about 2x in the quarter to $30.1 million, but that's still just a net margin of 12.5%. And with the stock trading at a 66x forward P/E, GrubHub's earnings are nowhere near close to supporting its valuation.GRUB PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIt's important to recognize that a lot of GrubHub's growth this year has been due to M&A, particularly the landmark purchase of Eat24. Eat24 contributed more than 15 points of inorganic revenue growth this quarter. With LevelUp and its $30-$40 million of revenue (per management), GrubHub is adding approximately 3-4 more points of growth on its annual revenue run rate of about $1 billion.But the cash spigot isn't endless, and after the LevelUp deal closes, GrubHub's liquidity will be stretched. It's fortunate that the company has decent FCF generation to support its M&A ambitions, but another mega-deal like LevelUp isn't likely to happen without a capital raise within the next year. If GrubHub slows down its pace of acquisitions, its growth comps could start looking a lot worse with deceleration coming into play - and suddenly, investors could shy away from paying 11x forward revenues for the stock.Make no mistake - GrubHub is still a fantastic company, and the fact that it has transformed itself from a food ordering app to a profitable, fast-growing powerhouse that has become institutionalized within the restaurant industry is a true feat. But at its current market cap, it's also worth the same amount as companies like Macy's (M) and Viacom (VIAB) - companies with far greater earnings power. With the recent hint that investors might be gravitating toward value stocks versus growth, it's a good time to cash out of the GrubHub trade."
4169375,73185,2018-05-03T14:02:03-04:00,"GRUB reported robust Q1 numbers.But GRUB stock dropped in response.The company's underlying growth drivers are strong and have longevity.The stock is just too pricey at current levels.We peg fair value at $90, and believe that this stock won't take a material leg higher until fundamentals catch up to price.","Digital food ordering and delivery platform GrubHub (GRUB) recently reported robust first quarter numbers that were well above expectations. The guide also was strong, and came in largely above consensus estimates. Despite the big beat-and-raise quarter, GRUB stock dropped more than 8% in response. While the stock has rebounded some since, we believe the 8% drop in GRUB stock following robust results should not be ignored. We view this drop as a sure-fire sign that the stock is overvalued at the moment, and believe that while the underlying secular growth story will power the stock higher in a multi-year window, the stock will be turbulent in the near term as the price tag waits for fundamentals to catch up.GRUB data by YChartsBy every measure, GRUB's first quarter earnings report was sensational. The most impressive aspect of the report was that growth simply refuses to slow down despite increasing scale. Revenue growth was 49% in the first quarter, the same as last quarter. Active Diner growth remained above 70%. Daily Average Grubs (DAGs) growth accelerated from 34% to 35%. Gross Food Sales growth remained constant at 39%.That's impressive. Law of large numbers says that as you grow, your growth rates should come down. But that hasn't been the case for GRUB, mostly because the company is rapidly expanding its entire ecosystem. Not only is the company more than doubling the size of its market opportunity (from 80 markets at the end of 2017 to 180 and up in 2018), but GRUB also continues to add new restaurants (Five Guys) and payment capabilities (Venmo). The sum of these expansion initiatives results in sustained large revenue growth.This sustained large revenue growth also speaks to the strength of the underlying at-home economy narrative wherein consumers are doing everything at home. A big part of this transition is going from eating out to ordering food in and having it delivered to your door. From this perspective, GRUB's market opportunity will only keep growing, ensuring that growth rates will remain large for the next several years.But GRUB does have a lot of competition. Although the company isn't rubbing elbows with competitors just yet because revenues are under $1 billion and the market opportunity is growing immensely, it is only a matter of time before competition does become a factor. At that point in time, investors will start paying closer attention to the fact that GRUB is rapidly losing market share to Uber Eats because it will show up in the form of slower-than-expected revenue growth rates.(Source: Recode)When it comes to specific valuation on GRUB, we think the stock is slightly ahead of fundamentals currently. With GRUB, we think it is appropriate to use a 10-year model since the company is so small and growing so quickly (a five-year model simply wouldn't be appropriate).With revenue growth running around 50% right now, we believe that a 20% revenue growth rate over the next 10 years is the most likely outcome. That reflects optimism regarding market opportunity growth, but also pessimism regarding elevated competition as the market grows and as GRUB grows. That would put revenues at $4.22 billion in 10 years.Pre-tax margins were roughly 13% last year. Margins won't zoom higher in the near-term because the company is investing big in order to grow big, which is a perfectly fine and healthy strategy. Over time, though, growth and investment spend will moderate, and margins will zoom higher thanks to robust operating leverage. As such, we feel that 35% pre-tax profit margins in 10 years is the most likely outcome. That would put operating profits at $1.48 billion in 10 years.Taking out 28% for taxes and dividing by a presumably higher share count of 100 million, that equates to roughly $10.65 in earnings per share in 10 years. On average, growth stocks trade around 20-times forward earnings. A growth-average 20-times forward multiple on those $10.65 earnings implies a nine-year forward price target of roughly $213. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a present value of roughly $90.In totality, we think that while strengthening fundamentals and secular tailwinds in delivery will propel results over the next 5-10 years, we also feel that GRUB stock has temporarily sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the near term. Trade will be choppy in the near future, but eventually, a buying opportunity will present itself for long-term investors."
4196106,86776,2018-08-07T20:09:03-04:00,The real play for GrubHub is to emerge as the leading aggregator for food ordering across all channels through which consumers might like to interact with eating establishments.And to become the mobile payments platform that powers it across all those channels for those restaurants.GrubHub today has an $11 billion market cap with 15.4 million active diners on its platforms - 70% more than this time last year and 125 chains from which those diners can order.,"GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) made news a couple weeks ago when it simultaneously delivered a very strong Q2 2018 earnings report and announced the acquisition of LevelUp.The focus then and the subsequent coverage since have been on the positive impact of the LevelUp acquisition on GrubHub's ability to diversify its platform offerings.With LevelUp, GrubHub can now offer restaurants that are part of its network order ahead/pickup in-store and new CRM/loyalty initiatives to their mobile wallets using LevelUp's white-label tech.As for GrubHub's core business of online order and delivery, LevelUp's integrations to most of the cloud-based point-of-sale (POS) systems that power quick-service restaurants (QSRs), including many of the leading players - Toast, ShopKeep, NCR, Clover, Revel, Oracle/MICROS - will undoubtedly help GrubHub's migration from tablets on counters to features inside those cloud-based POS systems.All great synergies, but perhaps not the biggest part of the story.The real play now for GrubHub, with LevelUp, is to emerge as the leading aggregator for food ordering across all of the channels through which consumers might like to interact with those eating establishments: online order and delivery, online ordering for pickup and maybe even, down the road, online ordering of a place in line at fast-casual, sit-down restaurants.And to become the mobile payments platform that powers it across all those channels for those restaurants, supported by a platform-based loyalty play that keeps restaurants and consumers interested and sticky.When asked, mobile payments as an aspect of the acquisition was downplayed on the GrubHub earnings call. My bet is that it will become an incredibly powerful pillar in GrubHub's evolution as a pre-eminent restaurant ordering platform.Remember, before GrubHub bought LevelUp, Chase put a few tens of millions into them as the technology partner that would ignite Chase Pay acceptance at QSRs.LevelUp is front and center on the Chase site as its partner for online ordering using Chase Pay and Chase Commerce Solutions (aka Chase Paymentech). It's where I grabbed this image, in fact.Chase Commerce Solutions is the third-largest merchant services company in the U.S.And before there was Chase, there was LevelUp, the branded mobile payments platform that used those same cube-shaped readers to enable QR code payments at the physical POS for consumers with the LevelUp app. The uniqueness of the LevelUp app was the loyalty component that tracked consumer spend across all restaurants and rewarded users with cash back when spending thresholds were met.The silent player in all of this news is Chase and the role it could have in powering what could become one of the most interesting and disruptive plays the restaurant POS space has seen.The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Restaurants.To understand why I think this way requires a reflection on the evolution of GrubHub over the years.GrubHub founders Matt Maloney and Mike Evans wanted to solve a simple problem in 2004: Make it easy for consumers to order food from local restaurants and have it delivered.At that time, ordering food for delivery was hit or miss - mostly miss.Not every restaurant had a website - most didn't back then, and those that did were hard to navigate, and most didn't keep their menus up to date. Just like in the days before OpenTable aggregated available restaurant inventory and enabled online reservations, consumers dialed for delivery from the places in their 'hood they knew delivered food and hoped they didn't get a busy signal.Building a site to aggregate restaurant menus that would give consumers one place to find restaurants that could deliver food and then place an online order for delivery seemed like a no-brainer. It also was something Maloney and Evans felt restaurants would value enough to pay a subscription fee to be a part of.They didn't.So, they didn't.GrubHub's value to those restaurants changed when GrubHub's business model changed. Instead of charging restaurants to be featured on a site that may or may not drive traffic to them, GrubHub began charging restaurants a percent of the orders they generated. That shifted the burden to GrubHub to be an effective lead gen platform for restaurants and to be rewarded when an order was converted to a sale.That model - aggregating menus from local restaurants in one place and enabling easy online ordering from that online platform - remained GrubHub's mainstay over the next decade.Over that time, GrubHub grew both organically - market by market - as well as through a series of acquisitions to gather more hyperlocal restaurant inventory for their platform. Back then, consumers ordered online from GrubHub, but their favorite restaurant showed up with the order. GrubHub was the enabler and got a commission on every order that originated from its platform.In 2015, GrubHub extended its model and stepped into the delivery business, first through the acquisitions of local platforms that both enabled online ordering and offered delivery services and later through the expansion of its own delivery capabilities - recruiting drivers and building out tools to support the delivery side of its business.In February of 2018, Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) made a $200 million investment in GrubHub, in part, to accelerate the build-out of its delivery platform and to create more favorable delivery economics for its restaurant brands.It made perfect sense.Making great food and delivering great food requires two distinct skill sets with radically different cost structures and customer service requirements, particularly as online ordering volume grows.For GrubHub, taking on the logistics of delivery for local restaurants left restaurants to do what they do best - make great food - while leaving the mechanics of the order-to-delivery process to a platform that was engineered to do what it does best: Optimize the online customer journey and the economics of delivery across all the restaurants served in those local markets.GrubHub claims that restaurants that use GrubHub delivery services generally see a monthly increase in takeout revenue of 30 percent as a result of having more exposure to consumers on its platform and the ability to support more delivery volume. GrubHub also reported that in Q2 of 2018, the average order size was up 3 percent: People find it easier to add to their order when they are looking at a menu online, instead of standing in a line or from memory.Not all restaurants have bought in, including, reportedly, some of the Yum Brands franchisees who are now being asked to get on board the GrubHub delivery platform.Some restaurant operators believe GrubHub as an end-to-end online ordering and delivery platform has changed the relationship dynamics between their establishments and their customers - and not always for the better.Consumers go to GrubHub to order from Joe's Burgers. They pay for that order via GrubHub. They get their food delivered by a guy wearing a GrubHub shirt carrying the Joe's Burgers order inside a GrubHub bag. If that burger arrives cold or soggy because the driver got lost or was late to pick it up, Joe's takes the heat.Now, maybe Joe's would have gotten that heat anyway if it were up to them to handle the delivery. Or maybe Joe's might not have ever gotten the order but for GrubHub's ability to have Joe's as part of its platform for millions of consumers to see and order from.Regardless, some restaurants now view GrubHub as very different from the helpful online aggregator that drove volume their way, that also put them in control of managing those orders and then delivering them to their customers.GrubHub may be the big dog in the online ordering/delivery space, but it's a space with a lot of room to grow.GrubHub's CFO said during its last earnings call that the delivery business is worth roughly $200 billion in the U.S., with online orders maybe reaching $20 billion, or 10 percent. That means 90 percent of restaurant orders are still placed in a physical establishment, and nearly half, 46 percent, of all orders for delivery are still phoned into the restaurant.But like the shift from physical to online retail, online ordering is a space that's growing rapidly, driven by the consumer's desire for convenience - regardless of whether that online order is delivered or picked up and taken out of the restaurant to eat somewhere else.Technomic reports that 86 percent of consumers order online for delivery or pickup at least once a month, with a third of those consumers saying that's more than they did a year ago. The delivery side of that equation is expected to grow double-digits over the coming five years, they also say, fueled by those Bridge Millennials who will soon start families and turn to online order and delivery to minimize the friction associated with cooking at home and to maximize the opportunity to still eat at home.And, as GrubHub's data shows, all with the potential for an incremental lift in the value of those online orders and that digital consumer.GrubHub today has an $11 billion market cap with 15.4 million active diners on its platforms - 70 percent more than this time last year and 125 chains from which those diners can order. Those diners place 423,000 orders a day for delivery. GrubHub also is now integrated into Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) platform, which gives Yelp users the chance to order from GrubHub's network without leaving the Yelp platform. To that, LevelUp adds 100,000 daily orders for pickup and 200 live establishments.GrubHub also is the online ordering and delivery engine for restaurants that aren't really restaurants as we think of them today.Ghost kitchens that prepare food for delivery only have struck exclusive partnerships with GrubHub for delivery in key cities. Those restaurants appear as options when consumers search for a particular type of cuisine and may even include an incentive on the first order to try it. Consumers don't know it isn't a restaurant they can eat in or even order and pick up from, and if the food is great and delivery their MO, they probably won't care.This new restaurant paradigm is catching on as consumers' penchant for delivery and convenience is increasing as quickly as the costs of operating a restaurant are.Ninety percent of food orders may still be placed in the physical store, but only 10 percent of them are eaten there. QSRs, in particular, pay a premium for space and staff that the vast majority of consumers don't use for storefronts in prime locations that carry higher rents.Green Summit operates several such virtual restaurants in New York and Chicago, and GrubHub competitor DoorDash is opening its own virtual kitchens to give restaurant operators a more economical onramp to opening a restaurant in big cities.If any - or all of this - sounds somewhat familiar as a platform storyline, perhaps it is because it is.Amazon started out as an online bookseller that aggregated book titles, later CDs, and made it easy for consumers to go to one place, browse, order and pay for those items online - and have them delivered.That strategy allowed Amazon to build a critical mass of consumers and more inventory for books and music and then lots of other things too that got their own flywheel going.Those lots of other things were courtesy of third-party sellers, which ignited Amazon as a true marketplace and now accounts for more than 50% of the items sold on the Amazon platform. Those sellers have a love/hate relationship with Amazon: They love the sales but don't always like playing second fiddle to the Amazon brand.Amazon's private label brands also captured huge share, first in important categories like batteries and diapers and later in apparel and accessories. With the acquisition of Whole Foods with its own 360 private label brand, private label sales on Amazon will only continue to grow.Those private label sales happen right alongside brands, including via branded Dash buttons: Consumers search for those Dash buttons, allowing them to subscribe to their favorite branded products and be replenished regularly.Prime membership is the fuel that now feeds this Amazon engine and now offers consumers a variety of benefits that extend well beyond free shipping, which remains the core of the Amazon value proposition. Amazon Prime member spend is twice that of non-Prime members, and there's little evidence so far to support significant Prime defections since its $20 price increase.Partly, Amazon Prime members now have a lot more things that come bundled with that Prime membership. Prime members get discounts at Whole Foods and free two-hour delivery, discounts on car rentals through Avis, a free subscription to The Washington Post, free Kindle books, free access to the Amazon-branded suite of baby products and access to Alexa and her growing set of skills and streaming video and music.All, of course, tied to its online mobile payments platform, Amazon Pay, and made even sweeter for those with an Amazon Prime Chase Rewards card linked to it, which offers 5 percent cash back on Amazon purchases, including now at Whole Foods.Which brings me full circle to GrubHub, LevelUp, Chase and the Amazon of Restaurants.The one place Amazon hasn't made much real traction, yet, is online ordering and delivery for restaurants.Yes, there is Amazon Pay Places and Amazon Restaurant, but both lack much local density outside a few deals with a few larger chains in a few big cities.That's because a restaurant is a hyperlocal business, and there are thousands of small local establishments to get on board with which to integrate POS systems. GrubHub, LevelUp and its Chase connection could power the Amazon of Restaurants.This trifecta - with the two-sided network GrubHub has become - has the ability to get restaurants on board and give them a fully integrated POS experience, complete with a fully integrated suite of online ordering solutions.There's the opportunity, leveraging LevelUp's white-label tech, to make the branded mobile wallets of individual restaurants more robust and complete with those capabilities, including the ability to tailor localized offers and promotions to users.Of course, this mobile wallet tech also is certain to introduce new features into the GrubHub mobile app, including tracking of individual orders and preferences for recommendations across the GrubHub network, as well as for those that users like and visit frequently - opening up new revenue opportunities for GrubHub and marketing partnerships for brands to influence consumer spend on those orders.All perhaps sweetened along the way with a GrubHub network-wide loyalty program to keep restaurants and consumers sticky, powered by a mobile payments platform in very much the same way that Amazon Prime member benefits are linked to Amazon Pay. Chase Pay anyone?It maybe not as crazy as it sounds, particularly given Chase Pay's interest and investments in the restaurant dining space.And particularly the group of players that all seem aligned around the GrubHub brand to drive innovation in the space - traditional players like Yum Brands, online aggregators like Yelp, emerging disruptors like Green Summit and financial services players like Chase with 93 million cardholders and the incentive on the part of the Chase team to ignite Chase Pay as a mobile payments platform.Whether it's GrubHub that will emerge as the Amazon of Restaurant Ordering or Amazon or another player, it's a space worth claiming - and a space that will be interesting to watch over the next several years.What I've laid out here is the product of my own independent thinking based on my own brainstorming with me, myself and I on how this incredibly dynamic restaurant ordering space could evolve.Because if I had any insight from any of the players mentioned or knew for sure, you'd have just finished reading a takedown of the Starbucks/bitcoin (NASDAQ:SBUX) deal.For that, there's always next week."

The scale of the company’s restaurant discovery and food delivery marketplace is making it almost a utility play much like WhatsApp. GRUB’s sustained market leadership, economics and scalability make it a good portfolio bet.The increase in the GRUB’s active diner (or user) count, orders and gross food sales have led to an interesting mix of metrics. While the value of each order (value per grub) has been increasing, the average dollar spent by diners (AVOPD) has seen a significant decline.Source: GRUB Financial Model; Note: The GRUB Financial Model has been built by the author using SEC filings, management commentary and competitor analysisThe value/grub essentially refers to the average order value on GRUB's platform. This number has been steadily increasing on the back of inflation and increasing consumption per capita.AVOPD is the money spent by an individual diner. As an example, suppose a diner placed 3 orders of $30 each during one quarter. This would make the value/grub 30 and AVOPD 90 (3x30).The decline in AVOPD, despite an increase in order value, is due to a fall in the number of average orders per diner. The growing number of choices for the diners are likely to lead to a decline in the number of orders made on any one platform.Source: GRUB Financial ModelGRUB’s ability to upsell paid listings and delivery has allowed for the revenue margin to expand, which has offset the impact of a decline in order metrics. On a net basis, the adjusted EBITDA per diner has been quite stable.Source: GRUB Financial ModelGRUB charges a base rate (minimum commission rate) for non-sponsored listings and a fixed ~10% commission for delivery. Sponsored listings attract a higher commission. The commission rates increase based on a restaurant’s desire to appear ahead of competitors. Thus, as more restaurants join GRUB, the need to differentiate will lead to higher commission rates on listings. To increase its restaurant footprint and thus effectively its commission rates, GRUB has tied up with Yum Brands (YUM) and with LevelUp to also enhance integrations with restaurants.On Feb. 8, 2018, YUM and GRUB announced that the two companies would be entering a partnership. As per the scheme, GRUB would become the exclusive online ordering platform for pickup and delivery to YUM’s KFC and Taco Bell brands in the US. Additionally, YUM would invest $200 million in GRUB to help accelerate this rollout. GRUB will also partner with Pizza Hut’s delivery ecosystem to achieve greater reach.EBITDA per order from the YUM deal is expected to be at the same levels as that of GRUB’s existing orders. The company plans to cover two-thirds of YUM’s US restaurants by the end of the calendar year 2018. At the end of 2Q18, in the US, YUM had a total of 10,546 restaurants between KFC and Taco Bell. At the end of 2Q18, GRUB had 85,000 restaurants on its platform with relationships with 125 brands.During GRUB’s 2Q18 earnings call, the management had announced the proposed acquisition of LevelUp.Source: GRUB press release LevelUp sells white-label solutions for order management. It has over 200 restaurant brands as customers. All of the ~100,000 daily orders per day routed through LevelUp's platform are pickup only. The annual gross value of these orders is $400 million and the company does revenues of $30-40 million annually, closing in on a breakeven. GRUB expects to pay $390 million in cash for the deal and expects to generate synergies through:Despite LevelUp’s reach, the economics of LevelUp’s order flow is very different from that of GRUB's.Source: GRUB Financial ModelSource: GRUB Financial ModelGRUB’s initial focus is likely to be on subsuming LevelUp’s technology stack within its own platform, which would help further expansion of the revenue margin. The trickier part could be aligning financials.Source: GRUB Financial ModelGRUB’s TTM gross food sales is over 11x of that on the LevelUp network, with over 4x higher daily average orders. This translates into a ~3x differential in value/order.At a revenue/order level, GRUB earns 6x of what LevelUp does. Thus, given GRUB earns $1.6 per order as EBITDA, migrating LevelUp’s erstwhile orders will be EBITDA negative for GRUB. Instead, GRUB would want to scale up the restaurants on LevelUp.Source: GRUB WebsiteUsing GRUB’s scale-up model and applying GRUB’s expected total commission rate on LevelUp’s business, the ramp up is likely to take 7-8 years!Source: GRUB Financial ModelEven after 7 years, GRUB's revenue per order (from LevelUp's restaurants) will reach to the level of GRUB's revenue per order today! The LevelUp acquisition is more of a horizontal play. Unless GRUB management is willing to sacrifice margins in the short term, the LevelUp acquisition should be aimed at increasing order value for existing customers.The growth in diners and revenue margin is likely to get reflected in both revenue and EBITDA.Source: GRUB Financial ModelThe focus on delivery and incremental services is likely to also ensure stable cash flow growth. Following is a summary of the key assumptions used in the GRUB Financial Model.Source: GRUB Financial ModelThe major differences across the three scenarios are the velocity of diner acquisition, the velocity of onboarding restaurants and associated network effects. Due to the non-linear nature of GRUB’s revenue vs. linear nature of GRUB’s costs, to capture the long-term value, DCF is the best valuation method.

4208204,104761,2018-09-25T14:42:43-04:00,GrubHub is the clear leader in the restaurant delivery market.The market is evolving rapidly.Uber Eats is aggressively eating into GrubHub's market share. There will likely be more mergers in this space.The stock is priced to perfection.,"GrubHub (GRUB) is the clear market leader in restaurant food delivery. With ~50% market share, the company, which went public in 2014, has grown revenue at a 40% CAGR since 2013 through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions of restaurant delivery rivals.The restaurant delivery market is evolving rapidly and is expected to grow at nearly 10% per annum through 2022. However, competitive pressure continues to build. Uber Eats is making major inroads into several markets. GrubHub is priced to perfection, and as the market continues to mature, a revenue miss is likely to crush the stock in the short-term. I'm new to this space, fascinated by the potential, but will hold off investing in GrubHub for now.There has been wide coverage of the restaurant delivery market. In April, Recode provided a snapshot of the market. GrubHub was the clear dominant player at the time with 50% market share. But the market has evolved rapidly. Just six months prior to the April 2018 article, GrubHub had 60% national market share and proceeded to lose 10% share though the company continued to grow at a torrid pace. In that same six-month period, Uber Eats doubled its national market share from 10% to 20%.Source of above graphic from April 2018: Recode.Another article published by Second Measure also illustrated how rapidly Uber Eats was growing in the space. Between Aug. 2017 and Feb. 2018, Uber Eats had gained dominant market share in 15 of the 40 largest US cities and had overtaken GrubHub in El Paso, Texas and Jacksonville, Florida. Over the six-month period tracked by Second Measure, Uber Eats crushed the competition in sales growth:Source of above graphic from April 2018: Second Measure.Despite Uber Eats' rapid ascension in the market, GrubHub has proven resilient among customers who order out frequently. But a countervailing statistic showed that Uber Eats had greater success retaining new clients over the six-month period studied by Second Measure.On Sept. 20, it was reported that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans expand its cashier-free store presence to 3,000 by 2021. The three existing Amazon cashier-free stores have focused on grab-and-go food, and rapid expansion of that concept nationwide could eat into the restaurant delivery market.It's worth noting that Amazon has been considered a threat to GrubHub and the space before. In 2017, Amazon moved into restaurant delivery through a partnership with Olo. However, in January of this year, Amazon announced layoffs in its Amazon Restaurants division and the company has been slow to gain traction in the market. The 2018 articles from both Recode and Second Measure indicate that Amazon's impact on the space has been almost nonexistent to this point.In the face of mounting competition, GrubHub has continued to win through strategic acquisitions and strong execution. GrubHub has beaten quarterly revenue growth expectations every quarter since Feb. 2016. The below screen grab from Seeking Alpha illustrates the impressive track record on quarterly revenue growth vs. expectations:As a result of this impressive performance, GrubHub stock has absolutely crushed the S&P 500 over the last three years:To strengthen its market position in recent years, GrubHub acquired various direct competitors in restaurant delivery. The company recently made a different type of acquisition when it acquired LevelUp, a mobile ordering and payments platform. The company acquired LevelUp to help fuel growth. LevelUp processes 100,000 daily restaurant orders and processes $400 million in restaurant sales annually.Available data suggests there is plenty of room for growth in the restaurant delivery space. Statista predicts the market will grow at nearly 10% annually through 2022. With GrubHub and competitors frantically jockeying for leadership positions in major cities, it seems likely that there will be more mergers. GrubHub has acquired several competitors, and GrubHub itself may prove to be an attractive target for a larger company like Amazon. It was reported that DoorDash had considered merging with rival PostMates earlier this year in order to compete more effectively compete with GrubHub and Uber Eats.The good news is that GrubHub is profitable. But the valuation appears stretched, which is not uncommon for a fast-growing company in a rapidly growing market. GrubHub's torrid growth rate has propelled its stock valuation, which is now priced to perfection. As the market intensifies and Uber Eats gains market share, a revenue miss in an upcoming quarter could crater the stock price. The company has grown free cash flow at a CAGR of 37% since 2013. Revenue has grown even faster at 50%, thanks to both organic growth and a continual strategy of acquiring competitors. Last quarter, revenue jumped 50%. Revenue growth in 2017 vs. 2016 was 38%.Annual revenue growth won't be 30+% forever. And GrubHub can't grow through acquisitions forever. Growth will slow. The free cash flow growth rate will slow. I had a hard time coming up with an FCF valuation that suggested the stock was a buy at $137. Other writers on Seeking Alpha have been banging the drum about the stock being overvalued for months.But it's hard to argue with GrubHub's position in the market. As it stands now, it looks like a solid three-way race between GrubHub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash. It's hard for me to believe either GrubHub or DoorDash will not be strong acquisition candidates, either for Uber or for a larger tech player at some point.I am not a buyer here. I'd love to see a revenue miss before I consider placing a bet on GrubHub. The stock has been flying high for over two years and will crash hard if it misses expectations in an upcoming quarter. One to keep an eye on."

Initially after reporting first quarter results earlier this month, the stock pulled back sharply, interrupting a year-to-date rally that had taken shares up more than 35%. GrubHub had beaten Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom line, but the beat margin was perhaps smaller than in prior quarters, and some food sales and user metrics also missed consensus expectations by a hair.In the days since, however, investors have pounced on GrubHub and sent it into recovery mode, chasing after the all-time highs that GrubHub posted in March:GRUB data by YChartsI've been bullish on GrubHub ever since the company made a series of strategic acquisitions last year to consolidate its grip on the food delivery space. The company is undoubtedly the largest and most well-known player in the hot and growing food delivery space. Though companies like Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER), Postmates, and DoorDash may entice new users with generous promos, it's unclear whether these private companies are profitable (likely not) and will be able to sustain its losses. GrubHub, on the other hand, is running an extremely profitable operation, with a free cash flow margin of 28% in Q1.The company's ability to initiate large-scale, national delivery partnerships is also impressive. GrubHub inked a recent deal with the Jack In The Box chain (JACK) to become its national delivery partner. This follows on the heels of last quarter's announcement that GrubHub was expanding its partnership with Yum! Brands (YUM), the owner of Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.All in all, GrubHub's growth story remains very much intact. It's true that GrubHub shares aren't cheap - after the recent rally, the stock trades at greater than 9x forward revenues and >30x forward EBITDA (see below), but the amount of growth and profit expansion that investors are getting with this stock is well worth the premium valuation. With so much momentum at its back as it continues to sign accretive partnerships and grab an even greater market share of a growing industry, GrubHub will continue to outperform the broader markets this year.GRUB EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsHere's a look at the company's results for the first quarter:Figure 1. GrubHub Q1 earningsSource: GrubHub investor relationsRevenues grew 49% y/y to $232.6 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $229.3 million in the quarter, or 47% y/y growth. This might be a smaller beat than investors wanted, but the fact that GrubHub's 49% growth matched its exiting Q4 growth rate of 49% is impressive, especially when considering that Q4 and Q1 are both accelerations over 47% growth in Q3. Not all of this growth is due to acquisitions, either. Adam DeWitt, the company's CFO, mentioned on the earnings call that organic growth excluding eat24 was 36%, still a robust figure.Active diners in the quarter grew 72% y/y, driven by the added user bases of GrubHub's acquired platforms as well as by organic growth via partnerships into new chains like Yum. Where the company missed expectations by a hair, however, was in its gross food sales - GrubHub transacted $1.245 billion in food sales this quarter, up 39% y/y and slightly below consensus of $1.26 billion (+40% y/y).The fact that GrubHub was able to maintain its gross food sales growth rate of 39% in Q4, however, is equally impressive as maintaining its revenue growth rate. Daily orders of 436.9k were up 35% y/y, but also missed consensus expectation of 442.5k (+36% y/y) by a slight margin.Figure 2. GrubHub diner metricsSource: GrubHub investor relationsWhere the company made up for it, however, was through increased revenues as a percentage of gross food sales, greatly boosting GrubHub's profit margins. Here's the commentary from management on the earnings call:The fact that GrubHub can continue to capture a greater percentage of its gross food sales as revenues in a supposedly competitive market (warnings that Uber Eats and Postmates were encroaching on GrubHub's territory were major concerns for the stock last year) is a telling sign of GrubHub's continued dominance in the space.Primarily as a result of this greater revenue share, GrubHub was able to deliver significantly expanded Adjusted EBITDA, its primary profit metric:Figure 3. GrubHub adjusted EBITDASource: GrubHub investor relationsAdjusted EBITDA grew 51% y/y to $64.1 million, representing a respectable 28% margin and slightly better than 27% in the year-ago period. A jump in operations and support costs in the quarter by increased operating leverage on the sales and marketing side.And lest you think that GrubHub's self-tailored EBITDA metric isn't a true indicator of its profitability, the company also generated $66.0 million of free cash flow in the quarter ($71.5 million of operating cash flows less $5.5 million of capex), also representing a 28% FCF margin. Pro forma EPS of $0.13 also showed meaningful upside to analysts' consensus of $0.39.Despite having recovered from its post-earnings lows, GrubHub still trades at about 10% lower than the all-time highs of $112 it reached in March. Given the extraordinary momentum that GrubHub has seen in recent weeks - from new national partnerships to increased revenues as a percentage of food sales - it's more than likely that GrubHub will be charting its way to new all-time highs soon.This company is a growth stock, so traditional valuation multiples are going to appear bloated. All in all, however, a 9x forward revenue multiple for a company that is achieving ~50% revenue growth quarter after quarter, while also generating similar expansion in its EBITDA and free cash flow, isn't too steep a price to ask for. Remain long on this fantastic company."

For starters, you need a clearly-defined time frame over which to measure results. My system uses 6-month time periods; you can use a different time frame, but it's crucial that you have a predetermined point at which you can objectively evaluate whether your selection was successful or not. Objectivity is needed here, but so is some humility. No security selection method is going to be successful all the time.

4184787,22148,2018-06-29T13:39:04-04:00,The gig economy is on the verge of being too successful.A shortage of delivery drivers would hurt the margins of GrubHub.The stock is extremely expensive at about 10x sales even after a pullback to $105.Watch key EBITDA per order figures this year for any impact.,"GrubHub (GRUB) has seen the stock reach a phenomenal level as the market increasingly accepts the food ordering and delivery concept. Canaccord Genuity even suggests that online food order and delivery service has become 'second nature' in the category. The huge success of the sector has the potential of running into one big roadblock as the stock reaches sky high valuations. Image Source: GrubHub website Having been bullish on the concept at much lower prices, an investor should always review what could cause a hiccup for the business and hurt the stock. The market knows all about the lack of truck drivers in the long haul segment so the lack of attention in relation to local delivery is a potential noteworthy misstep. As Amazon (AMZN) increasingly looks for same-day delivery with everyday items and especially groceries from Whole Foods Market, GrubHub will potentially find itself facing a shortage of delivery drivers. The recent rash of chain restaurants signing up with either GrubHub or top competitor Doordash could start taxing the system. According to job postings on Indeed.com (via Bloomberg), the market already faces a lack of drivers with job openings soaring. A lack of drivers means that delivery services will have to pay more to hire good drivers to keep up with the growing demand. From ride-sharing via Uber (UBER) to same-day delivery aspirations from Amazon, restaurants and grocery stores, the economy could run out of affordable delivery drivers. Amazon is even attempting to set up a partner program for last-mile delivery service called Delivery Service Partners.The plan could pull up to 100 delivery drivers off the market by using up to 40 vans in key markets for last-mile delivery. Though one might be careful building a business around serving Amazon, the bigger issue for GrubHub is whether this further strains the delivery driver shortage at a time when growth is still robust. The stock has now surpassed a valuation of $10 billion while revenues aren't forecasted to top $1 billion until next year. Such a gap is typically a time to think twice about owning a related stock. Canaccord slapped a $130 target on the stock. Reaching that target places a $11.7 billion market cap on the stock. The analyst heaps high praise on the company for innovating in the space:Always possible, but again one would want to be a seller at that level and not a buyer. These high praise statements tend to come at the top of the cycle and not the start and usually when a stock trades at stretched valuations such as 10x forward sales. The best part of GrubHub since the start was the growth concept while still generating profits and solid cash flows. Analysts forecast the trend to continue, but this is where the market should keep an eye on the potential driver crisis. As the company moved into delivery, GrubHub has been able to grow the EBITDA earned per order. For Q1, the number grew to $1.63 per order, up from $1.45 last year. The company isn't seeing any signs of cost inflation and made this statement about the market development that might actually differ with the real outcome of a driver shortage:At this point, the CFO still sees improving efficiency in the market due to scale driving driver pay per order down:For now, driver efficiencies are making the delivery process cheaper per order. The biggest issue is whether drivers will be available in the future as the gig economy has many demands for limited resources. Until self-driving cars can deliver food without a driver, GrubHub could have a key constraint to profitable growth. The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub has seen a small pullback to about $105, but the stock is still rather expensive with a market cap of $9.4 billion. The likelihood exists that a premium brand in food delivery like GrubHub will probably overcome the future driver shortage issue that will probably wreak havoc on smaller competitors that lack the scale. The market will eventually find a solution that reduces food deliveries reliance on a qualified driver, but in the meantime avoid the stock at the unreasonable valuation. The company is likely to face some cost pressures despite efficiencies from scale. Let the stock take an even bigger hit before buying."

Brands.The company again faces a big threat in the delivery sector.The stock trades at an expensive EBITDA multiple considering the competition, but one should expect a big end to 2018.","My early thesis on GrubHub (GRUB) was that competitive threats in the food online order and delivery market were overplayed. The company took a first mover advantage and strong brand in online ordering into dominating the food delivery market. The stock price though appears ahead of the game based on new competitive threats from Uber (UBER).My previous research was highly bullish on GrubHub, but my call was for the stock to rally into the mid-$60s. The stock actually ran all the way to $112 in a massive surge. The purchase of Eat24, Foodler, OrderUp and ensuing partnership with Yelp (YELP) set the online food ordering company up for undoubted market leadership.The combination of the deals that closed back in Q4 helped GrubHub post strong numbers and massive 2018 guidance.Source: GrubHub Q4'17 earnings release Analysts now forecast revenues hitting $951 million this year for nearly 40% growth followed by another 25% growth in 2019 to sales of nearly $1.2 billion.GRUB Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThough what really set the stock on fire was the announced partnership with Yum Brands! (YUM) and a $200 million strategic investment. The deal provided GrubHub with more cash for expansion following a similar amount spent to buy Eat24 from Yelp.Just as important, the partnership provided GrubHub with huge new online order pickup and delivery customers in the form of KFC and Taco Bell. The restaurants provide up to 45,000 new locations with GrubHub as the only national partner for these restaurant concepts.Source: GrubHub press release The deal also provides the interesting aspect of adding the Pizza Hut U.S. President to the board of directors and a working arrangement to figure out how to leverage the scale of the Pizza Hut delivery drivers that completed 100 million delivery transactions last year. The companies can potentially team up in smaller Tier 3 cities to quickly create a premier delivery service where a Pizza Hut restaurant has underutilized delivery drivers. Either way, the move is a big market share grab.The latest data from ReCode supports that GrubHub faces a big threat from Uber Eats. The ride service has seen market share top 20% with private DoorDash closely behind while GrubHub has seen share shrink from 60% back in August to below 50% now. The company has only been in the delivery business since 2015 so the market is still developing.Source: ReCodeDespite the importance of national brand recognition, food delivery is a local market. What a consumer has access to as far as restaurants in a way drives the food delivery service utilized. As well, the signing of a new partnership with a national restaurant chain can shift market share in the short term. As a prime example, Uber Eats is the leader in Texas while GrubHub is the dominant player in most large NE markets.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson probably best sums up the investment equation in the stock. The bullish analyst only places a $115 target on the stock while not seeing Uber Eats as an ultimate threat. The delivery service has a primary focus on driving people over food delivery. A partnership with McDonald's (MCD) probably accounts for a large portion of the share gains while the lack of market coverage by GrubHub allowed some low hanging fruit for Uber to initially grab customers.GrubHub only entered the year covering 80 markets with delivery. The recent partnerships with Yelp, Foursquare and Yum! Brands all occurred during the last few months, suggesting GrubHub could easily reverse the shrinking share trends. Due in part to these partnerships, GrubHub has already entered another 34 markets this year with more to come.Prior to buying Eat24, GrubHub only had about 60,000 locations on the food ordering platform. The network should now exceed 100,000 with additional Yum! Brands locations set to double the total within the year. These additional locations will help delivery locations grow substantially from 30,000 and help GrubHub move beyond what the company estimates as 5% market share of an up to $200 billion market in food ordering and delivery.The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub is probably too expensive up here trading above 35x EBITDA estimates. The competitive threats appear overblown, but the risk is higher with the stock above $100 while even the most bullish analyst doesn't see much upside from here.The stock turns interesting towards the end of 2018 when the Yum! Brands partnership kicks into gear and the seasonal strong period starts back up. GrubHub likely has some upside to the targets due to the scale of the Yelp and Yum! partnerships while the goal is to buy the stock on at least a 10% dip from here with the possibility that the gap to $70 eventually closes."
4165181,73185,2018-04-24T11:37:16-04:00,"GRUB stock was highlighted at the Sohn Investor Conference.While the qualitative story underlying GRUB stock is robust, the numbers don't add up to a $100-plus stock.Uber Eats is rapidly gaining market share, and that will turn into a serious headwind for GRUB soon.GRUB stock looks overvalued here and now.","After nearly tripling over the past year, GrubHub (GRUB) stock has reasonably taken a breather over the past month as analysts have downgraded on valuation concerns while investors have hit pause on buying. But GRUB was given new life at the Sohn Investor Conference after Half Sky Capital's Li Ran talked up GRUB as a solid investment.Unfortunately, while we understand the qualitative bull thesis on GRUB, we just can't get there on the numbers. This is one of the best growth stories in the market, but the stock is priced as such. Thus, we think GRUB stock looks like more risk than reward at these levels and believe the stock could fall big on any operational hiccups, which could come soon thanks to rising competition.GRUB data by YChartsWe've been bullish on GRUB stock before but recently turned bearish after the stock neared triple-digit range. The growth story remains robust. The company is thriving in the overlap of the at-home and on-demand economies which are both surging in popularity. As opposed to going to the movies, shopping at malls, and eating out, consumers are watching Netflix (NFLX), shopping on Amazon (AMZN), and ordering from GrubHub. In this sense, GRUB is powered by the same underlying growth drivers as NFLX and AMZN.But GRUB is different in two huge ways. One, the company is actually losing market share. Two, GRUB's margins are shrinking, not expanding.On the first point, GRUB has been able to outrun competitive threats over the past several quarters to the tune of accelerating revenue growth. This has been due exclusively to the fact that the online food ordering and delivery market has grown at a robust enough rate to offset steady market share losses. GRUB's market share has fallen from above 60% last August to below 50% today. The culprit? Uber Eats, which has not only surged in market share from ~12% to over 20% during that same time frame but which also has become the most popular digital food ordering platform in nine of the 22 most-populous U.S. cities.(Source: Recode)Eventually, market growth will slow to a point where market share losses matter and start turning into decelerating revenue growth for GRUB. At that point, GRUB will turn from an accelerating growth narrative into a decelerating growth narrative. That could cause material weakness in shares, which currently trade at more than 60-times forward earnings.GRUB PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOn the second point, GRUB's margins are actually in retreat because delivery is playing a bigger role in the operating model. Absorbing higher delivery costs means lower margins for the entire GRUB business. That's why last year, GRUB's pre-tax profit margins dropped from 17% in the prior two years to 13%. Management said on the most recent quarterly conference call that margins are due for some volatility going forward because of this delivery dynamic. As such, margins likely won't zoom higher in the foreseeable future.Because of these headwinds, GRUB is no NFLX or AMZN. It is powered by the same growth drivers, but it also has bigger competition and larger margin concerns. At these levels, we do not believe that GRUB stock is at all priced appropriately enough considering these headwinds.At best, we think GRUB can do around $5 in earnings per share in five years, driven by a combination of 30%-plus revenue growth and opex-leverage-driven pre-tax margin expansion to 20%. Those are fairly aggressive assumptions, but we also think achievable given the robust growth in the on-demand, at-home economy. We would want 10% annualized return out of GRUB stock, so that would put our ideal price for GRUB stock in four years at roughly $150. In order to get to $150 in five years, GRUB stock would need to trade at a 30-times forward earnings multiple on our reasonable five-year-out earnings target of $5 per share.Thus, in order for us to be buyers today, we would need GRUB stock to trade at a 30-times forward earnings multiple in five years. We don't think that will happen. The market multiple is 16-times forward earnings. The average multiple for a growth stock is 19-times forward earnings. Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) trade in the low-to-mid 20s in terms of forward earnings multiple. From this perspective, we view it as nearly impossible for GRUB to warrant a 30-times multiple in five years, after most of its growth has already happened and with competitive threats looming presumably larger than ever (GRUB is losing market share at a rapid rate).FB PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOverall, we think that in order to be comfortable buying GRUB stock above $100, you need a lot of confidence not only in the growth trajectory (which we have) but also a lot of confidence in the type of multiple this stock will warrant in five years, when most of its growth is in the rear-view mirror. We don't have confidence that GRUB stock will warrant a huge multiple in five years, mostly because market share trends run counter to the idea that GRUB will keep growing at a robust rate in five-plus years once overall market growth has cooled.As such, we think GRUB stock looks overextended trading above $100."
4126498,103480,2017-11-20T15:15:57-05:00,"GrubHub, the on-demand restaurant delivery service, has quickly become one of the most successful and profitable apps in the industry.The company recently soared to all-time highs after it reported a blowout Q3 and lifted its forecast above analyst consensus.GrubHub is a pure logistics and delivery company, unlike high-profile flameout Blue Apron which has had sinking gross margins due to rising food costs.Unlike its high-profile competitor UberEATS, GrubHub has actually found the formula for growth while operating profitably.Scale is GrubHub's biggest advantage over its newer and smaller peers, and it will likely be the last left standing after the ongoing wave of industry consolidation.","There's something magic about the way GrubHub (NASDAQ: GRUB) continues to succeed despite high-profile flameouts like Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN), one of the biggest decliners among tech IPOs this year. GrubHub, which went public in 2014 at a price of $26, has returned over 150% to investors in just three years. And with its most recent quarter, GrubHub's growth trajectory looks set to continue, even as it reaches for a gigantic $6 billion market cap.GrubHub's success is set against a backdrop of failures in the broader ""food-tech"" industry - and though these companies tend to fall under the same umbrella, they operate starkly different business models. Blue Apron, for example, operates in the accursed meal-kit space, and this year it's been met by both a decline in revenue growth and customer retention as well as logistics challenges at its new fulfillment center in Linden, New Jersey. The company has responded by laying off a massive portion of its workforce. The divergence in GrubHub's stock performance relative to Blue Apron's is a tale of two cities:GRUB data by YChartsElsewhere in the food-delivery world, venture-backed Sprig (which had raised nearly $60 million from venerable VCs such as Greylock) and Maple ($30 million raised) closed their doors earlier this year. As did Spoonrocket, which shut down a year earlier.And then there's the companies that are still around - but struggling to make it. UberEATS, in particular, is beleaguered by the drama surrounding its parent, which is growing quickly but losing billions in the process, while getting used to new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and fending off boardroom drama from founder Travis Kalanick. And while not much is known about the still-private Postmates and DoorDash, which are also direct meal-delivery competitors to GrubHub, some articles suggest that these companies are still reaching for profitability - while GrubHub has generated $45 million in GAAP net income and $94 million in free cash flow in the year to date.So clearly, GrubHub is doing something right. And while the stock isn't cheap - trading at ~8x revenues and 44x consensus FY18 EPS of $1.49, as reported by Yahoo Finance - GrubHub's 30%-plus topline growth as well as earnings growth make it a solid long in the Internet sector and a safe bet on possibly the only food-tech company to achieve both growth and profitability. And as GrubHub continues to succeed, it's eating up the competition - this year alone, it acquired three of its competitors: Foodler, OrderUp, and eat24. Because GrubHub relies so much on its so-called ""Two-Way Network,"" the benefits of increased size through acquisition create a virtuous cycle for GrubHub's business.GrubHub, as most know, operates a simple food-delivery service. It partners with local restaurants to deliver meals to its users. It was founded in 2004 and in 2013, it merged with Seamless, another online meal-ordering platform that caters primarily to corporate clients. It went public in 2014 at $26/share.The below screenshot shows an example of a restaurant search on the GrubHub mobile app:Source: GrubHub mobile appGrubHub generates revenue on a per-meal basis. Restaurants on the platform pay a commission, typically 13.5%. They can also choose to pay a higher rate to achieve a ""sponsored"" listing as shown above, increasing their prominence in a search.The app has increasingly gained in popularity over the past few years. In 2012, GrubHub counted just under 1 million ""active diners"" on its platform - which it defines as unique diner accounts that have placed at least one order in the past twelve months; as of the end of 2016, GrubHub had accumulated 8.2 million active diners and by 3Q17, that figure had swelled to 9.8 million:Figure 1. GrubHub metrics since 2012Source: 10-KThe company also discloses a ""daily average Grubs"" metric that highlights the average number of orders per day in a given time period. As of Q3, GrubHub delivers an astonishing 304,500 meals per day (+14% y/y).Like Uber, GrubHub does not directly employ its army of drivers, instead treating them as contractors. Delivery costs account for the largest portion of GrubHub's expenses, and are quickly growing as a percentage of revenues - operations and support costs have climbed to 40% of revenues in 3Q17, up from 36% in 3Q16. Still, however, GrubHub has been profitable on a GAAP basis since at least 2011 (its first publicly released year of financial statements, included in its S-1), even as the company has grown more than 10x from a $60 million annual revenue to its current $650 million run rate - something probably no other food delivery company can claim.The secret is scale. The combined duo of Seamless and GrubHub, which has a decade lead over Postmates (founded in 2011), DoorDash (2013), and Uber (2009, though UberEATS launched just recently in 2015), is the largest company in the food-delivery space. Shuttling food across cities, especially when driver and fulfillment costs are rising, is a low-margin business, and it takes serious capital investment to build and maintain the back end technology as well as muster up marketing resources to attract more users. While many startups had sprung up in the space, many - like SpoonRocket - have folded due to overhead costs consuming an ever-thinning gross margin. Meal-kit companies like Blue Apron and Sprig, who also bear the burden of food costs in addition to delivery, have been even more prone to failure.In this area GrubHub has found a formula that works, focusing itself as a delivery service-only company that's achieved a critical mass in its network and driven industry-leading efficiency in its logistics and delivery capabilities. And as smaller players bump up against the challenges of being small in an industry that requires scale, GrubHub has swallowed the competition. In recent years, the company has stepped up its M&A game, expanding its user base of diners and adding restaurants to its growing portfolio. The following table, taken from Crunchbase, shows GrubHub's acquisition history and the accelerated pace of its dealmaking since 2016:Figure 2. GrubHub acquisitionsSource: CrunchbaseIn addition to Eat24 and Foodler, GrubHub also acquired 27 markets from OrderUp, a subsidiary of Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN). GrubHub disclosed that these acquisitions cost the company roughly $360 million.Network effects and scaling upward are especially important to GrubHub, as it benefits from what it describes in its 10-K as a ""two-way network."" More diners will sign up for accounts if the restaurants they like are available on GrubHub; likewise, more restaurants will sign up to partner with GrubHub if there are more diners they can reach. Acquiring users and customers is the quickest path to growth, and has been largely responsible for the growth that GrubHub has seen in the past two years. With GrubHub's ~$6 billion market cap and $330 million in cash that's supported by positive operating cash flows, it's probably the company best positioned to buy up all the fledgling food-tech startups that are losing cash and desperate for a save.Industry consolidation will likely only continue as the smallest and weakest startups fold and the average ones sell to the GrubHubs of the world. When the dust settles, GrubHub will likely be one of the few (or only) meal delivery services left standing. The trend of takeout delivery will only continue as more and more consumers stay home and order everything on-demand, and GrubHub is the company that's best positioned to capitalize on this trend as it matures.In Q3, GrubHub generated $163.1 million in revenue (+32% y/y), a beat over analyst consensus of $159.7 million (+29% y/y). Gross food sales were $867.3 million in the quarter (+18% y/y), and the company reached 9.8 million active diners.Year to date, in the nine months through Q3, the company has generated $478 million in revenues - almost as much as it generated in the entire fiscal 2017 ($493.3 million).Figure 3. GrubHub Q3 resultsSource: GrubHub earnings press releaseProfitability, however, has seen a slight (1.5% y/y) decline due to the impacts of adding loss-bearing acquisitions (eat24, Foodler, and OrderUp) to its books. The company generated $13.0 million of GAAP net income, down from $13.2 million in 3Q16. However, the company's adjusted EPS of $0.28 still handily beat Wall Street consensus of $0.24.The company's reduced profit margins due to acquisitions illustrates an important point: GrubHub has been able to absorb its loss-bearing competitors into its network; it's one of the only companies in the space that has the ability to do so. As these companies become more fully integrated into GrubHub and can take advantage of shared overhead resources, GrubHub can turn its acquisitions into profitable operations.Looking forward, GrubHub expects revenue of $197 - $205 million in Q4, indicating +46% y/y growth at the midpoint, showcasing its ability to meaningfully accelerate growth through acquisitions. Analysts had only expected $183.3 million in Q4 (+33% y/y), causing the stock to pop 10% post-Q3 as analysts revise their estimates upward. GrubHub also forecast $51-$56 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.At GrubHub's current market cap of $5.6 billion less $331.6 million in cash (the company has no debt), GrubHub has an enterprise value of ~$5.27 billion.Taking the midpoint of GrubHub's revenue guidance of $197 - $205 million in revenue and $51-$56 million in adjusted EBITDA for Q4, and adding those figures to the company's year to date results, we find that GrubHub trades at multiples of:If we extrapolate these multiples out into FY18 and assume the company grows revenues and EBITDA at 30% and 25%, respectively, we find that GrubHub trades at an FY18 revenue multiple of 6.0x and 23.2x, respectively.Consumer-facing internet companies tend to trade at a wide range of multiples, as seen in the chart below, so it's fairly difficult to create the perfect comp set for GrubHub.GRPN EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsHowever, given the company's premium growth rate and the fact that it's one of the rare Internet companies that's generating a positive GAAP profit (and possibly the only food-tech company to do so), GrubHub deserves a premium to peers. I'd look to 8x EV/FY18 revenues ($78) as a fair price target for the company, implying 20% upside from current levels.In the food-tech space, it seems that the big will continue getting bigger while the small die off. In an industry where logistics and efficiency are key, GrubHub's large scale has allowed it to build a profitable delivery network and add smaller, unprofitable companies like Eat24 to chase more growth and market share.Secular trends toward on-demand everything and takeout delivery are on the rise, and GrubHub is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the trend. As high-profile failures like Blue Apron have scared off the VC community from pumping more funding into new food-tech startups, there will likely be fewer competitors entering the space, and GrubHub will be primarily up against the likes of UberEATS and Amazon Restaurants. With its history operating profitably, however, and its strategy of growth-by-acquisition already well underway, GrubHub is well equipped to continue its dominance in the space.Even despite GrubHub's superb performance year to date, up nearly 2x and beating both the internet sector and the broader NASDAQ, the stock still has room to run."
4145576,103480,2018-02-12T07:39:13-05:00,"GrubHub reported a blowout Q4 earnings, accelerating revenue growth and beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines.The company's recent acquisitions have been extremely accretive to the company's growth.Yum! Brands, the large-cap restaurant operator, also announced an operating as well as financial partnership with GrubHub, purchasing $200 million of GrubHub's stock.The stock continues to see massive appreciation despite a broad market selloff, and though GrubHub's stock isn't cheap, momentum will likely feed further outperformance.","While the rest of the food-tech space seemingly crumbles (Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP) fell on earnings last week; and let's not even get started on the horror show at Blue Apron (NASDAQ: APRN)), GrubHub (NASDAQ: GRUB) continues to stand out among the rest, having planted itself firmly as the ""Uber"" of the food delivery and takeout industry. Despite worries of competition against UberEats, the company continues to deliver against growth targets and make meaningful progress toward profitability.The fourth quarter brought many new and exciting elements to the GrubHub story, the least of which are the raw growth numbers GrubHub delivered in the quarter. Concurrently with its earnings release, Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) announced a huge expansion to its partnership with GrubHub through a joint press release.The partnership is two-pronged. The most important aspect, in my opinion, is the operational one: Yum!, which already deploys GrubHub in more than half of its 45,000 restaurants, will continue to accelerate adoption of GrubHub across its network of KFCs and Taco Bells. The deeper relationship with an anchor restaurateur like Yum! will drive fantastic revenue growth for GrubHub in FY18, which is already growing at a lithe ~50% pace this quarter thanks to a slew of smart acquisitions completed in the year. It's also indicative to note that, as GrubHub announced on its earnings call, GrubHub is the only nationwide partner to Yum! in the U.S. across its restaurant footprint.The second portion of the partnership is financial: Yum! also agreed to acquire a $200 million stake in GrubHub's equity (with GrubHub's current market cap at ~$7.5 billion, this is still a minority stake) as well as a seat on the GrubHub board. As reported by Seeking Alpha News, analysts have applauded the move, and while conceding that GrubHub isn't exactly a value stock, they raised their price targets on GrubHub.GrubHub's stock has seemingly defied gravity against a broad market selloff, especially in other ""food-tech"" stocks where Yelp and Blue Apron continue to crumble as investors flee to safety. Year to date, GrubHub is up 19% (following an already impressive run in 2017) while both Yelp and Blue Apron took fresh tumbles.GRUB data by YChartsThe gains are a validation of GrubHub's market-leading business model. As more and more Americans expect ""on-demand"" services to expand to food and takeout, GrubHub's leading position will allow it to continue its uber-growth. While valuation is a slight concern, it pales next to the momentum GrubHub has seen over the past year. Remain long on this powerhouse as it continues to streamline operations and add to its giant network of restaurants.Here's a look at GrubHub's Q4 results:Figure 1. GrubHub Q4 resultsSource: GrubHub investor relationsGrubHub's revenues grew 49% y/y to $205.1 million, surpassing analyst expectations for $201.7 million (+47% y/y). This also represents acceleration over the 37% revenue growth GrubHub saw in Q3.It's important to note that a lot of this growth was driven by acquisitions that were fully baked into Q4 earnings - in particular, the acquisition of eat24 from Yelp (the very subject of which was a pain point in Yelp's earnings). But also recall that GrubHub guided to a midpoint of 47% revenue growth in Q4 on its Q3 earnings call, so some of the outperformance must have been organic.GrubHub acquired 4 million ""active diners"" from acquisitions in the quarter, and ended the quarter with 14.5 million active diners - a huge boost from Q4 of last year:Figure 2. GrubHub user metricsSource: GrubHub investor relationsGross food sales also grew 39% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, annualizing to about $4.5 billion. For some context around that number - Yum! Brands' annual worldwide revenue is about $6 billion, and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is $23 billion. These brick-and-mortar presences obviously still have a decent leg up over GrubHub, but as GrubHub begins to crack the billion-dollar mark in gross food sales, it's becoming quite a giant in its own right - especially if it manages to expand into a meaningful international presence soon.Even though GrubHub's trifecta of acquisitions (eat24, OrderUp and Foodler) were all unprofitable, GrubHub also managed to increase its earnings and cash flow in the quarter across all measures - which is tremendously rare for companies that acquire loss-bearing startups. Equally important to note is that with GrubHub's space, scale is the key - so as GrubHub begins to integrate these smaller platforms into its infrastructure, it can operate them much more efficiently than they could run standalone. In effect, GrubHub is unlocking a lot of value from these smaller platforms.GAAP net income in the quarter of $53.5 million ($0.60 diluted GAAP EPS) was about 4x last year's net income of $13.6 million, but as the company's CFO noted on the earnings call, GrubHub took in a one-time benefit of $34 million related to the passage of the Trump tax bill. Pro forma earnings (which adjust for one-tine effects) are thus the better measure of the company's profitability; and GrubHub's PF EPS result of $0.37 crushed analyst estimates for $0.31.Cash flow also saw meaningful upside in the quarter. GrubHub grew operating cash flow to $152.7 million, up 56% y/y from $97.7 million in 4Q16. Free cash flow in the quarter was $133.7 million (netting out $19 million of capex), up a staggering 82% y/y from $73.6 million in 4Q16.Most analysts and investors, though, primarily view GrubHub's earnings through an EBITDA lens, and on this front, GrubHub didn't disappoint either.Figure 3. GrubHub EBITDA walkdownSource: GrubHub investor relationsGrubHub's Adjusted EBITDA metrics include standard addbacks for stock comp and one-time acquisition expenses on top of a standard EBITDA calculation. The company's Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $57.0 million grew 45% y/y from $39.2 million in the prior Q4, and is up 27% y/y for the full year.And with an outlook for $225-$255 million in Adjusted EBITDA in FY18, GrubHub is pointing to 30% EBITDA growth in the coming year. GrubHub's unmatched ability to grow earnings as well as the top line and diner statistics show the importance of network effects in a logistics company - and as the company continues to integrate its acquired platforms and grow organically through large-scale partnership like that with Yum!, revenue growth will snowball into even larger bottom-line expansion.By most measures, GrubHub is extremely and indecently expensive. Most investors have no problem with GrubHub's story and its performance (which is the beef they have with other food-tech stocks), but they can't stomach its seemingly bloated valuation. After the company's February rally, it carries a market cap of $7.4 billion. Netting out $257.7 million of cash and $173.5 million of debt, its enterprise value is $7.31 billion.Based on the company's EBITDA guidance of $225-$255 million, as well as its revenue guidance of $910-$960 million for FY18, the company is currently trading at an enterprise value multiples of:I have mixed feelings about these numbers. While the recent market turmoil has made a lot of other tech stocks much cheaper than they were in January, creating much better value opportunities in internet and software names, it's also hard to declare that the GrubHub bubble will deflate anytime soon. With such powerful tailwinds behind it in terms of large-scale partnerships and secular shifts toward on-demand takeout, GrubHub has plenty of opportunity over the short term to grow into its large valuation. With enthusiasm for the name backing its huge momentum, it's hard to see GrubHub cratering this year - especially as the effects of a large-scale rollout of the platform across the KFC and Taco Bell footprint is probably underestimated.GrubHub wouldn't be my first choice to buy in today's market - but if you're holding the stock, you probably won't regret it either."
4146119,73185,2018-02-13T13:41:45-05:00,"GRUB has outperformed all of the FANG stocks over the past year.This is a big growth company with a long runway.Despite being bullish on the company's growth narrative, we just can't get there on the valuation.We think fair value is around $75.","We have followed GrubHub (GRUB) closely for some time now. Most recently, when it was a sub-$60 stock, we thought GRUB was a screaming buy and put a fair value on the stock of $70. Since then, GRUB stock ran up to and above $90 after yet another blowout quarterly report. It's come back down to $85 and change, but even at that price, GRUB stock is up nearly 115% over the past year, much better than the trailing twelve month performances of the S&P 500, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG).Despite the strong quarterly numbers and our formerly bullish stance, we just can't get there on an $80-plus price tag for GRUB stock. We continue to believe this stock is fairly valued around $70-75. Consequently, we will wait for a pullback before getting bullish on this name again.GRUB data by YChartsEverywhere you look, GrubHub's fourth quarter was astounding. Across the board, every single operational metric showed strength. Revenue growth accelerated to 49%, the best mark it has had all year. Gross food sales growth accelerated to 39%, also the best mark it has had all year. Active Diners growth (organic ex Eat24 adds) was greater than 28%, again the best mark of the year. Daily Active Grubs growth was 34%, another 2017 high. In other words, across all important top-line business metrics, the business accelerated in the fourth quarter.This is crucial to the company's growth narrative. Mostly everyone agreed that the digital food ordering and delivery market had secular growth prospects, but competition was supposed to kill this company. It hasn't. Instead, for each of the past 3 years, revenue growth has hovered around 40%, gross food sales growth has hovered around 30%, and DAGs growth has hovered around 20%. Nothing is slowing. This speaks to two things: 1) the digital food ordering market is growing much faster than anyone expected, and 2) GRUB is maintaining its market share in this rapid growth market despite elevated competition.Both of those observations underscore that this is a secular growth company with a huge revenue growth opportunity in front of it. Core addressable restaurant spend in the United States is $210 billion, but less than 5% of that ($10 billion) is online food ordering. That online penetration rate is far less than the digital commerce penetration rate of roughly 9-10% (and that is still growing by roughly 100 basis points per year). Considering the trends in favor of the at-home economy (think of how Netflix (NFLX) is taking over movie theaters and how Amazon is killing malls), we believe it is very likely that digital penetration in the food ordering world hits 10% rather soon.That implies a doubling of the market rather soon. We think this could happen in 2-3 years (research firm Technavio thinks this is a 32% per year growth market). Considering that GRUB has been able to maintain huge growth despite elevated competition, we think that GRUB should be able to maintain majority market share over the next several years. Even if we assume some market share shrinkage due to competition, GRUB should still be able to grow revenues somewhere in the 25-30% range over the next several years.Meanwhile, margins aren't booming higher because the company is more focused on EBITDA dollar growth, not EBITDA margin growth. But as is true with most hyper-growth operations, revenue scale eventually drives tremendous margin expansion. Overall, we believe that 27.5% revenue growth will turn into something like 35% earnings growth over the next 5 years (analysts are calling for 23% long-term earnings growth, but GRUB has shown an ability to consistently top analyst estimates, so we are comfortable with our 35% estimate).But even at that 35% estimate, we don't believe GRUB is worth $90. The market is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.3. A 1.3 PEG on 35% growth implies a 45.5 forward earnings multiple. EPS estimates over the next 12 months are roughly $1.65. A 45.5 multiple on $1.65 gets us to a fair value of roughly $75.GRUB EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsOverall, while we love the GRUB growth narrative, we just can't get there on a $90 stock. This is a great company, but the stock is out over its skis here, so we think waiting for a pullback is the right move."

On this occasion, I decided to post an article detailing my yet unpublished internal valuation of the company to show whether there is still some fuel in the tank for either existing or potential new investors.GrubHub is a food ordering and delivery company. In essence, it acts as a platform, a marketplace bringing together restaurants, on the one hand, and hungry diners, on the other. It is attractive for diners because it is an easy and quick way to find food to order and there is much to choose from; it is attractive for restaurants, since they could then have an access to millions of potential customers, thus lifting their visibility and revenue potential. To enable this service, GrubHub charges a fee from restaurants in the form of a commission from each order made on the platform (this is, by far, the major source of revenue, though other proceeds are delivery fees, extra commissions for prominence on the platform, and advertising). Provided below is the trailing-twelve-month (TTM) adjusted income statement for the last four years of operations:Source: Company 10-Ks and author's calculationsNote that I have capitalized technology expenses, as I view these to be investments into platform development and improvement, yielding long-term benefits. Consequently, for each year, I added back technology expense for that year and subtracted amortization expense of the newly created synthetic asset over three prior years (I assume three-year linear amortization period).And to put the table on revenue-relative basis (common size income statement), here is what we get:Unlike its major counterparts from Europe (Delivery Hero, Takeaway, and Just Eat (OTC:JSTLF)), GRUB is not only profitable but quite substantially so, with aggregate four-year adjusted operating margin of 21%, with further potential for improvement upon continuing impact from the economies of scale (e.g. declining operations and support percentage relative to revenues) and contraction on marketing expenses, once the company reaches significant market share as well as scale.But before going too deep into profitability, it is important to put revenue under the spotlight. Growing at four-year TTM CAGR of 39% is impressive, but the topline figure masks the driving forces behind the numbers. On this occasion, I have decomposed revenue into four components driving the company's revenues: order value per customer, orders per customer, total number of customers (diners), and commission rate. The tables below present annual and TTM decomposed revenues in absolute terms and percentage growth rates from the previous year:Source: Company 10-Ks and author's calculationsBased on these figures, it is interesting to note that the average number of orders per customer over the period has been relatively flat at 12 per year, while commission rate and order value have been gradually rising. Meanwhile, the number of active diners has grown massively over the full five-year period at almost 34% CAGR and, as can be seen from the year-on-year decomposition of revenue growth, it has been the single most contributing factor for revenue expansion (for instance, it contributed 47 percentage points out of total revenue growth rate of 85% in 2014), with other factors (including the factor-to-factor interaction term) having none to comparatively insignificant impact.Given how important online user growth is to GRUB, I looked at the study conducted by Statista in November this year showing that the number of users in the online takeaway segment of the US market will grow from 31.8 million in 2016 to 94.7 million in 2022, translating into a 20% CAGR, and implying that the current market share for the company, in terms of online user penetration rate, is about 26% based on 8.2mln diners in 2016 (10-K, 2016). It is noteworthy, however, that the actual revenue growth rate that I am going to forecast will depend both on growing online takeaway users shown above and expanding market share; it will also be enhanced by some growth in commission rate and order value.Moving from the company- to industry-based focus and drawing examples from GrubHub's European counterparts mentioned earlier in the article, we can notice a unique industry feature - all these 'aggregators', as they are commonly referred to, have markedly pronounced ""spheres of influence"", with poorly performing markets - lost due to a strong foothold of a major competitor - being sold off (often to that very major competitor). It is because of this reason that Delivery Hero sold its operations in Georgia (to Menu Group), in Kazakhstan (to Chocofamily) and in the UK (to Just Eat); Just Eat offloaded businesses in Belgium and the Netherlands (to Takeaway.com); and Takeway.com closed its doors in the UK (selling to Just Eat). Unsurprisingly, none of these players are present in the US for one simple reason - GrubHub. As a consequence, I see no direct competition for GRUB in the US in the online takeaways market stemming from nation-wide aggregators, except for the one coming from the existence of either local players, more traditional direct-restaurant phone ordering, or such ride-sharing companies as Lyft or UberEats (even though the latter category may seem to pose a considerable threat, it is worth remembering that it is not their primary business, and food smell inside a car may ruin customer satisfaction from the core business).My narrative for GrubHub is that of a still growing company, with strong foothold in the US online takeaway business, already positive and improving operating profit margins, relatively low and declining risk level, and capital-light business model. Its extensive two-sided restaurant-diner platform is not only attractive to either side but also acts as a natural moat, which will protect it from any nation-wide competition even in the long-term - thus, helping GRUB sustain excess returns on investment.Looking at the upper portion of the table, note that I added capitalised R&D expenses (consistent with applying R&D depreciation expense in the adjusted income statement above) since I view them as an investment on the part of the company. The median sales-to-capital ratio over the last five fiscal years has been 0.58 in the upper, while the aggregate five-year incremental sales to reinvestment ratio in the bottom part of the table is 2.47. Given that the former is based on existing assets in place and the former is based on incremental (being closer to future marginal investments), as well as the US restaurant industry overall sales-to-capital ratio of 1.39, I will apply a figure of 1.93 (a mid-point of 1.39 and 2.47).Given that reinvestments do not end after year ten, we have to make an assumption for that as well. The terminal period reinvestment rate will be computed from the following equation below:Sustainable growth = ROIC * reinvestment rateGiven an assumed sustainable growth rate during the terminal period equal to 2.38% (ten-year Treasury rate) and an ROIC of 12% (which assumes the company will be able to sustain its competitive advantage in the long-term in excess of the terminal period WACC, the reinvestment rate can be calculated as:Reinvestment rate = 2.38%/12% = 19.83%;Apart from these major assumptions, I also assumed the following:The table below presents the model output results:With current share price of around $72, the stock price seems to have reached its fair value. Nevertheless, as always, I conducted Monte Carlo analysis around some of the valuation input assumptions, which contribute the most to value, as well as those I have more uncertainty about. The simulation assumptions are as follows:While it is not surprising that the median value of $75 is close to my base-case value of $73, more important is the fact that the range between 10th and 90th percentiles is very narrow. Therefore, not only does the simulation suggests that the current price is fair it also indicates that only under very extreme (and significantly less likely) scenarios can we expect price diverging considerably away from $63-90 range.Significant stock price appreciation this year for GrubHub has created an uncertain situation both for existing shareholders (of whether to close open positions) and prospective investors (of whether to jump-in in anticipation of potential continued growth in the future). The aim of this article is to share my internal valuation and shed some light on the hard investment decision-making issue. While investors should not construe this as an investment advice, it is expected they will be better equipped in realizing that the $63-90 range discussed above can be thought of as a target value zone (though with varying probabilities)."
4116699,103773,2017-10-26T08:59:10-04:00,"Grubhub sounded a bullish tone regarding its recent acquisitions (Foodler, Orderup, and Eat24): the closure, integration timeline, and the benefits to the top and bottom lines.Despite tougher comps and the impact from hurricanes, Grubhub showed impressive organic growth.With a network of almost 10 million active diners, best-in-class delivery logistics and world-class customer support, Grubhub is in a prime position to reap the benefits of a massive tailwind.","Grubhub (GRUB) earnings delivered on all fronts -- a bullish progress report on its recent acquisitions, a beat on the recent quarter, and a re-emphasis on the massive secular tailwind of the food delivery market. Even though the stock moved up to its previous all-time high, as I had articulated in my previous report, I believe that good times are still ahead for GRUB.Grubhub has shown a consistent track record of organic growth and growth through acquisitions. I believe that, going forward, the investor focus should be on Grubhub becoming a successful aggregator of diners and take-out restaurants. This is not dissimilar to online aggregators in other industries, such as Priceline (PCLN) in the online travel arena.Based on the details provided during the earnings call, Grubhub will generate an additional $200M-plus per-year revenue run-rate when the Eat24 acquisition is completed in Q3 2018. This is how I arrive at this figure. According to Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney (emphasis added): ""We expect our overall growth in 2018 to be significantly higher than that $800 million in GFS when you include the organic growth of the Grubhub and Seamless brands."" In another statement, he said: ""Net revenue as a percentage of gross food sales was 18.8% during the first quarter, up 200 basis points from the prior year's 16.8%."" I expect minimal improvement in EPS in 2018 due to duplication of expenses across the two platforms.My expectation is that the sell side will update their models with some of the $200M revenue in the second half of 2018, and a pro-rated 20%-plus organic growth for 2019. Based on the track record of several acquisitions every year and several hints during the call, I expect more mergers in 2018, further consolidating GRUB's position as an aggregator.The key metrics -- active diners, daily active grubs, and gross food sales -- are all tracking well. They show a consistent low to mid-20s year-over-year growth rate, despite extraneous factors like hurricanes and tougher comps.When compared to the likes of Amazon (AMZN), UberEats, and other well-capitalized competitors, it appears as if Grubhub is holding up quite well. My takeaway is that there's still a lot of room for all to grow. Grubhub's gross food sales are approaching $4B annually, and the market is over $200B. It will be some time before the industry narrows to two or three key players.While the stock moved up after the earnings announcement and the call, I believe it has more room to grow over the next several years -- both organically and through acquisitions."
4117764,73185,2017-10-28T07:07:54-04:00,"GRUB reported blowout third-quarter earnings and the stock soared.This is becoming a trend for GRUB's stock, which has outperformed FB, AMZN, NFLX, and GOOG over the past 12 months.More upside remains given the company's ability to grow market share in a rapidly growing market.$70 seems like a reasonable 12-month forward price target.","In case you missed it in the earnings frenzy, online food ordering and delivery platform GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) reported blowout third-quarter earnings. The fourth-quarter guide also came in healthily above expectations. GRUB's stock soared.This is nothing new for the stock, which is on fire because digital food ordering and delivery is the biggest trend in the QSR space. The stock is up 60% year-to-date and is significantly outperforming market darlings Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) over the past 12 months.Can this run higher continue? We think so. Although we mistakenly went from bullish to neutral on the stock after it crossed $45 following a stellar Q1 report, we have revised our growth estimates notably higher to account for much more robust market share gains than initially anticipated. Consequently, we now think a reasonable forward 12-month price target on GRUB's stock is $70.GRUB data by YChartsTo avoid sounding like a broken record, here is a quick synopsis of why the company is experiencing accelerated growth.Technology has given birth to the era of the at-home economy. Instead of going to malls, you shop online. See Amazon's stock versus Macy's (NYSE:M) stock. Instead of going to the movies, you watch streaming content at home. See Netflix's stock versus AMC's (NYSE:AMC) stock. Instead of going out to eat, you order food in. See GrubHub's stock versus DineEquity (NYSE:DIN) stock.AMZN data by YChartsNFLX data by YChartsGRUB data by YChartsThe charts say everything. This trend is secular in nature, and it's not going anywhere anytime soon.The concern with GrubHub then isn't market growth but rather that elevated competition will erode GRUB's benefits in a rapidly growing market. Over the past several quarters though, GRUB has put those competition concerns to rest by going on a buying spree. This year alone, GrubHub has acquired three of its smaller competitors: Foodler, Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) OrderUp, and Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) Eat24.The expanded GRUB ecosystem has awarded the company robust revenue growth potential and a massive moat against competitors like Postmates, Amazon, Uber (NYSE:UBER), and now Facebook. The enhanced presence of GRUB in the rapidly growing online food ordering and delivery marketplace has forced us to revise our growth estimates upward.GRUB's revenues were up 32% last quarter, are up 34% so far in 2017, and are expected to grow about 38% this year. That laps 36% revenue growth last year and 43% the year before. Clearly, this growth story isn't slowing down all that much, and it won't slow down all that much into the foreseeable future because of secular trends pushing forward online food ordering adoption. Consequently, we put revenue growth over the next two years at 35% per year. Margins are currently under pressure, and we see that pressure continuing as GRUB will need to spend big to grow big. Therefore, we think that 35% revenue growth will turn into 30-35% earnings growth over the next two years (32.5% at the midpoint).GRUB's stock currently trades at 53x fiscal 2017 earnings estimates. A 53x multiple for 32.5% growth is fairly reasonable. It equates to a PEG (P/E divided by growth) profile of about 1.6. The market has a PEG profile of about 1.8 (19.6x 2017 earnings for 11% projected growth). Therefore, GRUB's stock is more attractively valued than the market.Let's extrapolate this out. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020, growth rates will slow. We think earnings growth in that time frame will look like 25-30% (versus 30-35% for fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2019). Give GRUB stock a market-standard 1.8 PEG profile. That implies a ""fair"" P/E multiple of about 50x. GRUB's fiscal 2018 earnings should look something like $1.40 (Street sitting at $1.46). A 50x multiple on a $1.40 implies a 12-month forward price target of $70.We think that is where the stock will trend over the next 12 months. Secular tailwinds remain in place for growth to continue to impress. Plus, this company is a relatively full tax payer that will stand to benefit tremendously if corporate tax rates do fall."
4116780,22148,2017-10-26T10:43:25-04:00,GrubHub surges following strong revenue guidance for Q4.The market appears to misunderstand the inclusion of Eat24 numbers into the estimates.Solid financial metrics support the effective handling of competition.Stock valuation remains a question as EBITDA will trail sales growth in 2018.,"In no real surprise, GrubHub (GRUB) easily fought off competition during Q3. As the company integrates recent acquisitions, the bigger issue is valuation now that the online food order and delivery service added debt to the balance sheet and boosted sales.The stock ended up 11% on the exceptional Q3 results to trade at new highs above $57. Can the new acquisitions add enough value to alter my investment thesis that GrubHub needs to pause at these levels?The biggest issue with analyzing GrubHub is attempting to factor in the valuation versus the updated expectations after buying Foodler, OrderUp, and Eat24 in the last couple of months. The company beat Q3 estimates about in-line with previous quarter levels, but some of the excitement over the stock on initial trading is related to the Q4 guidance versus estimates that don't accurately include the deals.GrubHub provided the following guidance for Q4 that includes the first full quarter of results from the three acquisitions other than Eat24 that didn't close until October 10.The key number is that expected revenue jumps to $200 million while analysts were down at $183 million. This number, no doubt, suggests analysts weren't factoring in the revenues from the deals including Eat24 that had some $17 million in quarterly revenues as part of Yelp (YELP), according to the recent filing.Most notable is that Yelp produced a sizable loss on that $17.3 million quarterly revenue run rate. Eat24 had roughly $21.5 million in quarterly expenses. A lot of the marketing and product development costs can be paired back to meet the goal of GrubHub to reduce the impact to breakeven during Q4.The updated Q4 EBITDA estimates of $51 to $56 million versus the previous analyst estimate of $51.2 million show that integrating these businesses will take a while to produce actual financial benefits. In fact, Eat24 will take until late 2018 to see synergy benefits while Foodler and OrderUp were hard cut over to the GrubHub platform and already are included in estimates.The updated GrubHub guidance does suggest that most of the revenue hike for Q4 is related to including Eat24 numbers and not any big boost in expectations.Longer term, the numbers continue to show that competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) or other industry players aren't impacting results. Not to mention, the company is even partnering with Facebook on the food ordering rollout on that social network.GrubHub remains highly profitable as the vast amount of competition fluctuates, but the company benefits from massive scale of 75,000 restaurants on the multiple platforms and nearly 10 million diners in Q3. The adjusted EBITDA per order continues to rise hitting a record of $1.54 during Q3, up from $1.48 during Q2. This number is probably the best indication that competition isn't a problem.Since the three deals were for cash, the financial impact is a reduced net cash position combined with higher revenues per share. The company now has $200 million of debt on a credit facility. GrubHub ended last quarter with 88.5 million shares outstanding so the market valuation is now roughly $5 billion.The key to valuing the stock is normalizing the revenue targets for 2018. Based on Q4 guidance, GrubHub is closing in on an annualized run rate in the $800 million range even considering Q4 is a seasonably strong period. A simple 25% growth rate in 2018 places the company on a path toward $1 billion in annual revenues.GrubHub has a limited net cash balance so the stock trades at roughly 5x sales estimates and similarly at the same EV/S multiple. Not an expensive multiple considering the growth rate though the stock trades at some 28x an EBITDA target of $175 million for this year. The inclusion and integration of Eat24 will cause some heartburn on the profit figures and won't provide a lot of benefits for the first year.The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub is reasonably priced. Due to the stock hitting new highs, GrubHub likely trades up into the mid-$60s range though the risk/reward equation doesn't favor aggressively buying the shares here outside of a trade. The company is effectively fighting off competition but integration hiccups with Eat24 could eventually ding the stock in 2018."
4115613,103773,2017-10-23T18:54:08-04:00,"GrubHub is expected to announce earnings before market open on Wednesday, October 25.Q3-17 earnings numbers are less important; the guidance from recently closed acquisitions will drive the stock price.My analysis indicates that the acquisitions alone will add 15-20% to the 2018 revenue and EPS.GrubHub has a recent history of earnings beat, guidance raise, and a positive stock reaction.","When GrubHub (GRUB) announces its 3rd quarter earnings before the market opens on October 25, I expect the guidance from recently closed acquisitions to drive the stock price. My analysis indicates that the recent Eat24, Orderup, and Foodler acquisitions will add 15-20% to the 2018 revenue on top of 20-25% organic growth. The revenue/EPS beat or miss in the seasonally weak Q3 will be a secondary factor.Along with Q2-17 earnings call, GrubHub announced the acquisition of Eat24 (Yelp's food delivery platform). A few days prior the company had announced the acquisitions of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) Orderup and Boston-based Foodler. These acquisitions were expected to close by the end of 2017. However, GrubHub issued a press release on October 10 that it closed the acquisitions much sooner than anticipated. No update on Q4-17 or 2018 guidance was given. Also, none of the sell-side analysts have updated their models since the closure.Investors will be more focused on hearing the commentary around the recent acquisitions - how much will those add to the revenue, the gross food sales, and the number of active diners. Also, when will the integration complete, and when will the benefits from the acquisitions start showing up in the income statement.GrubHub has a long history of making acquisitions and an excellent track record of integrating them onto the GrubHub platform. I believe this time will be no different, and expect that benefits will start to accrue in early 2018, if not sooner.It's possible that the management may guide Q4-17 that includes the recent acquisitions, or it may punt it to the following earnings call with the caveat that it takes a few months to integrate, understand the overlaps, etc. Even if no hard data is provided, I expect there will be enough hints to help the sell-side to update their models. See below for my analysis on how I expect the sell-side models to change, and how the consensus to be revised upwards.Based on the Q2-17 earnings call transcript, I believe that the acquisitions alone will add 15-20% to the 2018 revenue and earnings. This is in addition to the organic 20-25% growth that was already factored in the 2018 numbers. I base the acquisition-related 15-20% upside on the following data:To get additional perspective on what Q3 earnings might entail, I also looked at the last two earnings calls.In Q1-2017, GrubHub beat consensus expectations and raised guidance, and the stock price gapped higher (emphasis added):In Q2-2017, it was a repeat - the company beat consensus expectations, raised guidance, and the stock price gapped higher (emphasis added):Some of the acquisition-related information may already be reflected in the stock price (note it jumped 15-20% in the two days following the last earnings call and then has fallen over 10% from its high), but I expect that as the data of the acquisitions is confirmed by the management, the stock price should regain the lost ground from its recent high. I would be a buyer of the stock ahead of the earnings call."

Alongside results that broadly met expectations, GrubHub announced the acquisition of Eat24 for $288m, well over double what Yelp (NYSE:YELP) paid for it in February 2015. This may seem to a huge premium. But when one looks at what Eat24 can bring to GrubHub, it is not difficult to make the case that this could be the most important move GrubHub has made in its history.GrubHub is an online marketplace where diners come to order and have delivered food from participating restaurants. As an online marketplace (network business) it is subject to exactly the same dynamics as ride hailing, classifieds and so on. Twenty months ago we proposed a rule of thumb that states: A company that relies on the network must have at least 60% market share or be at least double the size of its nearest rivals to begin really making profit. In effect, by hitting one of these two criteria the marketplace becomes to the go-to place to transact meaning that buyers become somewhat less price sensitive and sellers will pay more to sell their goods there. It is this that allows the marketplace to make proper money but before this level is reached all players will almost certainly be under excruciating pressure. GrubHub is no different in that since the advent of UberEats and Amazon's entrance into this space, there has been relentless pressure on margins.In the last 12 months EBIT margins have fallen to 13.9% in Q2 17A from 18.7% in Q2 2016 despite a 32% increase in revenues. GrubHub is the market leader with 34% but Uber (NYSE:UBER) is not that far behind with 20%, Eats24 with 16% and Amazon on 11% (Cowen &Co). Regulatory scrutiny has been high on GrubHub's previous acquisitions but the fact that this deal is likely to be passed with barely a ripple is an indication of how much more competitive the market is now considered to be. There is some overlap between GrubHub and Eats 24 but importantly once combined the platform will have 75,000 unique restaurants on its books and 48% market share of transactions. Assuming that the acquisition and integration proceeds flawlessly, then GrubHub will be more than double the size of its nearest rival (Uber) and able to at least stabilize its margins. Furthermore, as long as it can hold onto this advantage, it should be able to withstand the pressure from its rivals despite the fact that they have very big brothers backing them up. Consequently, GrubHub had to make this acquisition otherwise it faced being ground down by its better financed rivals until it was forced to sell itself to one of them.GrubHub has made the right strategic move to ensure its longevity but now it comes down to execution to determine its future.Disclaimer - Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The online food ordering and delivery company has seen a massive rally off the 2016 lows. My investment thesis has long supported a bright future for the stock while dismissing the threats from big competitors. GrubHub starts the day trading near $56 with a market valuation approaching $5 billion.Analyst Paul Bieber actually bumped up his price target to $53 from $50 on the Neutral call. By his estimate, GrubHub is now worth 39x EPS estimates. Part of the call is that the integration of the Eat24 platform bought from Yelp (YELP) will constrain EBITDA benefits from the acquisition in 2018. His guidance is for a wide EBITDA improvement from Eat24 and other deals of anywhere from only $18 million to possibly up at $58 million. On the flip side, Morgan Stanley is more bullish due to the company's ability to leverage the scale to generate an additional $80 million in 2018 EBITDA. Analyst Brian Nowak only places a $59 target on the stock and that's the problem with buying GrubHub up here. The stock is now one of the few that trade above the average analyst target. Analysts on average value GrubHub at the same price as Credit Suisse around $53 implying 6% downside from the closing price on Monday. Source: Yahoo Finance GrubHub will soon be in the process of integrating Eat24 after buying the online ordering and delivery platform from Yelp back in August. The deal involves GrubHub paying $287.5 million in cash for Eat24 and the two companies completing a partnership involving integrating online ordering from GrubHub on the Yelp website. In addition, GrubHub bought certain assets of OrderUp from Groupon (GRPN) and entered into a similar partnership to handle the online food delivery for the Groupon platform. As well, GrubHub bought privately held Foodler that adds further to platform integration risks. The market rightfully bought GrubHub up on these deals that help consolidate GrubHub as the market leader offering online food ordering and delivery to 75,000+ restaurants. In the process, the company has forged relationships with two powerful platforms to drive future growth. The big unknown is the financial impacts of these deals. Hard for one to estimate how many customers will order food online from the Yelp and Groupon platforms. What investors do know is that the majority of the $18.4 million transaction revenues in Q2 for Yelp were related to Eat24. An annual revenue run rate of about $70 million will bump the 2017 revenue run rate for GrubHub to $725 million or more from the current $656 million target. GrubHub only guides to EBITDA of $175 million in the current year so using either analyst estimate provides a big boost to 2018 numbers. A reasonable 25% bump in 2018 would bring EBITDA up to roughly $220 million prior to these acquisition benefits that mostly fall to the bottom line as the deals utilize cash and cheap debt. Using a mid-point benefit of $50 million, the EBITDA target for 2018 would jump to $270 million. The key investor takeaway is that GrubHub trades at nearly 20x EBITDA targets for 2018 assuming major acquisition and partnership benefits. A more simpler way to value the stock is to assume a 20% boost the the $1.37 EPS target for 2018. The stock would trade at 35x an EPS target of $1.64 suggesting GrubHub is due for a pause."
4075030,22148,2017-05-21T06:14:38-04:00,GrubHub dipped on news that Facebook was moving forward with online food ordering and delivery services.Facebook has not shown any ability to make these initiatives work in the past.Investors should use any dip from this fears as an opportunity to own GrubHub.,"GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) initially sold off on Friday following a news report that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was moving aggressively into online food ordering and delivery. Concerned investors should review the recent quarterly results realizing that the market has long been flooded with competition with little impact to the results.The stock recently peaked near the all-time high back in 2015. Is Facebook entering the sector really enough to prevent a rally to new highs?According to TechCrunch, Facebook has implemented a ""Order Food"" option in the main navigation menu. The giant social network is working with Delivery.com and Slice for select test markets.The goal is to allow users to order food directly from the Facebook pages of the restaurants and have their partners fulfill the orders. The company though has a weak history of developing payments and fee based services.Consumers and partners haven't shown a desire to work with Facebook or utilize the social network for transactions. Over the last two years, revenues from payments and other fees are in constant decline mode. Q1 revenues were down $51 million or 23% from two years ago.CEO Jon Steinberg of Cheddar made the following statement regarding partnering with Facebook in the delivery of content from his new media network.In essence, Facebook isn't viewed as a good partner. For this reason and the relationships with restaurants already established by GrubHub in a competitive environment, shareholders probably have no reason to fear this Facebook initiative.For Q1, GrubHub grew revenues by 39% and EBITDA surged 32%. Daily Average Grubs were only up 21%, but revenues are surging from combining delivery with what was originally only online orders.Possibly most interesting is that GrubHub guided to Q2 revenues of up to $161 million which is nearly equal to what the massive platform of Facebook generates from revenues for games and other fees.The real question is whether one wants to pay $3.7 billion for GrubHub with a revenue target of $650 million for 2017. The stock isn't exactly cheap trading at nearly 6x forward revenues.The key investor takeaway is one should never completely ignore the threat from a platform the size of Facebook, but the social network giant has shown no ability to turn these transaction initiatives into strong businesses. Use any dip to own GrubHub that continues to dominate the sector."
4082570,29761,2017-06-20T08:28:22-04:00,There is speculation that Amazon is interested in acquiring GrubHub.GrubHub's most recent earnings call showed revenue increasing by 39% and EPS increasing 78% YoY.Despite its recent performance Grubhub's gross margins have been shrinking and we see too much competition in this market to consider investing in GrubHub.,"In case you have been living under a rock for the past few days, you have probably heard that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to acquire Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) in a deal worth $13.7 billion. The Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods makes a lot of sense. Amazon has completely changed the world of retail. It has put a stranglehold on the brick and mortar and mall based retailers such as Macy's (NYSE:M) and Sear's (NASDAQ:SHLD), and evolved retail into a ""stay at home"" activity. Now many think Amazon may be on its way towards changing the way we buy and order food.The ""stay at home"" economy is here, and like it or not this trend is only going to continue. Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) were some of the first companies to recognize and benefit from this trend. These companies all positioned their businesses to reach customers from the comfort of their home.Now another player, emerging from the ""stay at home"" economy has entered the conversation as a potential takeover target for Amazon; this company is GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Is this just speculation at this point and is it worth buying shares of GrubHub on this news?GrubHub is a mobile app based platform that provides an online takeout food platform for consumers to order from diners and restaurants. GrubHub is a middle-man, the firm generates revenue by charging restaurants a commission based on each order amount and by charging consumers a delivery fee.Since going public in 2014, GrubHub's stock has seen ups-and-downs. After falling below $20 per share in early 2016, the stock has regained momentum and run up over 130%; recently closing above $45 after the Amazon takeover speculation surfaced.GrubHub is far from just a speculative company. It is the market leader in a fast growing online takeout sector. After a merger with Seamless in 2013, GrubHub has been on a tear with both revenue and EPS growing rapidly.On April 27, 2017 the share price jumped over 18% after its Q1 earnings call showed revenue increasing by 39% and EPS increasing 78% YoY. Despite the strong earnings report we remain skeptical.The problem with GrubHub as an investment is that no matter how attractive the growth is, the company is defenseless. Although GrubHub has a developed marketplace network of restaurants and users, in our opinion, it is only a matter of time before competition hits this market and shrinks margins. In a survey conducted by Slice Intelligence (an independent digital commerce activity measurement company) with more competition in this market, GrubHub's market share has already declined more than 21% in less than two years to approximately 62%. Since going public, we have already seen GrubHub's gross margins shrinking year after year.Source MorningstarCompetitors to GrubHub already include Amazon, Doordash, and UberEats, and with a total addressable market size for online takeout projected at $200 billion and growing at a CAGR of 35%, there will likely be much more competition. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has already announced its intentions to enter this market.Our Take:Despite the potential attractiveness GrubHub possesses, we are steering clear of this stock. In the market, it's eat or be eaten. Unfortunately for GrubHub, we do not see the company having a sufficient moat to fend off competition from the other tech giants. Receiving a takeover bid from Amazon would be the best case scenario for GrubHub, but we do not suggest buying a company on the hopes and dreams of a takeover bid.

4067466,103077,2017-05-01T12:15:29-04:00,"Net income for the online food delivery service was $17.7 million, or 0.20 per share, for a 79% increase from $9.9 million a year earlier.Q1 marketing spend was $35 million on $156 million in revenue, or 22% with respect to revenue.Shares surged 22% on the earnings beat and high short interest.","GrubHub (GRUB) investors can breathe a sigh of relief as the company reported its ""best quarter ever"". The online food delivery service beat on both the top and bottom lines. The beat caused a surge in shares by 22%. GrubHub's beat comes from driving new diners through strategic marketing and extending services to smaller tier markets.GRUB data by YChartsFundamental AnalysisGrubHub beat earnings expectations by $0.05 as net income rose to $17.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. The beat came on revenue of $156.1 million. Revenue and earnings saw double-digit growth at 78% and 39% from a year earlier.The number of active diners, or customers, rose to 8.75 million for a 21% growth rate from a year earlier. All of this occurred despite lower spending on marketing as a percentage of revenue. GrubHub's marketing costs were $28.8 million on $112 million, translating to 25% of revenue. Q1 2017 marketing spend was $35 million on $156 million, only 22% of revenue. GrubHub outlined new marketing campaigns and was able to deliver overall growth without sacrificing financials.This sort of double-digit growth across the spectrum is what an investor likes to see from a growth company. GrubHub now trades at 77x trailing twelve-month earnings. The company boosted the lower bound of fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance by $12 million to $632 million.GrubHub Spreads its TerritoryAnother key takeaway was the company's success in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. The tiers include smaller cities, regions, and towns across the U.S. Growth in these unsaturated markets grew at twice the rate of the more saturated Tier 1. This is promising as GrubHub has cited these smaller regions as the core driver of future growth.Gross food sales tallied $898 million for the first quarter. A valuable selling point to new clients is evident as restaurants that have stayed loyal to GrubHub have realized 10% growth in gross food sales. This last metric is a great indication for what is to come in push, increasing more restaurants delivery capabilities. This point will spur more growth in the signing of larger restaurant chains. Existing restaurants partners continue to expand. GrubHub ran pilot services on Subway and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), which have signed on 750 and 100 restaurants in the most recent quarter, respectively.CEO Matthew Malloney made a great statement during the conference call that does a great job of summarizing GrubHub's performance in the first quarter:The story only gets better when looking at the cost of operations and support. Operations and support is an expense which includes the cost of independent contractors. This will be a key number to watch going forward as the cost of providing drivers that work for GrubHub, not the restaurants, will become the norm. This expense grew to $59.5 million, which is a 70% increase from the $35 million a year earlier, rising to 22% of Q1 2017 revenue. This is compared to $35 million, or 31% of revenue, from a year earlier. This may become an issue as GrubHub claims to offer the lowest cost option among a plethora of competitors.The fact that this number decreased as a percentage of overall revenue is a positive.Reason for the Spike and Possible HeadwindsGrubHub reported a monster quarter while its stock was being shorted at a very high rate. Short interest as a percentage of float was 21% going into earnings. Combine this statistic with a strong fundamentals beat and high institutional ownership, then the resulting 22% share appreciation makes a lot of sense.One of the biggest headwinds is competition. Strong competitors do exist in this space already, examples include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). Amazon Restaurants, the name for Amazon's delivery service, currently offers one hour delivery from 150 popular food chains and restaurants. The one hour limit shows Amazon wants to meet customer satisfaction with quality control. GrubHub deliveries can sometimes take in excess of one hour. This is okay for now, but as expectations rise with competition, the drive to be the more efficient service will be the real winner and could squeeze margins to compensate for longer wait times. The lesser of the two evils is still unclear.UberEATs, subsidiary of Uber, just recently partnered with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Other examples of threats to GrubHub's leading market share are found in recent partnerships from The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) teaming up with Doordash and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA). Panera Bread announced the hiring of 10,000 drivers. All of this points to an extremely competitive landscape going forward while pointing to the demand for food delivery.ConclusionGrubHub did deliver a strong quarter. Some of the appreciation is objectively due to this, but at 21% short interest prior to the beat, it may not be the best time to initiate or add shares. Investors could hedge some market volatility by adding shares through put options at a strike price with a more favorable P/E."
4093227,22445,2017-08-01T13:56:51-04:00,"The deal announced by Groupon and Grubhub is a win-win for both companies.However because Groupon is very undervalued in my mind, I think Groupon's stock will benefit more.In addition, this might be a preamble to a buyout of Groupon, that will probably happen at a substantial premium to today's price if it happens.","In a surprise move Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) and Grubhub (NYSE: GRUB) announced a strategic partnership to bring food delivery to Groupon customers throughout the United States. As part of the deal, Groupon and Grubhub have entered into a commercial agreement that will allow Groupon to provide users with the ability to order food delivery from Grubhub's 55,000 restaurant partners via the Groupon platform and is expected to enable people to redeem Groupon deals when they order Grubhub delivery via Groupon.Obviously this was a surprise, as these two companies are fierce competitors in the food deliver business. The question is, who will benefit from this deal, and who's stock will benefit most?To begin with let me say I follow both companies. I have had a buy and sell rating on GRPN on and off several times (link here), and I have always had a sell and short rating on GRUB (link here).The way I see it, GRPN is an extremely undervalued stock, and GRUB an inflated bubble (more on this below). So assuming the synergies will benefit both companies, by virtue of the fact that I think GRPN is undervalued, I think GRPN's stock will benefit more from this partnership.Another thing to keep in mind is while both companies offer food delivery (with GRUB being the leader in the space), GRUB is only a food deliver service and nothing else. GRPN on the other hand is a market-place company.GRPN's platform has the ability to offer many different types of deals across many different markets. GRUB's platform on the other hand is simply on order deliver system hooked up to thousand of restaurants and nothing else.As Maloney, CEO of GRUB said in the press release:So in my mind, GRUB probably needs GRPN more than GRPN needs GRUB. GRPN's platform will probably allow GRUP's restaurant customers to offer deals and special offers to a very wide customer base, which is not possible today with GRUB's platform.Now having said all this, this deal might be a preamble to a merger between the two companies. I the back of my mind, GRUB probably wants to see if GRPN's platform will benefit GRUB before it makes a move.Please note that if I were the CEO of GRUB, I too would want to use my very expensive stock price to try buyout another company that will complement my business.As a reminder, GRUB trades at a trailing Price/Sales ratio of 7.5 and a trailing P/E of about 71. Granted GRUB is forecasted to grow about 20% in 2018, however a forward P/E of about 37 is simply too rich for me.GRUB data by YChartsGRUB's stock has been up and down over the past 3 years because it is such an expensive stock. Please note revenue and profit growth is very strong, however that is already reflected in the stock's price and by a huge premium. In my opinion GRUB is still too rich and the price of the stock is still playing catch-up with revenue and profit growth.GRPN on the other hand has no trailing profits, however it trades at a Price/Sales of 0.7.GRPN Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsAnd granted that GRPN is not growing by much, however I will bet my money on a company like GRPN that is trading below 1X sales and in the middle of a restructuring, than risk paying 37 a times forward multiple.And if such a merger or buyout were to happen, I doubt very much GRPN would be sold for less than $4 billion (or about 100% higher than where the stock stands today). At least if I were a major shareholder that would be my minimum price.So besides the synergies, there is a small chance that GRPN is bought out in the future, with GRPN shareholders doubling their money over the next several quarters or so.This is a win-win deal for both companies. However, because I think GRPN is a very undervalued company, I think GRPN's stock will benefit more than GRUB's stock.In addition, this might be a preamble to a buyout of GRPN, which might mean huge gains for today's GRPN shareholders."
4067288,73185,2017-05-01T00:14:13-04:00,"GRUB stock popped on strong Q1 earnings.By multiple metrics, it was the best quarter GRUB has ever had.The long-term growth narrative is as strong as ever, supported by secular industry growth, Tier 2 and 3 market expansion, and national chain adoption.The stock now feels fully valued, and we think it is a good time to take some profits off the table.We will look to buy significant dips.","As we predicted, shares of GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) soared after the company reported much better-than-expected Q1 earnings. The stock now trades near all-time highs. Although we believe in the GRUB growth narrative, we think the valuation here is stretched and believe it to be a good time to take profits. All else equal, we will look to buy back in on significant dips.GRUB data by YChartsThe company really is firing on all cylinders right now despite all the talk of increased competition. GrubHub just had its best quarter in company history in terms of organic Active Diner net adds, and it did so while keeping unit acquisition costs flat sequentially. GrubHub also just had its best quarter in company history in terms of restaurant adds, so growth is happening in similar accelerating fashion on both sides of the equation (consumers and restaurants). That is crucial for parity in the company's business model.New market expansion is progressing very well, as the number of markets with Daily Average Grub volume in excess of 1,000 boomed to 28, from 22 last quarter. That is nearly 30% growth Q/Q.It is also good to hear that GrubHub has a particularly sticky core user base. Active Diners acquired in January 2013 placed more orders on the platform in March 2017 than they did in March 2016. That says that once people try GrubHub, they get hooked, and they use the platform more and more as the number of restaurant options grows.That makes adding restaurants extremely important to the GrubHub growth narrative. As CEO Matt Maloney described on the conference call, adding new restaurants really does create a ""rising tide that lifts all boats."" As more restaurants join the GrubHub ecosystem, Active Diner engagement will likewise increase. That will cause Daily Average Grubs to go up, and each restaurant will consequently receive more orders per day. It is a win-win-win situation. Consumers get food service more conveniently, restaurants increase e-commerce reach, and GrubHub makes more money. This is even true on a unit basis, as management commented on the call that commission rates are growing in line with marketplace growth.For all these reasons, GrubHub's current growth initiatives in adding more restaurants and growing its Tier 2 and Tier 3 city presence are exceedingly important to the long-term growth story. As we mentioned in our earnings preview article, GrubHub has a tremendous opportunity in catering to non-delivery-centric brands that are ceding market share to delivery-centric brands like Domino's (NYSE:DPZ).The call seems to affirm that GrubHub is capitalizing on this opportunity. The company has recently added TGI Fridays, Chili's, Maggiano's, and Rubio's Coastal Grill to the GrubHub platform, as well as extended partnerships with Subway, Red Robin, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), and Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN). Moreover, GrubHub's Tier 2 and 3 build-out is just starting, and there is plenty of growth ahead in those markets. Early ad campaigns across Tier 2 markets have played out quite well, and management noted that Tier 2 and 3 markets are growing twice as fast as Tier 1 markets.At the end of the day, the growth narrative for GRUB is extremely strong, so it comes to down to valuation. The stock currently trades around 45x LTM non-GAAP EPS of $0.98. That is a rich multiple, but there is also plenty of growth behind it. Revenues are on track to grow somewhere around 30% this year, not much of a deceleration from the 36% growth experienced last year. With secular tailwinds propping up market-wide online food ordering and delivery growth, GRUB should be able to grow revenues somewhere around 20% per year over the next 5 years (slightly better than the 15% projected market CAGR, representing expectations for some market share expansion due to big brand adoption).GRUB is experiencing opex leverage everywhere except for on the Operations and Support line, but revenue scale should eventually drive leverage there as well. With revenue growth set to largely outpace opex growth, we believe GRUB's 5-year forward earnings CAGR is somewhere around 25%.A 45x multiple for 25% growth isn't great, so we do think the stock has overshot itself a bit here. While we love the growth narrative, we believe it is an appropriate time to take some profits off the table and let the stock pullback before buying back in."
4064745,103077,2017-04-24T20:07:17-04:00,"Active diners grew 21% to 8.17 million. GrubHub's sales and marketing spending was reported as $110 million, 22% of overall revenue, for 2016. This expense will continue to grow.Growth strategies include making deals with chain and independent restaurants. Metropolitan areas are becoming saturated.GrubHub has a difficult business model and needs to maintain market share and establish long-term sustainability as competition grows.","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is the current leader in online and mobile takeout delivery. GrubHub is set to report on April 27th, 2017. A few topics that will be center stage for GrubHub include guidance on its marketing campaign, expansion into smaller markets, and its position with respect to the competition.FundamentalsGrubHub took a hit since its earning miss for Q4 2016 and traded lower by ~15%. Investors need not panic, as one quarter is hardly a trend. GrubHub trades at ~60x trailing 12-month earnings. Since the mild correction, a few inside trades have occurred. Most notable was the sale of 6,250 shares by CEO Matthew Maloney. This transaction came a week after Chief Marketing Officer Barbara Coppola executed the sale of another 2,000 shares.GRUB data by YChartsThe earnings miss occurred despite double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Net income increased 21% compared to a year earlier. ""Active diners"", the metric to measure buyers, grew 21% to 8.17 million. GrubHub missed earnings by $0.02. Net income grew 21% to $13.6 million.Last year's acquisition of LAbite supports the idea that it is very difficult for GrubHub to beat existing competition where partial saturation has occurred. This method of growth will drive up liabilities in the short term. Total long-term debt is back over $100 million. Competition is not guaranteed to halt in Los Angeles either, and the expected return on investment may not come to fruition.CompetitionGrubHub's management realizes that such competition is becoming an issue in an increasingly competitive industry. In the most recent 10-K filing, GrubHub outlined that the main competition comes from traditional offline ordering process via paper menus and over the phone infrastructure.Online competition is pretty daunting as it comes from marketplace behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and UberEATS. These companies are technologically savvy, have enormous war chest of cash, and optimized delivery networks already in place. Amazon has always been great at diminishing market share as a disruptor, such is the case with brick and mortar retail stores. Amazon offers its food delivery for free to Amazon Prime subscribers.The drive to sign on bigger restaurant chains appears to be challenging. Recent examples include The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) teaming up with DoorDash and Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) announcing the hiring of 10,000 drivers.In response to the competition, GrubHub is spending more on marketing. The recent hire of Barbara Coppola as chief marketing officer has come with an increase in marketing spending in order to drive new diners to try GrubHub. Again, it will be interesting how GrubHub will be able to keep brand loyalty. For fiscal year 2016, GrubHub's sales and marketing spending were reported as $110 million, 22% of overall revenue. This was up $19 million from a year earlier.What Investors Don't SeeAnother challenge for investors comes with seasonality. GrubHub states that a relative increase in ordering volume occurs from September to April. As colleges let out for the summer, coupled with no major sport season, a dip in orders occur from May until August.Whenever possible, an investor should attempt to try and use the product or service that one invests in. I believe it allows for increased knowledge and the ability for channel checking. Trying out GrubHub for a few weeks, something interesting happened. The GrubHub delivery was made by the restaurant's employee. On the third attempt, the employee handed me the restaurant's phone number and information. This effectively cut out GrubHub from future orders.Investors looking into the mobile and online delivery service may want to wait on GrubHub until it looks like current market share can grow and be sustained. The industry is growing fast. The second point drives the investor to the capital market. Investing in companies directly, such as the above mentioned Panera or Cheesecake Factory may be the better play. If this last point proves to be true moving forward, then the delivery for independent and chain stores will be the sole deciding factor for GrubHub's sustained market share and profitability."
4055276,75675,2017-03-15T05:26:54-04:00,GrubHub commission model is unsustainable.Missing a critical component.Competition encroaching on GRUB’s territory.,"We remain firmly short GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) as a best idea for the following three reasons:As a result, the company is going to get caught flat-footed.While Uber is investing in robotics to drive the future (more profitable) state of food delivery, GRUB is stuck flat-footed still investing to build out their human based delivery network. Making eating more convenient for the consumer is of the utmost importance, but making it profitable both for the restaurant and the delivery company is critical for the longevity of delivery. GRUB was the first on the scene in the aggregator/delivery business and they still have strongholds in major metros such as NYC, Chicago, LA, etc, but competition is not only nipping at their heels, they are eating market share. Take NYC for instance, the epicenter of takeout and delivery in the U.S. not only do many restaurants still handle their own delivery, GRUB is faced with increasing pressure from other delivery networks (DoorDash, UberEats, Postmates) as well as ghost restaurants (think Maple, Munchery, Ando). Simply put, they are no longer the only game in town, and GRUB is getting out innovated on all fronts.Instacart for instance, not technically a restaurant delivery company, specializes in delivering groceries from the likes of Whole Foods and Publix. Instacart just raised another $400M at a $3B pre-money valuation, with existing investors including Whole Foods likely returning for more. Instacart has plans to bring prepared foods from WFM to your doorstep. WFM has one of the best prepared food offerings of any national grocery store, so they are very well equipped as a partner with instacart to take on this market opportunity. This will just be yet another leech on GRUB's side.One of the bigger factors is the lack of profitability for restaurants on delivery orders, as well as the inability for one delivery provider to be able to service the entire network of larger restaurant chains. We believe Panera (NASDAQ:PNRA) is doing it right, by owning delivery it will enable them to control the process from start to finish and that includes the capturing of vital customer data. First on the data, the value in it cannot be underestimated, as getting email addresses and being able to track order trends allows companies to learn more to do targeted promotions and pivot away from things that are not working and move toward what is. Secondly, by owning that critical last mile, PNRA will be the sole party responsible for the delivery from collection to the doorstep, keeping the integrity of the brand in their hands.It's management's job to display the utmost confidence in their business and its future prospects, so we don't blame them for avoiding the thought that competition is actually affecting their business. But with that being said, we don't believe it for a second.Through many conversations we have had with restaurant operators being sick of GRUB and competition (UberEats and DoorDash), GRUB is winning less than they used to. This quarter, GRUB made it clear that future growth is going to come at an increased cost as they will aggressively increase marketing spend in 2017. Why the need for such aggressive marketing if competition is not encroaching? Going toe-to-toe against UberEats on marketing and promotional spend will come at an expense to profitability. If it does not yield intended benefits to growth, 2017 could turn into a very disastrous year.GRUB is piecing together their capabilities by acquiring businesses. In January they acquired a 40 person engineering and operations team from Zoomer, a small delivery logistics provider. They have done the same thing in the past to acquire drivers, via buying smaller local regional delivery players. Uber already has drivers everywhere; they just need to sign up restaurants and this is a major advantage as they look to grow beyond Tier 1 cities into Tier 2 & 3. GRUB claims to have best in class customer service, we have heard differently, and their lack of feet on the ground in Tier 2 & 3 cities will be an inhibitor to restaurant growth and retention.GRUB management is thinking about the model incorrectly in our opinion, saying on the 4Q16 earnings call that they have ""lower consumer-facing fees"" versus the competition. Having the lowest consumer facing fees is great in the near-term to acquire new diners. But what happens when you are more expensive than your competition on the restaurant side, and that leads to restaurants starting to quite your service in favor of a competitor that can offer a near identical experience at a lower cost? Losing restaurant partners is a far bigger problem; it's hard to deliver more food if the people cooking the food don't want to work with you!Importantly, sentiment around the name has the sell-side overly bullish at 67% of the analysts with buy ratings. On the other side the short interest declined significantly over the past year....and the CEO has been selling massive amounts of stock.This is how the GRUB story will unfold; growth will continue to come at an increasing cost in order to compete with sizable competition (UberEats primarily). This dynamic is evident in their very wide guidance range provided below, as top-line growth may not be joined by EBITDA growth, given the investments required to drive the top-line.GUIDANCE"

Although the market is saturated with competition like Uber Eats and Postmates, we believe the online and mobile food-ordering and delivery marketplace is growing quickly enough to largely offset competitive pressures. We like the stock here and believe the fundamentals support a higher share price.GRUB data by YChartsOur research suggests GrubHub had a strong quarter.GrubHub search interest continues to climb higher and has been particularly strong to start the year. Year-to-date, search interest in GrubHub has climbed 25% year-over-year. That is markedly stronger than the 21% year-over-year growth GrubHub search interest experienced in the last three months of 2016.Moreover, web traffic analytics site SimilarWeb shows that Grubhub.com traffic is trending up across the board. Grubhub.com is gaining web traffic share globally, domestically, and specifically among food and drink websites. Data from fellow web traffic analytics site Alexa corroborates positive SimilarWeb data. Specifically, Alexa shows a huge uptick in Grubhub.com traffic starting in March 2017.Longer term, we like the GrubHub story despite increased competition from newer players like Postmates, DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Amazon Restaurants. GrubHub has certainly benefited from a first-mover advantage, and that first-mover advantage will start to wear thin as newer players eat market share. But this is a rapidly growing pie. The global food delivery market is expected to grow at a 15% CAGR over the next five years.We don't see any risks to that secular market growth, either, as it ties in perfectly with other secular shifts. For example, if one thing is clear in the food industry, it is that delivery and at-home entertainment are two huge trends which go hand-in-hand. Investors need to look no further than the correlated outperformance of Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) over the past year to see evidence of this. As consumers increasingly opt to stay in and binge watch television shows on SVOD platforms, food delivery is growing in popularity. Domino's, which is a delivery-centric food service, has been a natural winner.NFLX data by YChartsBut not every big chain offers food delivery, and that is a huge long-term growth opportunity for GrubHub. As more and more food chains gravitate toward a delivery-centric consumer environment, more and more food chains will gravitate toward partnerships with GrubHub. This chain restaurant growth opportunity is a long-term revenue tailwind for GRUB.We also are fans of the current valuation, considering the bullish long-term growth prospects. The stock is trading around 60x trailing GAAP earnings, and that is a relative valuation trough. The last time GRUB's trailing GAAP P/E multiple languished at and below these levels, the stock staged a sharp rally from below $20 per share to above $40 per share in about six months.GRUB data by YChartsThe stock is now off those $40 highs, and we like the set up for a big move upward on positive earnings. The company has about $3.75 in net cash per share on the balance sheet (~11% of current market cap), and that cash balance is growing. GRUB also has strong operating cash flows with a relatively depressed capex line, so we like the company's free cash flow profile.We are bullish into the earnings, and will be interested in buying the dip if the stock sells off."

GRUB's projected growth runway will be eaten up by competing products from goliaths: Uber and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which can both offer lower prices to consumers and operate at zero profitability to steal market share. The pressures have already been reflected by increasing CAC and a 4Q16 earnings pullback for lower-than-expected margin guidance for 2017. We think this is just the tip of the iceberg.OverviewGRUB historically ran an online restaurant order aggregator in the US, primarily through the brands GrubHub and Seamless. Restaurants would place menus on GRUB's websites and customers would place orders through the online GrubHub portal. The company took ~15% of transaction value for obtaining the online customer order and routing it to the restaurant. The restaurant was responsible for delivery in this model, typically using a small local contractor. However, GRUB expanded its platform to include its own delivery fleet for restaurants. Use of this service requires an additional take of ~10% from the order total for restaurants. GRUB's fleet is paid near minimum wage by the hour - note that this necessitates an extra 15-20% tip for the driver, in addition to the delivery fee (which does not go to the driver). Currently GRUB connects 40,000+ restaurants and boasts 7.7+ million active diners.The company sees its primary growth runway in the combined routing & delivery business (commonly known as RDS - ""restaurant delivery services""). After a massive acquisition of the food delivery service Seamless, GRUB has spent ~$150mm acquiring four other RDS platforms in the past two years; namely, Restaurants on the Run, Delivered Dish, DiningIn, and LAbite. GRUB is focusing on Tier 1 and 2 cities (together, essentially all US cities with a major sports team).Bulls argue that the food ordering and delivery market penetration is still in early innings and that GRUB is the biggest player in the space. They also think that GrubHub's first-mover advantage is protected by its platform's ""network effect,"" locking in users and participating restaurants as the company grows. These investors reckon this network effect will allow GRUB to lead the race into an already lucrative market.Why we disagreeUn-defensible business model: A large part of GrubHub's stellar trailing growth has been due to lack of large competition in the market. However, there is absolutely no switching cost to any parties benefiting from an RDS platform.It's as simple as making an account or downloading an app, e.g. most people who have Uber on their phone also have Lyft. Same should go for GrubHub, UberEATS, Postmates, etc.GRUB and its competitors have made it extremely easy for restaurants to get on their platform. RDS companies simply give a tablet to their restaurants to manage their orders without any POS (point of sale) integration. This makes it easy for restaurants to be on multiple platforms. In fact, there is no cost to restaurants to list on multiple networks, as commission fees are on a per-order basis. Restaurateurs who buy into the model in fact prefer to be on all platforms - it is free marketing.This all means that when competition arrives, it will become an open-meritocracy that depends on smaller take rate to the restaurant, lower cost to the consumer, and performance of product (mainly delivery speed). There is little to suggest that customers or restaurants would stay exclusive with a particular platform for any other reason.Uber and Amazon crush GRUB in a meritocracy: The equity research sphere, as well as GRUB's management, has largely dismissed UberEATS and Amazon Prime Restaurants as currently negligible threats as they are in early stages. UberEATS launched in April 2015, expanding to eight US cities in 2015 and now in 35 US cities (and 58 worldwide). There is a year-plus lag between city entry and becoming a competitive threat in that market (strategy, restaurant acquisition, and user acquisition all take time), so Uber is a few quarters away from serious order volume outside of a handful of localities. UberEATS operates very similarly to GrubHub/Seamless, but utilizes its existing driver network for delivery. Amazon is in even earlier stages, launching in Sept. 2015 and currently in 19 US cities. Amazon relies on its Prime Now delivery network and packages the delivery service with the Prime membership, whereas UberEATS actually charges a delivery fee.However, we think these two players in fact pose a significant threat to all competitors, especially to the incumbent, GRUB. Uber and Amazon both trump GrubHub according to the RDS competition criteria outlined above.Amazon/Uber/GrubHub have equal take rate to the restaurant: All three services take around 25-30% of order subtotal - Uber at 30%, Amazon at 25%, and GrubHub at roughly 25% as detailed previously. After speaking to many restaurant owners/managers, we found this 5% discrepancy is generally viewed as nominal. If a good restaurant wants to use one platform, they typically will post to all of them. The benefit of marketing on multiple platforms outweighs ceding an extra 5% take for the restaurateur who believes in the RDS system. Therefore, material-volume restaurants will eventually be on all three, meaning consumer choice will drive order volume between platforms.All three platform list prices at in-restaurant menu prices. UberEATS currently charges a slightly higher delivery fee to the consumer than GRUB. However, GRUB drivers make most of their income through tips - hence, its online checkout layout aggressively suggests a 15%+ tip. UberEATS pays its drivers per delivery on top of guaranteeing a (much higher) hourly wage, so the Uber driver does not rely on tip. This means GRUB ends up with a ~10-15% higher total cost to customers over UberEATS (and Amazon, which charges no delivery fee).(Data Source: Company investor presentations as well as our own market research)As you can see from the chart above, we believe Uber's/Amazon's price advantage is a product of lower cost per delivery, not VC-esque cash burn. This is done through more effective driver utilization. Part of this is logistical prowess. Another part is that Uber and Amazon perform other services in off-peak hours (UberX and Prime Now delivery), whereas contracted GrubHub drivers wait around and fail to earn their necessary tips. Uber/Amazon also do not currently utilize batch delivery (delivering multiple items at once), which may become possible once their order volumes hit critical mass due to Uber's/Amazon's logistical expertise.All Uber/Amazon cost advantages will go to straight to lower cost to consumer, widening their price advantage under GrubHub. Both UberEATS and Amazon were built with the strategy of cornering market share by reinvesting all profits; our channel checks confirm they seek to do the same with RDS projects. GrubHub as a standalone company cannot compete in a zero-profit game, much less a negative-profit game from competing against Uber's/Amazon's lower per-delivery costs.UberEATS has slightly faster delivery times than GrubHub, due to its enormous driver network and logistical expertise (for easy evidence, see app reviews). AMZN is roughly the same as GRUB, but is still figuring out logistics. UberEATS already offers an equivalent service to restaurants and a superior service to consumers. When it reaches scale, we will see heavy impact via GRUB's earnings misses. If Amazon executes well, it has potential to inflict similar damage.Cracks already showing: UberEATS and Amazon Prime Restaurants have been aggressively promoting in their current cities. The stress of new competition is already showing:As the charts below show (Source - Left: GRUB Investor Presentation, Right: Our own models and metrics), competitors are making it significantly more costly for GRUB to maintain its growth numbers. GRUB's net CAC (incremental cost to acquire its next user, net of churn) has grown over 50% in the last year, from ~$54 in FY2015 to ~$85 in FY2016. Meanwhile, annual gross profit per user has stayed roughly flat over the last few years (around $40) despite increasing rev/order; this is due to declining orders per consumer. Its unit metrics disclosure is poor (no churn numbers and bad customer definitions...LTM users is a joke metric), but these indicators indicate a plummeting LTV/CAC. For a company expected to grow revenue over 30% while still growing EPS, this suggests one of those two will miss in coming quarters.Lack of confidence from CEO: Matt Maloney has sold ~50% of his share (sold ~1.5% of CSO) since June 2014. He has also publicly spoken about how ""dumb"" the delivery business is, saying in an interview with Forbes that he'd ""say [food delivery is] the dumbest business you could ever be in. Why run a break-even business?"". On the topic of Amazon and Uber, Matt Maloney commented during the 1Q16 earnings call saying that ""Uber and Amazon are the new boogiemen in the market. We also believe that having the lowest fees is critical…"". It is important to reiterate that GrubHub in fact does not have the lowest fees.Before moving on to the valuation, the last thing that might help to visualize how customers feel about GrubHub compared to its existing competitors. The chart below that we constructed by compiling app rates across both iOS and Android app stores speaks for itself:ValuationAt an EV of ~$3.0B, we are investing at 7.3x 2017 gross profit (at consensus 30% rev growth and 65% gross margins). On an intrinsic basis, the market implies growth of 22mm orders per year for the next 10 years assuming 12x terminal FCF multiple, 20% FCF margin (MS took GRUB public and recently upgraded GRUB. It projects 17%.), and stepping rev/order up from $5 to $6 during the 10-year period of growth ($25/order * 25% take rate = $6.25, round down because the aggregation-only business decreases average order revenue). Order growth has been declining from 18mm to 16mm orders from FY2014 to FY2016. We think pricing in 22mm growth is far too generous. I have included charts from our modeling below:We also think strong rev growth in coming years is highly unlikely without significant impact to EPS and cash flows (see GRUB customer acquisition troubles above). GRUB's premium valuation is predicated on its ability to generate strong earnings/cash flow and premium revenue growth in tandem; the current investor delusion that both can continue will fade. The most reputable software/Internet companies growing under 20% trade at 6x forward gross profit, suggesting a minimum 20% downside if the market continues to view GRUB as a strong business but realizes slow revenue growth. But as investors realize how Uber/Amazon will cause margin pressure far beyond what investors saw from the 4Q16 earnings release, we think there is further downside. We can see a scenario of 50% downside as GRUB dips to 3-4x forward gross profit (2-3x revenue) as these pressures are realized.Acquisition risk is also nearly zero, as GRUB has trivial network effect and the space has lower barriers to entry. The only acquisition purpose would be for the existing user base; however at ~$370 EV/customer and ~$40 annual gross profit/customer, the pricing is expensive. Lyft, for example, would be better off simply making an app like Uber did instead of purchasing a platform at this exorbitant price.Given all of this, we are very bearish on GrubHub and recommend shorting it. Since its last earnings disappointment, the share price has indeed dropped and the cost of puts has increased, but we believe there is still significant downside for GrubHub as the market begins to bake in all the factors surrounding the company.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4043123,22445,2017-02-06T19:18:24-05:00,"While GrubHub is a very solid company with excellent growth, nevertheless it’s a very expensive stock.Analysts think GrubHub will be a prime beneficiary of a lower tax rate.While indeed GrubHub will benefit, the data shows that even after a lower tax rate, GrubHub is still too rich.","In my previous article on GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), I said that while this is a first rate company, with great growth and a solid balance sheet, I thought the stock was way too expensive, and my rating was a sell (please consider: GrubHub: Great Company, But Is The Stock Worth It?).Like I said back then, the stock was way ahead of company fundamentals, and as a result I thought the stock would underperform. In fact, I specifically said I expect GRUB to underperform for many years.As the chart above depicts, GRUB has been one of the stocks that missed the current rally. To be honest, I am not blaming management in any way. The fault is with the market for giving GRUB such a high valuation.Is GRUB a Trump-trade stock?While every company will benefit if taxes are lowered, not all companies will benefit the same.Companies who do most of their business in the U.S. pay up to 40% of their profits in taxes. So if taxes are lowered to 20% for example, then EPS will increase dramatically for many companies. This is indeed true for GRUB.The above table shows the income before tax, tax expense and net income as reported for GRUB. As you can see, in many instances the tax paid is above the 40% rate.Below the net income row, I have added two rows. The one row says tax expense at 20%, and depicts the tax the company would pay under a 20% tax rate, and below that the net income.In the first case, total net income for the past four quarters was $47,2 million, while in the second case with a 20% tax rate, net income increased to $61 million.Indeed that is a big difference, but will it be enough for the stock to rally? I think not. Here's why.GRUB's current market cap today is $3.5 billion. If we divide $47 million by that figure, the stock has a trailing P/E of about 74. That is a very rich P/E folks (and it's the same number shown on Yahoo for trailing P/E).If we divide the market cap by $61 million (the 20% tax rate figure), then the trailing P/E is lowered to 57! Folks, that's still a very rich number.So in my opinion, even if the tax rate is lowered to 20%, GRUB would still be a very expensive stock, and I do not think a lower tax will benefit the stock by much. If there is any benefit, it will probably be a one time uptick.And given how many other companies also operate in the same space, I am surprised the market still gives GRUB such a high valuation.Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) with Ordeup also is in the same space, as is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its PrimeNow delivery service, and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) also is another major player in the space with its eat24hours.com site.However I'm not worried so much about competition. I think the market is big enough and there is room for all participants. My beef is simply that GRUB's growth comes at a very high price for my investment pallet.GRUB is set to announce Q4 results on the 8th of Frbruary. Analysts are modeling revenue of $492.4 million for 2016 and $619.5 million for 2017. EPS is expected to come in at $0.91 for 2016 and $1.15 for 2017.Yes these results are impressive, however investors have to realize that the market is charging a very extreme P/E for this growth.I therefore reiterate my sell rating for the stock. Not because it's not a solid company, but because it's still an expensive stock, even if the tax rate is lowered."
4029390,75045,2016-12-09T04:48:16-05:00,Politics are a third rail for major businesses.GrubHub's business model exposes them to extra risks most companies aren't exposed to.The company's strong Northeastern presence dilutes the risk of alienating Trump supporters to some degree.,"A company's primary decision maker, above all, must make good decisions.It's a truism, but one that bears repeating in a turbulent month following a heated and vicious presidential election. Tempers flared high during the surreal campaign, where the most sordid political dramas played out not on prime time television but in the real world. Donald Trump's dramatic victory stoked waves of panic and worse, as Hitlerlian hyperbole mounted on cable news networks and in pop culture.In the post-election chaos of the rioting coasts and the celebrating Midwest, it seemed as if any public figure with an opinion on the matter - no matter how trivial the opinion, or obscure the name - found a microphone in their face. If anyone had a burning desire to know how Ariana Grande felt about the new President-elect, one could read no fewer than four separate articles on the matter by the morning of the 9th.Sometimes these opinions or observations came at the cost of their own brand. Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams, also a trained persuasion artist and hypnotist, found his brisk business as a keynote speaker completely dry up following his apparent backing of Trump during the primaries and general election (a backing he is quick to disavow - he considers himself apolitical and says that his 'political viewpoints don't match either candidate'). For Adams, even writing on Trump's persuasion skills in a positive light - never mind his actual politics - was too toxic to his otherwise genial brand of cynical office humor.It's a fundamental human trait that the desire to speak our minds often trumps any number of survival instincts. As it turns out, CEOs are people too, and sometimes the primary decision-makers make an ill-advised decision to open their mouths. And as it turns out, alienating half of one's customer base is generally bad for business.GrubHub, PepsiCo, and Tony The TigerPerhaps one of the most cautionary tales was GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) CEO Matt Maloney's outburst in a corporate mail on November 9. Maloney's strong rhetoric was quickly picked up by Fox News and publicized. Shares crashed 8.7% in the next two days, falling from $38.68 to $35.31 in the aftermath of a storm of negative publicity.PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) CEO Indra Nooyi's sensationalist commentary the day after, speaking at a Dealbook conference in New York, broadly echoed the more calamitous predictions of the losing side. Shares dropped about 2% in the next few days.Tony the Tiger making America grrrreat again. Photo courtesy of Kellogg's.CEO digs on Trump haven't been limited to the candidate himself. Kellogg's (NYSE: K) decision to halt advertising on decidedly right-wing news site Breitbart prompted a Trump-esque retaliation from the publisher, and calls for a boycott were sounded loud and clear among the Trump faithful. And true to form, the already-sliding stock lost a few more percent off the top, as shares went from $73.62 on November 29 to close out at $70.96 on December 1.Sometimes it's not just the decision makers that ruffle feathers. These cautionary tales seem to have been lost on the writers of Disney's (NYSE: DIS) new Star Wars movie, Star Wars: Rogue One, who obliquely lashed out at the President-elect with a series of Twitter posts and a logo of the Rebel insignia with a safety pin through it. The apology that followed did little to smooth relations with angry Trump supporters. The damage had been done.What This MeansA few things spring to mind when reviewing these cases. First, it's often unclear what benefit - if any - taking a political stand serves for most companies outside of a few niche cases. A distinctly politicized company with narrow demographics - something along the lines of a Calvin Klein or a Trader Joe's - might not suffer much from a strong political stand. Ben and Jerry's made good business out of its genuinely fervent embrace of left-wing politics, generating goodwill among a generally young and urban customer base.But those cases are unique and incidental. More commonly, a company merely risks alienating a percentage of its customer base with strong political stances. Target (NYSE: TGT) found this out the hard way, as the company's April embrace of bathroom choice was followed by a brutal 19% drop in the following month, a drop most certainly correlated with a disappointing May 18 earnings report. To whatever extent that the earnings report reflected the effect of a customer boycott is unclear, but the company's decision to put politics before profits certainly made investors skittish.Furthermore, we can see the effects of the modern 24-hour news cycle. In each case, the drops directly attributable to politicized news for the companies we've looked at here (barring Disney, which is too big of a bucket for even Star Wars to make much of a splash) lasted for a 2-day period, after which old news was old news and investors moved on to more interesting topics.So, taking a political stance opens a company to risk of boycott and short-term stock losses. But GrubHub is a little bit of a different case.Why GrubHub Loses The MostGrubHub likely stood the most to lose. Already dealing with multiple smaller competitors, the online storefront is beginning to feel the strain of declining growth. But more importantly than that, GrubHub's unique business model exposes them to a particular risk.In ordinary circumstances, boycotts last as long as the customer is angry at the targeted company. That might be a matter of days, or weeks, or forever. The dolphin-tuna boycott of 1988-1990 was sustained by media attention and celebrity intervention. The Nike boycott of the 1990s undermined the value of the brand, threatening the company far beyond, however much was lost in revenue. In both cases, these boycotts led to seismic changes throughout the industry.But boycotts against companies with desirable products generally don't last long. While navigating a Target boycott might be difficult in certain regions (it's hard not to play the only game in town), and a Kellogg's boycott might last until Junior decides he needs Frosted Flakes right now, switching away from GrubHub is as simple as deleting GrubHub and installing a new app - and a competitor might even offer an enticing promotional offer for the honor. A Target customer has to be angry at Target every time they drive by Target on a shopping trip. A Nike customer has to be angry at Nike every time he or she goes to buy shoes at the store. Eventually, without an endless barrage of reminders, many customers lose their irritation at the targeted company. Life goes on. Boycotting a normal company is an ongoing decision.After installing a competitor's app, however, a former GrubHub customer now again has a button on their smartphone that delivers food to their home or work, just like before. In other words, a former GrubHub customer has to be angry once, just enough to delete the app and try something else, and then never think about it again. They may even forget why they don't use GrubHub. They just don't use GrubHub anymore, that's all. The customer's very human inertia against change - if something works, why change it? - will then keep them off of GrubHub unless GrubHub turns out to be so overwhelmingly superior of a service in the customer's local area that they put in the effort to switch back.Consequently, I posit that GrubHub's unique customer model exposes the company to greater risk of boycotts than normal, as it changes what is ordinarily an ongoing decision into a snap decision. To whatever extent the boycott is a success might be revealed in its next earnings report, but in terms of revenue only - the uninstalled customers will still be consider an 'active diner' for a period of 12 months after their last order. As it's unlikely that GrubHub would volunteer the number of angry emails and cancellation requests the company received - not that such information would be particularly valuable anyway, since the vast majority of boycotting customers would simply delete the app quietly - this would be the only indication that something was amiss at GrubHub. If the company reports lower revenue growth for the quarter than expected, it could be an indication that the boycott stung them.It's Not All Bad NewsIt's worth noting that the vast majority of GrubHub's service areas are large urban centers, which are typically strongholds for Democrat support that aren't going to be antagonistic toward Maloney's email. So it would be unrealistic to assume that 47% of GrubHub's customers are at risk of a boycott. GrubHub's customer base no doubt includes a great number of modestly affluent Republicans, but Kentucky and North Dakota aren't exactly first tier locations for the GrubHub brand. So, the damage is more limited than it would have been had Maloney backed Trump and trashed Clinton or (worse yet) Sanders.GrubHub's strong Northeastern presence mitigates the risk of offending Trump backers to some degree, as these states swung heavily for Clinton. Photo courtesy of GrubHub.Still, it's unwarranted risk for most companies, GrubHub included. And meaningless risk is something that companies should always try to avoid. One of the most interesting firings on 'The Apprentice' was when a contestant waived his exemption (a guarantee of not being fired) based on hubris rather than for any kind of tangible gain. Trump fired him that day.Now people will debate on whether Trump himself will follow his own advice now that he is tasked with the biggest decision-making job on the planet. But even if it doesn't result in one dollar in net loss for GrubHub, Maloney's emotional email was an unnecessary risk that he should have known to avoid. Politics are a third rail for big companies, and without material upside to be gained should be generally avoided. Sticking one's neck out for nothing is just not a good decision."
4044023,22148,2017-02-08T17:24:45-05:00,GrubHub reported mixed numbers as the company plans to boost revenues by ramping expenses.CEO headline risk remains a legitimate concern.The stock is expensive and faces tough resistance above $40.,"Back in November, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) was under pressure due to some questionable tweets from the founding CEO. At the same time, my previous research suggested the stock had reached expensive levels.The dip to $35 ultimately provided a buying opportunity as the stock is now at $40 even after the market initially sold the stock off following the Q4 results. Is now the time to load up on the GRUB?For Q4, GrubHub missed EPS targets despite an impressive revenue growth of nearly 38%. The company grew the gross food sales capture rate to 16.8% due to the growing amount of deliveries. Investors have to be comforted that the emails and tweets of the CEO didn't destroy business.The stock initially sold off as key EBITDA guidance disappointed despite the solid revenue growth targets. The biggest fear for awhile was that the market had tons of opportunities for expansion, but high competition would pressure margins.GrubHub isn't necessarily seeing pressure from margins as much as ramping up spending to expand customers beyond the 8.2 million active diners. The company plans to increase marketing expenses at possibly the high 20% growth rate due to spending more on national TV spots and expanding into more Tier 2 cities.As well, GrubHub bought Zoomer to add up to 40 engineers to help with driver network efficiency. These moves will pressure the EBITBA growth in 2017.At the same time, the stock is worth $3.5 billion. GrubHub trades at about 5.5x revenue estimates and 20x EBITDA targets for the year. The big problem is that the low-end EBITDA target only forecasts 13% growth, bringing up the long-dreaded margin fears. Whether the company is seeing competitive pressure from the likes of private Uber (Private:UBER) or just aggressively expanding costs, the end result is disappointing bottom line metrics.The CEO recently deleted his Twitter account following the fallout from his complaints on policies made by Trump. The volatile statements made by Matt Maloney remain a risk with or without him posting on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as he could make such statements to the media, directly to employees or use a different social platform that he thinks is more welcoming to his thoughts on the president.The key investor takeaway is that the stock is expensive for one still in spending mode. The CEO deleting his Twitter account shows his inability to communicate with customers, making me unwilling to pay up for this quality stock with headline risk."
4022547,23998,2016-11-11T12:57:31-05:00,"A lot of Americans are still heated after Tuesday's election. One of them, apparently, was GrubHub CEO Matt Maloney.Maloney suggested employees who supported Donald Trump should resign, sparking calls for a boycott of his company.He may have also exposed his company to legal liability. Given that GrubHub is a bit pricey to hedge, the prudent course may be to sell your shares instead.","Politics And Business Don't Always MixWe get it. GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) CEO Matt Maloney is unhappy about Donald Trump winning the election. A lot of people are. But in business, it usually doesn't make sense to alienate tens of millions of potential customers. Especially when it may be illegal.As the tweet above indicates, Maloney sent an email to employees suggesting those who supported Trump should resign. He later tried to walk it back, saying his email had been misconstrued, but the damage was done. By Thursday night, the hashtag #BoycottGrubHub was trending on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), featuring tweets such as this one:Mixing Politics And Business May Be Illegal In This CaseAs if potentially alienating tens of millions of Trump supporters weren't bad enough, attorney and conservative columnist Kurt Schlicter pointed out that the company may have opened itself up to legal liability under California Law:Why Sell? Why Not Just Hedge?Given the current cost of hedging this stock, the better way to limit risk here may be just to sell it. You'll get different results with different parameters, obviously, but below are a couple of representative hedges we pulled up with the Portfolio Armor iOS app on Thursday. What that app does is find the least expensive put options and collars to precisely limit your risk according to your specifications, but sometimes the least expensive hedge in those cases isn't compelling.Hedging GRUB With Optimal PutsThese, for example, were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of GRUB against a greater-than-15% drop by mid-June:The cost of that hedge was $5,200, or a whopping 14.02% of position value. Granted, that cost was calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts (you can often buy puts for less, at some point between the bid and the ask), but you don't want to pay close to that much to hedge, do you?Hedging GRUB With An Optimal CollarYou can lower the cost of hedging against a greater-than-15% decline if you're willing to cap your possible upside. We set the cap at 12% below, because that was the potential return over the time frame of the hedge implied by Wall Street's consensus 12-month price target for the stock, shown in the screen capture from Nasdaq, below.This was the optimal collar to hedge GRUB against a greater-than-15% drop by mid-June while not capping your possible upside at less than 12% by then:As you can see above, the put leg of the collar used the same strike as in the optimal puts, so the cost was the same, $5,200, or 14.02% of position value. But as you can see below, the income generated from the short call leg was $3,100, or 8.36% of position value.So the net cost was $2,100, or 5.66% of position value. Similar to the situation with the puts, this cost was calculated conservatively, so, in practice, you probably would have paid slightly less for this hedge. But would you want to? Your potential return, assuming Wall Street's price target is plausible, would be just over 6%, net of hedging cost. And at the same time, you'd be risking a drawdown of up to 15% (the 15% threshold includes the hedging cost)."

With the future of a nation being put in the hands of a new administration, it feels like it is the most important time. When your favored candidate is defeated, it can bring out the five stages of grief - denial, anger, despair, bargaining and acceptance. Anger can be very dangerous as things may be said that cannot be unsaid. This can be even more dangerous when you are the CEO of a public company.In the wake of the US election, clearly emotions were running high for GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) CEO, Matt Maloney. With a surprising victory for Donald Trump not even a day old, Mr. Maloney circulated this email to employees at GrubHub:Source: Foxnews, GrubHub EmailSending this type of correspondence to friends and confidantes is understandable. Threatening your employee's livelihoods for their political beliefs is quite another thing. This must have upset many GrubHub employees; this is evident by the fact this memo was leaked outside the organization. It also is a stark condemnation of many of GrubHub's customers.GrubHub is a web and mobile aggregator for ordering delivery or pickup food. GrubHub takes a fee on each delivery and in some markets also arranges delivery for some restaurants for an additional fee. GrubHub has been able to grow its revenues at a strong rate while enhancing its profitability as well, with its third quarter results summarized well here. The company is not cheap with its price to sales over 6x and its EV/EbITDA well over 20. These metrics are clearly pricing in continued growth which it has been doing quite well.The above email by its CEO, however, may definitely become a headwind for the company. The nature of its business is one without a significant moat; competitors like Open Table offer very similar types of services, with no real change for the end user. Essentially, without customer loyalty, it is easily replaceable; this loyalty is why restaurants likely sign up for its services and will pay premium pricing.Mr. Maloney's email may be a negative game changer for the company. It has brought a lot of unwanted press for the company, which the company is very aware of as it has tried to walk back the tone of this email, as has Mr. MaloneySource: GrubHub, Matt Maloney twitter feedsAlienating half your target market is unwise; the issue with making these statements at a time of high emotion is that they are likely believed by those making them. This cannot go well with those on staff who now likely feel at worst threatened and at best de-motivated; this is evident in the fact this email was leaked out to the media. Neither are positive for GrubHub's business.The TakeawayEmotions are continuing to run high in the after-effects of the election, with the hashtag #notmypresident trending and demonstrations in many cities around the country. However, this type of anger is also creating an equal and opposite anger in some Trump voters who feel they are being painted with an unfair brush. This backlash is the risk to GrubHub's business now.I see this has risk manifesting itself in two ways. First, it could create an immediate sentiment change on the stock. GrubHub's stock is expensive, despite the decent growth performance, based on its price to sales and earnings multiple. Combined with the negative press, this could cause an immediate sell-down.The other way is that investors wait until its year end results come out to see if this actual impacted Q4 sales. Management has forecasted a 10% quarter over quarter increase. Should this fail to materialize, or worse, actually drop, this could be proof of a more structural change to the business. Technically, GrubHub has already broken support with some support at $30:Source: Finviz.comThe risk to a short on GrubHub is that the whole thing is a ""tempest in a teapot"". This is a very real risk as people's memories are short and if GrubHub works better for them, they will continue to use it after the initial anger dissipates.If I go short, it would be via Put options on either a near immediate time frame (November/December expiry) or out to June to capture the year-end financial risk. The short term seems to offer a better risk reward in the event things go negatively as it is more likely to hit short-term, in combination with the general market volatility we are seeing post-election. For example, December $35 Puts are $1.75; should GrubHub hit its resistance at $30, this would provide an almost 3 to 1 return. The long-dated June 37.50 puts currently priced at $5 which gives some value to the time to June for the Q4 results to be reflected but less return on your investment.If you see something in this article that you agree with or, even better, disagree with, please take the time to comment below.

4023651,22148,2016-11-15T14:51:55-05:00,GrubHub CEO has a history of inflammatory statements mostly unnoticed by the media.App downloads suggest that the company isn't seeing any major impact so far.The stock valuation isn't attractive enough to support owning GrubHub with this additional risk.,"By now, most people know that the CEO of GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) made inflammatory statements regarding Trump supporters. Though his clarifications are more reasoned, the damage could already be done.The biggest issue with the stock is that the competitive threats in the food delivery segment are immense. My investment thesis was that GrubHub had successfully transitioned around what seemed like insurmountable competition, but the statements by the CEO could easily erase the first-mover advantage.More Inflammatory StatementsIn a quick recap, CEO Matt Maloney sent employees an email suggesting that Trump supporters resign from the company. Anybody reading the email would probably agree that the email was directed at the small percentage of Trump supporters that are racist and sexist. The problem is that the email sounds like the founding CEO isn't very inclusive of others' opinions.Regardless though, the market has mostly missed that the CEO sent a previous inflammatory tweet. This tweet suggests that Trump supporters aren't intelligent and likely offends most women that voted for Trump, and this was weeks before the election.Anybody can agree or disagree with whether Trump is a suitable President, but roughly half of the population voted for him. The last thing a shareholder wants is the CEO offending half the customer base due to political views. One only needs to read the comment string from this tweet to see how divisive this statement was to potential customers.The scary part for investors is that the CEO doesn't actually tweet that much. In a lot of cases, Mr. Maloney goes months without tweeting, but he took the time to retweet this gem back in March after not personally writing a tweet since February 5.In essence, limited time was spent searching only his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feed to find other bad behavior. One can probably wonder if other inflammatory statements were made on other social networking platforms that the general public didn't previously catch.Competitive ImpactSo many other companies such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) amongst other private firms are aggressively pushing into food delivery. One can only imagine that even some restaurant owners that might skew Republican no longer want to do business with GrubHub and switch business to one of these competitors.The mobile app hasn't seen any huge impact on downloads. The iOS downloads are at the lowest level, but the app is still within normal ranges.Source: AppAnnie.comThe Android stats though show that downloads are actually heading towards the highs.Source: AppAnnie.comEven after the CEO induced selloff, the stock is rather expensive. GrubHub traded on the potential for massive growth in the online food ordering and takeout delivery segment. The large profitability of the company despite the competitive threats made the stock more interesting from the start.Any valuation comparison is difficult because other stocks have different business units. Just looking at GrubHub in comparison to Yelp, the stock is similarly valued based on common P/E or P/S ratios even after the big selloff.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that while one might quickly get past some of the rhetoric in the email from the CEO to employees, the past tweets suggest Mr. Maloney has a history of offending customers. The fact that he only has a couple of thousand followers probably shielded the previous impact from the company.Based on the app download stats, GrubHub will likely survive the inflammatory statements so far. The problem for a shareholder is that the CEO is now only one step away from making another statement that is damaging to the business and definitely the stock. My recommendation is to stay away from the stock due to this extra risk and the stock not offering any value."
4001868,102027,2016-08-24T14:34:43-04:00,Fundamentals Compared.Institutional Support Compared.Technical Trading Compared.,"The restaurant industry has consistently offered tremendous investment opportunities but it is a highly competitive and fickle market. In this article we are going to compare the financial performance of Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP), two social/mobile tech companies servicing the restaurant industry as an alternative way to gain exposure to this explosive industry.Grub has fashioned a business model around online food delivery. The company currently connects consumers with 45,000 restaurants in 1,100 U.S. cities and London, U.K.Yelp's business is focused on connecting people with local businesses through consumer reviews. The company was originally known for restaurant reviews but has expanded into reviews of almost every type of local business and has established communities in 32 countries outside of the U.S.The purpose of this article is not to dissect their respective business (although some anecdotal comments may be offered) there's plenty of opinion and information available on each company for those interested in understanding each business in more detail. Instead, this article is to do a side by side comparison of approximately 40 financial metrics as reported by Marketsmith. The article will also look at the technical trading characteristics and institutional support of each stock.We'll start with the following overview.The companies are nearly the same market capitalization but Grub is currently trading at a premium (based on a higher PE) to Yelp. Grubs superior earning performance and future estimates helps explain the premium the stock is currently receiving. Interestingly, Yelp has delivered approximately 50% more in actual sales over the last 4 quarters. Let's take a look at the actual quarterly sales and growth rate.Both companies are experiencing strong sales growth. The deceleration in Yelp's sales growth (40% four quarters ago to 30% in the recent quarter) is something to keep an eye on especially as the company expands into new service categories. Both companies have experienced some sales growth deceleration. Going back to the September 2014 quarter Yelp reported sales growth of 67%, Grub 75%.Let's now take a closer look at earnings.When it comes to making money Grub has clearly done a better job which is also reflected in the MarketSmith EPS Rating for Grub of 95 versus 39 for Yelp. A rating of 95 suggests Grub has outperformed 95% of all publicly traded companies in earnings. Part of Yelp's underperformance is explained below where R&D expenditures are compared. MarketSmith's EPS Rating is proprietary but combines a company's most recent two quarters of EPS growth with its three-year to five-year annual growth rate. Clearly Grub has done a better job of producing profits up to this point.Below are a few other financial metrics to compare.Notice Grub's pre-tax margin compared to Yelp's . This may help explain why Grub has been able to drop more money to the bottom line. Also interesting is the amount of spending the Yelp is doing in R&D. If this spending pays off for Yelp in the long run it could be a big win. Neither company has an impressive return on equity.Up to this point it appears Yelp has been more ambitious in its business pursuits going after several many review categories where Grub has focused on the food delivery business. Internationally Yelp has also been more aggressive. Both could be reasons for the superior financial performance of Grub up to this point.From a competitive perspective GRUB has aggressive competition coming after their market; it will be interesting to see how well they can defend their business going forward. Yelp appears to be going after already established competition by expanding into markets already served by other competitors.Before we move into a technical look at the trading for these stocks the following information might be helpful.Over the last few years Yelp's mutual fund support hit a low during the quarter ending March 2016 at 236 funds, down from 464 reported at the end of the September 2014 quarter. The big 18.2% jump in fund ownership is the first quarterly rise in 7 quarters. Also, only one of the select funds GDT follows is listed as currently owning shares, down significantly from earlier in 2014 when 10 of these funds reported owning Yelp.Grub institutional support has also waned, peaking during the September 2015 quarter with 415 funds reporting shares. Currently 313 funds report owning Grub and 4 come from the select list GDT tracks, down from 8 in April of 2015.Institutional support data is imperfect and historical in nature but at this stage both of these stocks have plenty of additional room for more institutional buyers to report ownership. For example, LinkedIn (LNKD) reported 962 institutional owners as of the quarter ending June 2016.In terms of short interest, the valuation of Yelp is currently more attractive which may be tempting the shorts to try and bring down Grub. This could also turn into a catalyst for more price appreciation if the broad market continues to rally and Grub participates causing the shorts to cover.Let's take a look at how the two stocks are trading. We begin with a 90-day chart that shows the gap-up post earnings both stocks experienced.Both stocks appear to have handled their gaps up well and were in uptrends leading into earnings.Next we will take a longer term view.Both stocks have spent most of the last two years in nasty corrections. Grub is very close to breaking out above resistance in the low $40's and if it is able to do so could be the start of another bullish leg up. Yelp appears to have more consistent institutional activity but much of that appears to be selling during the decline. Yelp has more overhead to work through and will need to advance approximately 25% to get to the next resistance level which could be a nice swing trade.Next we will look at the price and volume action using the Point & Figure (PNF) method. If you are unfamiliar with this charting technique, there is plenty of information available on the web for those interested in learning more. GDT likes to combine traditional charts with PnF when evaluating a stock's price action.Both of the PnF charts are based on daily prices and show most of the trading in 2016. There are a couple of unique difference that can be spotted between the two PnF charts. First, the recent price consolidation since the gap of for Grub is a sloppy compared to the nice tight action of Yelp. More time has elapsed since the Grub gap so it has had more time to move around but overall Yelp appears to be a better set-up. The other difference is the massive volume Yelp has seen during periods of price advances since May. The column of X's with the red 5 marks the start of May on the Yelp PnF chart.In summary, both stocks offer promise via good fundamentals but a couple of blemishes prevent them from being the very best aggressive growth stock from a fundamental perspective. Both stocks are seeing institutional support but it appears Yelp is attracting more support at present which could help the stock move up to the next price resistance level which would be around a 20%+ gain.From a business model perspective Grub's pure-play focus on food delivery may offer execution advantages versus Yelp's expansion into customer reviews for a variety of consumer services. Grub's number one ranking in the Internet-Content industry group is a vote for that stock.Similar to Priceline's (PCLN) acquisition of OpenTable, both Grub and Yelp may turn out to be attractive acquisition candidates as the social/mobile tech market continues to consolidate.Neither company meets the criteria we require and if the market continues to rally both stocks look poised to participate further to the upside.MarketSmith Data DefinitionsReturn on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity.Debt Level: Calculated by dividing long-term debt by shareholders' equity.Annual Pre-Tax Margin: Calculated by dividing annual operating income by sales.Cash Flow Vs.

4014243,22445,2016-10-24T11:04:35-04:00,"GrubHub has seen fantastic growth and profitability over the years.However, most investors who bought the stock after its IPO have not made much money, if any.And with GrubHub's valuation still rich, I think that at best the stock will not do much and will continue to underperform .","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is one of those companies that are doing great, however just because they are doing great does not mean you should own the stock.At question is not management, the company's products or services or even its growth. For me, besides the above, investors also have to consider the valuation of a stock when weighing risk. And in the case of GRUB, it does not pas my valuation test.GrubHub started as a bubble on day oneGRUB's IPO price back in April of 2014 was $26, and on the first day of trading the stock traded as high as $40.60 a share. Over the next 12 months or so the stock traded as high as $47 a share, only to tumble to as low as $18 a share, losing over 62% of its value. YTD however the stock has rallied once more, and is trading at above its 2014 IPO price, close to $41 a share.click to enlarge)The question is, if GRUB is such a high-flying growth stock, why did it tank a year after its IPO? The answer is that when stock started trading it was already a massive bubble. Let me tell you why.GRUB PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsIrrespective of profitability and revenue growth, I have yet to see any stock being able to support its stock price when trading at 10-15 times revenue. There might be some biotech stocks out there that can do this, however seldom have I seen anything else outside of the biotech sector valued so rich for long. If you ask me, investors who bought GRUB post IPO were destined to lose money no matter what.GRUB Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsGRUB's revenue growth has been impressive, and I think it will continue, however this is already baked into the current stock price and then some. On an EPS basis, yes the company is profitable, however the stock is no bargain.For this year analysts are predicting $0.84 in EPS, and for next year $1.1 in EPS. That gives the stock a P/E of 52 for the end of the current year, and 39 for the end of next year. A forward P/E of 52 is not a bargain folks.The competition is homing in on GRUB's turfGranted that GRUB is the leader in the sector and has seen great growth and the company is profitable, however the competition in the space is after GRUB's turf, and it's out for blood. At some point, chances are that the competition will make a big dent on GRUB's revenue growth and profitability.Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) Ordeup for example is expanding very fast all over the U.S. Granted GRPN delivers to a fraction of the cities GRUB delivers to, however most likely GRPN already delivers in the major upscale markets that GRUB also delivers, to where most of the revenue is.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also another upcoming player in the space. Via its PrimeNow delivery service, AMZN delivers in all locations that Amazon Prime is available.Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is also another major player in the space through its eat24hours.com site. It does not have as many delivery locations as GRUB, however the major markets are covered.UBER via Uber Eats is expanding exponentially worldwide. And then there are dozens of other apps and companies that no one ever heard of, homing in on the sector. Even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is getting in on the act.source FacebookSo while the food deliver sector is still growing healthy, the question if GRUB should be in any portfolio, given how expensive the stock looks to me, and just how about everyone under the sun is also trying to do the same thing.The way I see it, there are no barriers to entry in this sector. Anyone who can make an app and come to an understanding with local food merchants can do what GRUB and everyone else is doing. Eventually something has to give, and that will probably be fierce competition in the sector, at the expense of growth and profitability.GRUB Shares Outstanding data by YChartsI also don't like the fact that total shares outstanding have increased about 10% over the last two years. Yes the company is growing, but at some point dilution will take its toll on the stock if it continues.Bottom lineCurrently GRUB has a forward 12 months P/E of about 52, and is currently trading at almost 9X trailing revenue. This is still a very expensive stock in my book. And that's the reason why very few investors have made any money with this stock, because it was always trading a bubble multiples.While I do not recommend shorting the stock (unless you have a talent for short selling securities), I would also not recommend buying it either, unless we see a generous correction in the stock.If the competition does not get to GRUB, and if the stock does not tumble -- with its valuation being so rich -- at best I expect it to underperform over the next several years, as it has ever since it started trading."
4021845,102040,2016-11-09T22:48:47-05:00,"Improved product will attract and retain high-quality diners to ensure sustained growth.GrubHub occupies a unique place in the competitive landscape, and its scale and first-mover advantage cannot be easily threatened.Through the addition of new offerings and expansion of delivery, GrubHub can still yield exponential growth.","Despite beating both top and bottom lines in Q3, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) suffered a 13% decline in its share price post the earnings announcement. Much of the sudden drop in confidence is as a result of lack of greater acceleration albeit easing comps, including positive weather impacts, more weekend days, an easy 2015 outage comp to be compared against, and an ordering bump from the Olympics. LTM active diners were up 19% in Q3 versus 24% growth in Q2 and Q1, the first time the metric dipped into the teens. Competition concerns were renewed with Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) entrance into online food ordering and UberEATS' (NYSE:UBER) continued ramp-up.I continue to believe the concerns over slowing diner growth and competitions are unfounded. The LTM active diners metric is especially misleading given its lagging nature and the difficult comp that GRUB faced in the second half of 2015, when ad spending surged. GRUB's improving platform will continue to drive comps expansion and deepen its competitive moat. I recommend prudently adding some positions on the recent weakness in stock price.Improved product will attract and retain high-quality diners to ensure sustained growthStarting early Q2 this year, GRUB has added ratings and reviews to restaurants on its platform. On average, 70,000 data points are collected each day, focusing on three key areas: food quality, delivery time and order accuracy. This seemingly small feature has large implications. The new diner sort order highlights restaurants that have better ratings, delivery time and overall customer experience compared to the previous sort order, which was mostly based on the take rate the restaurant was willing to pay. It also creates multiple personalization opportunities, allowing new diners to convert better and boosting repeat sales. 95% of the ordering volume we see at GRUB in the recent two quarters has been from repeat business. Even the NYC market, which was deemed slow-growing and mature, saw its best growth in a year during Q2 with a normalized daily average grub (DAG) growth of 21%. In fact, management stated that the company is now focusing on the quality rather than just quantity when it acquires new customers. This new goal has been successful. Active diners increased 333,000 in Q3 versus 280,000 in Q2, and the overall frequency increased slightly for the first time in years to 12.5 LTM orders per diner. As the company deployed better customer optimization, the overall take rate it can charge is also climbing steadily - from the 15% range in 2015 to 16.5% in Q2 to 16.8% in Q3.The pace at which GRUB is adding rating is quite impressive. JMP Securities conducted an analysis of the 58 overlapping restaurants on GrubHub/Seamless, UberEATS and Amazon Prime Now (NASDAQ:AMZN). The total and average number of ratings roughly quadrupled in four months, while the median number increased more than eight times.I see the pace for gathering user data only ramping up in the future. With more data, more interesting analytics can be generated to optimize user experience. For example, I noticed that on desktops, GRUB sometimes features sponsored restaurants, which are suspected to be a combination of higher-paying restaurants and those tracked by the cookies in the browsers, since this feature is only available on desktop and not mobile. CEO Maloney admitted that it is hard to guide what new features are coming out next, as the company is always experimenting with new things. Overall, I am encouraged by the management's creative thinking and adventurousness, which I believe will be key to drive and sustain growth.GrubHub occupies a unique place in the competitive landscape, and its scale and first-mover advantage cannot be easily threatened.Despite all the competition fears, GRUB seems to be always at the top of consumers' minds. According to a recent research by BAML looking at Google Trends among the food delivery services, this trend is accelerating in both NYC and nationwide in the last 3 months.UberEATS and Amazon Prime NowThe late concerns on the competition front have been on how quickly UberEATS is ramping up. On the surface, there are a few legitimate concerns. First, UberEATS is very focused on promotions, especially for the initial trials, which force GRUB to pursue something similar. Second, Uber has potentially more operational leverage in non-urban cities, where the traffic is not as bad and it can use its network to dispatch delivery fairly efficiently. Third, UberEATS is in nine international markets compared to just one for GRUB.However, digging deeper into the competitive landscapes, I do not believe these concerns are significant threats to GRUB. Based on observations of the 11 largest markets in the US, on average, GRUB has 236 restaurants per city, UberEATS has 152 and Amazon Prime Now has 84. The number of overlapping restaurants on GRUB from UberEATS and Amazon Prime Now is small, at 21% and 15% respectively. Conversely, the two competitors have much larger exposures. 31% and 26% of Amazon Prime Now and UberEATS restaurants are on GRUB. While there is definitely a potential opportunity cost here, since a potential diner ordering from one platform cannot order from another at the same time, it is believed that consumers prefer diversity and ease of use when ordering food. GRUB, with its larger scale and improved product, stands to benefit. Having done a number of channel checks at restaurants in NYC and Boston, I noticed that ordering from GRUB is generally at least 50% more than that from its competitors.In addition, even though UberEATS offers favorable promotions to initial users, its regular delivery pricing is much higher than that of GRUB, making it difficult to compete in the long term. GRUB has been consistently offering the lowest delivery fee at $2.49 compared to $4.39 for UberEATS.FacebookThe social media giant announced a few weeks ago that following its partnership with delivery.com, users can now order food from restaurants' Facebook pages. It is still premature to pinpoint exactly what the impact on GRUB from this change will be. Nonetheless, having tried out the new functionality myself, I see a number of challenges in making this feature scalable. First, the offering of this new feature is only limited to restaurants on delivery.com, which is a much narrower set of offerings than GRUB's list of restaurants. Out of a sample of ten random restaurants I tried to look up, three places don't have a Facebook page, and one place has a page but not an ordering functionality on Facebook. Second, one must physically search a restaurant's page and then try to order from the page. This is much more user-unfriendly than the curated list on GrubHub. Earlier, we mentioned how important customization and customer optimization are for growth. Therefore, the new functionality on Facebook does not appear to pose a significant threat to GRUB.Through the addition of new offerings and expansion of delivery, GRUB can still yield exponential growth.After returning a record quarter in Q2, one question lingers in investors' minds: can the company continue its high-growth trajectory? I believe future growth hinges on two important drivers: new product offerings and delivery expansion. The food delivery services market is still underpenetrated. GRUB, being the largest player of the market, accounts for just 26.5% of restaurants listed on Yelp (NYSE:YELP) in NYC, 23% in Chicago, 7% Atlanta and Seattle, 9% Dallas and 10% San Francisco. Company management realizes the importance of versatility in retaining diners and in blocking competitors. Hence, it has been putting major effort in acquiring high-profile chains and launching potentially high-margined new initiatives. In terms of chain restaurants, there are approximately 175 different chain brands on the platform, most of which were acquired within the last year. In Q3 this year, the company announced that it signed a number of high-profile chains, including Subway, Little Caesar's and STARR Restaurants. Note that the ramp-up time for chain restaurants is typically slow, as most chains prefer to test out a small number of locations before a wider rollout. For example, out of the 175 chains mentioned earlier, only 56 of have more than 10 locations. Nonetheless, because the agreement is already in place, it is easy for fast, broader rollout in the future. Other new initiatives include Thanksgiving meals delivery in NYC, and potential new functionality for SMBs over the next 6-12 months. The latter is an interesting opportunity, especially since GRUB has acquired more small to medium-sized corporate customers in its restaurant delivery service acquisitions (e.g., Delivered Dish).The second driver that will continue to be a major growth opportunity lies in the fast ramped-up delivery network. Despite consistently and rapidly adding new restaurants to the network, 85% of restaurants on the service now offer delivery, up from 55% last year. In Q3, delivery is on pace for a $500 million annualized gross food sales (GFS) run rate, which equates to roughly 17% of total GFS. Delivery also accounts for 25%+ orders in some smaller markets.Clearly, even though delivery is still at a somewhat early stage, its contribution to growth has been incredible. This is only a start. Management expects delivery to break even by the end of FY 2017, and GRUB's profitability will start to converge with the profitability of traditional orders. Therefore, there is significant opportunity for EBITDA expansion. Below are the estimates by Cowen.To conclude, I believe GRUB is a long-term structural winner. It is fundamentally bettering consumer experience, which will translates into sustainable advantage. As the company operates in a big market ripe for change, competitors will always try to take a share of the pie. However, given its large scale and the competitive moat it tries to deepen by improving its products, GRUB's solid position cannot be easily weakened. The future remains bright with opportunities to expand offerings and deliveries."
3994430,102040,2016-08-02T07:31:57-04:00,Focused platform delivers superior execution to drive margin expansion.Success in own delivery network drives revenue growth.Competition has no material threat.,"I first wrote about my bullish stance on GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) last week before the earning release. Given the rockstar earning, I want to provide an updated view. Overall I am still bullish on the company for the following three reasons.1. Focused platform delivers superior execution to drive margin expansionOne of GRUB's biggest differentiators is that the company got into the food delivery industry early and it has been very focused on developing its platform, such as on the front of API and technology integration. This is lacking and cannot be easily built by its competitors. Over time, we have seen such investments paying off. Platform improvements around search, page load times, and onboarding continue to positively impact conversions and order frequency. 30-day orders per ending active diner declined less than 1% year over year, the smallest year over year decline since GRUB went public. The company also made a lot of improvements to the product in Q2, including improved layout of mobile web restaurant landing pages, personal recommendations, simplified search, and funnel improvements. Additionally, GRUB is aggressively adding ratings and reviews, generating 70K consumer data points daily. While none of these improvements is groundbreaking on an incremental basis, a focused platform is able to produce a superior product, allowing GRUB to better understand its customers, direct them to buy more and craft a more seamless shopping experience. Customers certainly appreciate this high quality platform over others. In Q2, EBITDA per order increased to $1.50 to record new height.2. Success in own delivery network drives revenue growthIn Q2, performance from GRUB's own delivery network proved to critics that it is the right investment to boost company's growth. Delivery accounted for ~12% of gross food sales in the quarter compared to ~9% in 1Q. The company will continue ~$4 million investments per quarter. This points to more room for revenue to grow. Currently delivery is only available in 50+ market but the goal is to expand to 70 markets by the end of the year. Furthermroe, GRUB's own delivery network is effectively improving demand. It allowed for addition of restaurants that were not able to participate in GRUB due to lack of delivery offers. These restaurants tend to skew to the mid to upper end. Based on feedback of restaurants that joined the GRUB delivery network, they saw ~10% more orders per restaurants and ~60% more new diners per restaurant than other restaurants on the platform. This amount of high traffic also locks in loyalty on the supplier side. They are willing to pay for the higher commission rate charged by GRUB. Average take rate reaches a new high of 16.5%. There is more room to expand as GRUB squeezes out competition.3. Competition has no material threatThe late earning was able to prove to critics that competition fears from Amazon, UberEats and other private players pose no threat to GRUB. As discussed earlier, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and UberEats are not focused business, so they have less resources to enhance their products for meal delivery. Similar to the private players, those tech giants also compete on pricing. However, sometimes consumers value qualities and their user experiences much more. As indicated in my previous article, GRUB beats other players in both the quantity and quality of reviews on Google Play and iOS app. 90%+ of sales on GRUB is from repeat sales. From surveys, restaurants also said that they are reluctant. Perhaps the more astonishing fact from Q2 is that despite persistent growth in active diners, sales and marketing expenses have been falling as a percent of revenue. New diner acquisition costs has also fallen down to historical average.The Q2 earning shed a lot of light on the latest operational improvements within GRUB. The fact that the company was able to capture such high growth in the short time that these new improvements were rolled out point to the strength of the company. The re-acceleration of the business has only just started. Competitors cannot keep competing on their loss-making platforms and will eventually be squeezed out of the market."
3977076,94406,2016-05-23T11:08:21-04:00,"GRUB has a more mature and profitable company in New York and a higher-growth/lower-profitability business elsewhere.Investors should look at it as two different assets, and the consolidated financials are highly misleading.From this lens, it looks like investors can buy the New York asset at a reasonable price, and get a free/cheap call option on success in other markets.","GrubHub, Inc. (New YorkSE: GRUB) is a tale of two different assets, each with distinctive margin and growth profiles. These assets are its operations in New York (which includes its corporate business) and those in the rest of the country.The New York business is an entrenched category leader with modest growth and high margins, and is subject to low levels of competitive risk. In its operations spanning the rest of the U.S., there is risk of competition from other delivery marketplace (such as Eat24), as well as in last-mile (from competitors such as Uber and Amazon). Limited segment-level disclosures make a granular analysis very difficult.However, I believe that GRUB is utilizing a structure through which it uses its profitable New York operations to fund its aggressive expansion in the rest of the U.S. While the former enjoys significant operating leverage and is likely to be profitable, the latter is currently in high-growth, profitless stage. As such, this article will show how GRUB's consolidated numbers obscure how one should look at the compaNew York. It will argue that based on reasonable estimates, one can create a free or cheaply priced call option on GRUB's non-New York assets.The New York BusinessGrubHub's oldest and largest market New York, within which the Corporate business largely resides is more mature than the rest of the business. For perspective, Seamless, GRUB's New York brand, began operations 16 years ago (before GrubHub's main brand itself). Within the New York business, consumers are said to order considerably more frequently than users in the rest of the country, as New YorkC is arguably the greatest delivery city in the world. As a result, when GRUB reports its consolidated financials, faster user growth outside the New York market pressures the consolidated order volume metric, since non-New York users naturally order take out less frequently.This dynamic became pronounced in Q1 of 2014 (see graph below). Although total order growth is decelerating (which GRUB bears continually point to), looking at one metric alone ignores the reality of GRUB's business as it expands beyond New York.Source: Morgan StanleyA 15 year first mover advantage, sticky user base (90+% of orders are from repeat users), high switching costs for corporate customers, and low competitive risk from last mile delivery services (as the vast majority of mid-range restaurants already deliver) all serve to establish the New YorkC asset as a locally dominant, profitable business. Once diner habits become firmly entrenched, they are very difficult to displace. GrubHub itself merged with Seamless instead of choosing to destroy value and waste resources competing with it in New YorkC (""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em""). Moreover, because of this low-risk competitive position, Seamless has been able to grow and gain operating leverage. My view is that the New YorkC asset is solidly profitable, and GRUB is using it as a source of tax-efficient growth capital (losses in the rest of the country help mitigate the taxes that would have been paid otherwise).Appraising the value of this asset requires some estimation, however. GRUB does not break down financials in such granular detail. Yet, one can estimate these values based on what the compaNew York has disclosed in the past. As per the compaNew York's prospectus, Seamless generated $111M of revenue in 2013 and grew 35% that year. Average take rates were also roughly 14%, as opposed to the 15+% they are currently. Assuming that growth in the 2013-16 period averaged roughly 20%, the New York asset will do roughly $190M in sales this year. Given that pricing alone would have contributed 10%, this assumption requires merely 17% annualized volume growth, which I believe is highly conservative.One should note that Seamless was growing volume at 30+% the years prior. With a sales estimate in place, one can begin to look at the margin profile. Clearly, the New York business enjoys greater operating leverage. Although it will likely not grow at such a rapid pace and is more mature, it is very likely to be profitable, especially if one considers the margins of some of its international comps. This is fairly similar to Netflix, which is actually quite profitable in the US, but is investing heavily in original content and international expansion. If it wanted, it could likely scale down its spending and the earnings multiples would decrease substantially. I think a similar case exists for GRUB, which is (rightly, in my opinion) sacrificing immediate profitability to grow its earnings power throughout the country. It is leveraging its dominant New York platform to execute on this strategy.To begin to determine how profitable this asset might be (again, note that we are not provided segment-level financial details), one can attempt to see how competitors have fared. JustEat, an international competitor, was doing roughly 44% margins in its most mature market (the UK), at lower revenue levels (roughly $114 M).Source: Morgan StanleyDelivery Hero was more efficient, with 57% margins and roughly $50M in revenue. While it surprising to see such efficiency at a lower revenue base, I suspect that JustEat's calculation might exclude stock-based compensation. Even so, it is some indication of how quickly this business model scales upwards.Source: SusquehannaOpenTable, while not a direct comp, serves as an illustrative example. It help facilitate reservations and charges a similar take-rate based model. As such, I believe it provides a good reference for the level of operating leverage one can expect from GRUB. At $164M of revenue, the compaNew York was doing 51% EBITDA margins, with very little maintenance capex required.Source: SusquehannaValuing the New York BusinessGiven this, I believe it would be appropriate to assume that GRUB's New York asset is likely to be generating 45% EBIT margins on at least $190M of revenue. That is to say, if GRUB stopped investing in growth, it could scale back and generate $85.5M in EBIT in its core market of New York. In this market, GRUB has a clear leadership position, generates ample free-cash flow, and would command a high multiple. Assuming a 15X EBIT multiple, the implied valuation for the New York Asset follows:Based on the above assumptions, the New York Asset alone is worth roughly $18.74 per GRUB share. Now, I realize that there are maNew York assumptions involved in reaching this calculation and they are not precise. With that said, allow me to explain the procedure that led to this valuation. I arrived at my conclusions when I was observing GRUB earlier in the year. With the stock in the $18-19 range, one should have looked at what the price implied, specifically for the New York asset (whose prospects are very favorable, in my view). At $18.74, the market implies that Seamless has grown at 20% since 2013, generates 45% EBIT margins, and is worth roughly 15X EBIT.These are all assumptions that I am comfortable with. I am especially comfortable with them because it implies that I am receiving a free call option on GRUB's success outside of NYC. That, in my mind, represents a highly asymmetric investment and a compelling case for going long.My initial article on the company explored my view on the massive opportunity before GRUB, and why it is uniquely positioned for success. If one can receive that optionality for free, then much of the risk posed in buying a high-multiple Internet company goes away.While I do not believe that optionality is free at today's $22-23 price range, it is still reasonably priced. At roughly $330M (the balance of GRUB's present Enterprise Value after adjusting for the value attributable to New York), one is paying roughly 0.2X 2016E non-New York revenues.Given that, I believe there is considerable room for error with GRUB even at today's price, and still more when it trades in the $18-19 range. Given the volatility present in the stock, I would not be surprised to see those levels revisited in the future, and would encourage others to take a closer look then."

Fast forward eight months and the market might underestimate the competitive threats.At the time, GrubHub had come off a period where the stock traded below $20 and the quarterly results weren't showing that competitors were having the feared impact. Now, the stock trades above $40, for a more than 100% gain off the lows, questioning if the market has gotten too laxed with the competitive landscape.Competition Still AroundNo real signs exist that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber (NYSE:UBER), or Yelp (NYSE:YELP) are pulling back in the food delivery sector. Not to mention, the global market is only heating up with Takeaway completing a large IPO in Europe and UberEats expanding all around the globe.The key to the online food ordering and delivery business is local relationships. Once a relationship is established with a restaurant or consumer, the business doesn't alter much.This article (via WhatNowAtlanta) highlights how a relatively unknown on the national scene has a foothold on a sizable food delivery business in Atlanta. Zifty.com is already established with 160 restaurants making it difficult for somebody to transplant the embedded business.This scenario in Atlanta highlights how the first mover advantage positions GrubHub to succeed.Customer LoyaltyThe biggest fear and hesitation with owning GrubHub was the misconception of the market. Consumers might alter the restaurant utilized daily for ordering food, but the restaurant doesn't alter the business partner for online ordering and food delivery.In this regards, GrubHub has shown that consumers consistently reorder from the site. Prime examples are the Chicago and Manhattan markets that have seen customers consistently spend more over a period of seven years now.At the same time, the company has increased spending. The higher levels of spending though have never placed GrubHub into a position where the company wasn't highly profitable.The problem now is that GrubHub trades at nearly 40x forward EPS estimates.The valuation is so stretched now that one has a hard time disagreeing with Cowen that recently raised the price target to only $38. Being bullish on the company is not the same as bullish on the stock.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that competition still lurks. The market continues to wildly misunderstand the situation and misprice GrubHub in the process. The stock is not overvalued, suggesting any potential investor should wait for a dip in the stock."

It is also the owner of Seamless. From late last year to early this year, the stock price has been depressed due to concerns on growth and competition. However, the company has proven quarter after quarter that its future is bright. I believe the three big drivers for share price growth are: 1) market leader position building stickiness into the business and strengthening growth; 2) revenue expansion through the company's own delivery system and M&A; 3) competition fear eases, leading margin expansion.Investment Thesis1) Market Leader Position Building Stickiness into the Business and Strengthening Growth.GrubHub has been a pioneer in the restaurant delivery service, and its market dominance took 12 years to build organically and via M&A. The company's large scale has served as a deep competitive moat. As Figure 4 shows, even though there are seasonal weaknesses in Q2 and Q3, all key earnings drivers are in a strong, upward trend. Most notably, active diners nearly doubled from 4Q13 to 4Q15. Additional stickiness is built through a rapid restaurant penetration rate. Its own delivery system helps expand food options across the spectrum, from fine dining to fast food chains. Such comprehensive platform makes it more difficult for competitors to find niches. The first-mover advantage and continued innovation have proved to be key to sales. Roughly 90% of GRUB's orders are from repeat sales. A diners' survey conducted by RBC in 3Q15 cites that brand recognition is a huge factor in diners' choices. Reviews on Google Play and iTunes indicate GRUB beats out competitors on both quantitative (number of reviews) and qualitative (rating) metrics, with a total of 72,000+ reviews and an average of 4.5 stars. The closest competitor in number of review is Eat24 (NYSE:YELP) with 41,000+ reviews. Most players average 3.5 stars. A similar survey of restaurants finds that restaurants see switching costs (out of GRUB) to be high due to the scale of the platform and the seamless technical integration.2) Revenue Expansion Through Its Own Delivery System and M&AGiven that GRUB has a history of consistent disciplined cost control, revenue expansion becomes crucial to the growth of EBITDA and, ultimately, share price. I believe there is revenue expansion potential in both total orders and take rate (commission GRUB charges per order). Regarding total orders, the company has been expanding the number of restaurant offerings and new markets. Its own delivery program enables addition of restaurants that were not able to participate in GRUB due to lack of delivery offers. These restaurants tend to skew to the mid to upper end or in the chain category. The high-quality nature of this supply is particularly significant from a demand generation standpoint. The company has been actively expanding into new markets. In 2015 alone, it went from being in ~20 markets to almost 60 markets by year end. In December 2015, GrubHub announced the acquisition of Delivered Dish to bolster key markets in the northwest and southwest (added 7 cities).Not only is the total orders increasing, but the take rate that GRUB charges is also climbing. The average take rate climbed 8% from FY14 to 15 as the company scaled up. This trend should continue. In addition, its own delivery system enables faster revenue growth. Figure 5 shows take rate jumps because restaurants are paying a ""premium"" to have GRUB take delivery service off their hands. At a 20% take rate, it is an increase of $1.31 per order. This is likely still cheaper than the cost of hiring delivery personnel. With its own delivery system, GRUB also pockets the delivery fee/tips (assuming 10% $AOV), which brings it to a total $4.15 increase in revenue per order. I don't believe that cost will exceed this gain, especially since there are synergies to a centrally managed delivery system by the ordering platform. As of 4Q15, GRUB's own delivery consists of 8% of total revenue. As the delivery system takes off, revenue will grow at a rapid pace.3) Competition Fears Ease, Leading Margin ExpansionSince 2H15, competitor activities have instilled fear in investors, which resulted in the tumbling of the share price. I believe the competition fear has been exaggerated. Investors should buy in now and take advantage of the positive price momentum as the fear eases. There are three commonly believed categories of competitors: experiments by tech giants, grocery-esque deliverers, and private, direct competitors.The first category, experiments by tech giants, refers to UberEats (NYSE:UBER) and food delivery by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), launched in 2Q and 3Q15 respectively. Those large players' entrances may be concerning, since they have ""nearly limitless capital."" However, one should also be mindful that these giants have own competitor worries for their core businesses. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they go all-in on the food delivery service, where there exists a large, established player such as GRUB. Being only in a few markets (~10 for Uber and 22 for Amazon; all in GRUB's core, saturated markets) and having a small number of restaurant partners, the two players offer very limited choices and differentiation from GRUB. In busy metropolitans, such as NYC especially, UberEats's alleged biggest advantage - fast delivery by cars - may also be its pitfall due to traffic patterns and parking policy. Furthermore, both UberEats and Amazon charge delivery fees on top of the take rate, which make the food more expensive for consumers. Hence, I don't expect Uber or Amazon to have large a impact on GRUB's growth. The second category, grocery-esque deliverers, should really not be factored into valid competition, in my opinion. These players include Blue Apron, Hello Fresh and Instacart, and they deliver groceries. People who order restaurant take-outs are often those who, for whatever reason, can't make their meal. Therefore, they would not be getting uncooked ingredients anyway.The remaining category contains the more comparable, private, direct competitors. Fundraising activities have slowed drastically since 2015. For DoorDash's latest round, the company's initial target was a $1B valuation, but it had to lower valuation due to lack of VC interest. The muted interest in the private companies is most likely attributed to these start-ups' limited success. DoorDash is predominantly California-focused. With GRUB's established national footprint, growth for DoorDash is narrow. Also, the company incurs high costs to acquire its diners. Its spending on Google-generated paid search last year is estimated to double that of GRUB's. DoorDash also has outstanding lawsuits with restaurants for its inappropriate use of restaurant names. Postmates, while boasting a presence in 40 markets, postponed its target profit date to 2017. Moreover, both companies charge a premium for their delivery: $6 per order for DoorDash, and $4 + 9% Service Fee per for order for Postmates). The higher costs are/will be major deterrents to attracting and keeping diners.Separately, we saw in GRUB's recent earnings that competition had very little effect on the company growth. Recall Figure 4 above, which showed that all key earnings drivers are seeing tremendous growth, despite the widely believed heightened competition. As investor confidence returns with the ebbed competition threat, the share price should soar.ConclusionGRUB is in a unique position. As the industry leader, it has crafted a competitive moat to benefit from the first-mover advantage and its brand. Growth has been central to the company's strategy, through both M&A efforts and organic growth. This is especially important in the food delivery market, because scale, selection and efficiency matter. Last but not least, I believe the competitive threats are overblown, and they have not and will continue not to have large impacts on GRUB's profit.General disclaimer: The content contained in this blog solely represents the opinions of the author.

While I recognize that an investment in GrubHub is not swayed too dramatically by the quarter-to-quarter business progress, it is important to stay aware of important trends. By most indications, the quarter was strong, and the thesis appears to be coming to fruition. Recently, however, the discussion surrounding competitive pressures faced by the company are mounting and it appears that the company's positioning in the food delivery chain appears misunderstood. I will also offer my thoughts on that front, and why I believe the company is far better insulated from the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) than one would think from reading some of the headlines.Quarterly HighlightsGRUB grew revenues 23% y/y ex. acquisitions vs. 4Q's +27%. Management highlighted unfavorable (warmer) weather which negatively impacted order growth and revenue by 200 bps. Gross-food-sale increased 20% ex. acquisitions vs. 4Q's 23%. Organic commission rate +19 bps q/q on mix to delivery. For the upcoming quarter, the company is expected to grow revenues 25% at the midpoint of management guidance. The only disappointing element of the quarter was a deceleration in daily active diner growth, although this was to be expected. As the company expands into markets with structurally lower order frequencies (especially compared to New York City), this should be the norm. I do not believe Street models have properly impacted for this, and it is admittedly very difficult to predict precisely. That being said, the stock has fallen meaningfully for what I assume is the miss in daily active diners, which I believe should have been expected. Importantly, GRUB acquired delivery firm LAbite for $65M in cash to enhance the company's delivery network in Los Angeles, Austin & Bay area. LAbite is operating at annual run-rate of $90M gross food-sales, $24M of revenue and $6M in EBITDA for FY16. Currently, its focus appears to be on more upscale restaurants with higher delivery fee, as this is where delivery economics are most sensible. Impact from this acquisition is excluded from Q2 guidance. GRUB's last-mile delivery business has a run-rate of $250M in gross food-sales before contribution from LABite. Despite strong execution and robust investment in growth initiatives, GrubHub is consistently seen as an impending victim of competition from Uber and Amazon, a claim that is important to address.Competitive PressuresOn March 15 th, Uber launched a stand-alone food delivery app, ""UberEats"" in the US in four cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago. It subsequently launched in New York City on March 22nd. This follows the app's initial December 2015 launch in Toronto, and the launch of the UberEats program which occurred in the US in April 2015. The new stand-alone app evolves the UberEats program to represent a more comprehensive marketplace offering versus the program's initial launch. To this end, the UberEats product now appears more directly competitive with GrubHub. Consequently, a number of concerns have arisen regarding GrubHub's ability to effectively compete and gain dominance in its space.Although beginning as a platform for order facilitation, GRUB has made significant inroads into last-mile delivery. This has created some misconceptions regarding GrubHub. Principally, one must answer whether GrubHub is a marketplace for orders (that competes against smaller subscale startups) or a delivery company that competes against the likes of Amazon or Uber. I see it as both a marketplace-model company AND a delivery company, whereas Uber is exclusively a delivery company. Moreover, I view its principal asset to be its order facilitation service, which I feel is relatively well-insulated from competition. The CEO likes to compare Uber to another restaurant on its platform, and rightly so. The vast majority of restaurants on GrubHub/Seamless possess their own delivery capabilities. One does not need to use a third-party delivery firm (such as Uber) to order from GrubHub, and it can actually be quite cost-prohibitive to do so. This is the principal reason why those who believe Uber will substantially disrupt the marketplace aspect of GRUB's business are not entirely correct.Morgan Stanley estimates that roughly 17% of the restaurants on UberEats are unique to the platform. As there is no additional cost for a restaurant to list on multiple platforms, it is likely that neither GrubHub nor Uber will hold unique restaurants for very long. With that said, is there truly a meaningful value proposition for ordering from Uber versus GrubHub? To answer this, consider a standard order and how much it would cost to deliver that (remember the Uber driver needs to be paid as well). On the latest quarterly earnings conference call, GRUB management mentioned that the average take rate for LABites (their recent delivery startup acquisition) is roughly 30%. Since this is the only reference we have, let us assume that Uber charges a similar rate. On a standard $15-25 order, would the average customer really be willing to pay an additional $5-7.5 just for the pleasure of having Uber conduct the delivery? Especially considering that most restaurants on GRUB's platform offer free delivery, this is highly unlikely.Of course, this also assumes that Uber is even really a superior competitor, an assumption which is predicated on the company's ability to magically shorten delivery times. Let us analyze that further. Fifty percent of the time it takes for the average 40 minute take-out delivery in New York is consumed by restaurant and kitchen workflows, which Uber has absolutely no influence over. Given Uber's logistics expertise, it seems reasonable to expect that it could improve upon the last 20 minute segment of last-mile delivery. Even in this segment, Uber's capability is limited. Real world constraints exists: time to drive to the customer, traffic issues, time to secure bicycles, time to enter the building, time for stairs/elevators. Moreover, for the unit economics of last mile food delivery to make sense, couriers need to deliver more than one order per route, which places further constraints on a couriers' ability to deliver in an efficient manner. As such, I question whether Uber can even meaningfully improve the delivery experience, let alone do it well enough to entice a customer to pay for it. GRUB management has commented that unless Uber ""invents a flying bicycle,"" it is highly unlikely to shorten the last-mile delivery process. As far as logistical advantage is concerned, contemporary software, GPS alerts, geofencing, auto dispatch, and proper algorithms will ensure that GrubHub drivers can perform their delivery in a competent fashion. Moreover, because there is no real reason to order from Uber in the first place, it appears highly unlikely that GRUB's marketplace will face major threats and it also seems plausible that last-mile delivery will not be too severely disrupted. For all of the reasons stated in my previous article, the marketplace will be completely dominated by GRUB, and investors are receiving a free call option on whether their last-mile efforts succeed or not.Uber's ability to offer quality delivery is also not an assumption set-in-stone. From the looks of it, the company has seen a strong growth in downloads (see graph below). Given the parent company's reach, it is no surprise that UberEats can be cross-marketed effectively. However, this does not guarantee success, for the aforementioned reasons. App downloads are but one measure of top of funnel traffic. Given the higher prices paid for delivery, a flawless consumer experience is needed to drive conversion and retention, and so far consumer reviews are mixed. Morgan Stanley's survey of app store reviews suggests ~50% of iOS and ~70% of Android user reviews rated the app with a negative review of 1 or 2 stars; this compares with only 13% rating GrubHub this poorly. Reviewers pointed to both technical issues with the app and mixed experiences with the service quality. Thus, it is increasingly difficult to imagine UberEats being the competitive threat many see it to be.Source: Morgan Stanley"
3975844,24849,2016-05-17T18:37:06-04:00,"Amazon continues to add more restaurants to Prime Now.As revenue growth slows, cost controls become more important.At this valuation, the stock seems a bit overvalued.","On Tuesday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced another expansion to the restaurant delivery service included in its Prime Now service. While this news isn't that major for the online retail/service giant, it is extremely important for competitor GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). With Amazon expanding its reach in the segment, shareholders in GrubHub need to be more and more worried.Amazon has really built up its presence in this space during the past nine months, entering the following markets as detailed below from its press release page. Cities in bold/underlined are those that GrubHub detailed as its major markets in its 2015 10-K filing.Amazon had already entered three of GrubHub's seven major markets before Tuesday's news, and Dallas and Manhattan certainly add two more major metro areas to the list. Given how Amazon continues to spend billions a year to make its Prime service attractive to consumers, I expect at least 3-5 more major markets to be entered this year, and perhaps some mid-major ones as well.Amazon's expanding presences makes me a bit worried about GrubHub, especially as non-GAAP EPS are forecast to rise at a rate less than half that of revenues this year. More competition doesn't just take away revenue possibilities for GrubHub, but also will increase the amount of marketing expenses the company needs to battle Amazon.Even with shares down about 6% on Tuesday, GrubHub still trades for about 31 times its non-GAAP projected EPS for this year. That's a somewhat rich valuation in my opinion for a name whose EPS are only forecast to rise by about 13%. With revenue growth expected to slow this year and next, the company will need to be very cost control conscious to get the bottom line moving. That can be very difficult if you are battling Amazon.GrubHub's shares are taking a hit on Tuesday as Amazon has entered two more markets with its Prime Now restaurant delivery service. With Amazon launching in almost a dozen markets since last September, including a number of GrubHub's top cities, shareholders should be a bit worried. As revenue growth slows, can the company get its bottom line growing at a fast clip? That remains to be seen, and at a more than 30 times non-GAAP EPS valuation, it seems like a very risky proposition."

It can be thought of, from a restaurants perspective, instead of having to put an advertisement in the newspaper or online and providing coupons of say ""15% off your next meal,"" the restaurant lists their menu on a 3rd party website that facilitates the ordering and in turn, pays this 3rd party a % of the order, perhaps 15%.While this may prove good for the restaurant in the beginning as it helps drive both new business as well as recurring business, they become stuck paying the 15% to the 3rd party for the facilitation of the recurring orders.Customers then make a habit of ordering the same way over and over through this new convenient online ordering platform.It online ordering platform becomes like a toll bridge where the restaurant is on one side and the customer on the other with the online food ordering platform being the bridge.The War And Why GrubHub Continues To Make The Right MovesThe war that is happening is ""who gets to be the online food ordering platform of choice.""GrubHub reported quarterly year over year growth as follows:Active Diners: +41%Daily Orders: +22%Gross Food Sales: +31%This is clearly the kind of growth that comes from a sector that is growing rapidlyWhen GrubHub first went public back in March of 2014, they were an online food ordering platform only. What I mean by that is they did not provide delivery services like other food online ordering platforms.I have been following GrubHub since they first went public and my initial concerns were they because they did not offer delivery, they opened themselves up the competition from mom and pop local entrepreneurs that would offer both online ordering and delivery services as well.My first article back in May of 2014, I suggested GrubHub could fall to as low as $20 a share on account of potentially fierce competition as well as a concern that insiders would take the opportunity to sell off their shares.I ended this article with this note:I've been very impressed with how GrubHub's management has been continuing to adapt and keep up with the winds of change that are blowing hard and fast in this new industry that is booming.In February of this year, they got into the food delivery business to compliment their online ordering platform.The CEO Matt Maloney noted in the recent quarterly report:GrubHub has to prove to be adaptive to their business landscape. By doing this, they can leverage their business model so to maintain high growth rates and increase their chances of business and investment success.So far so good in my judgment.The Next Battle Ground - Fast Food and Fast CasualIn my area, Ithaca NY, which is a college town, the competition for online food ordering is fierce.If you are a college student at Cornell University or Ithaca College, you an order food online from any of the following platforms now:Ithacatogo.comIthaca To Go is quite a popular online food ordering platform that has a fleet of delivery drivers that handle the delivery when you order food from ithacatogo.com. They have about 40 restaurants to choose from but no fast food or fast casual from what I can tell. They will deliver from restaurants that don't have their own delivery drives and that opens their market.For example, if you want to order food from Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) in Ithaca and have it delivered, you can order through ithacatogo.com and they will order your food and provide the service of delivery too.Grubhub.comGrubHub here in Ithaca does not have their own delivery drivers but is extremely popular. The restaurants use their own delivery drivers. The downside to this is GrubHub would not sign up Buffalo Wild Wings for delivery orders like Ithaca To Go does.eat24.comEat24.com, which is owned by Yelp (NYSE:YELP), has a smaller presence in Ithaca with only 13 restaurants signed up. They to do not have delivery drivers.EZCater.comEZCater.com has 9 restaurants signed up in Ithaca but is specific for large orders for catering purposes. They do not have drivers but act as a platform to which to browse and order food online. The restaurant will handle the delivery.Crunchbutton.comA relatively new food online ordering platform in Ithaca is Crunchbutton.comThis online ordering platform will use their own drivers. What differentiates them from all the others is this:They let you order online for delivery, fast and fast casual food like Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA), Dunkin Donuts (NASDAQ:DNKN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Arby's, Burger King, Taco Bell and a few others.What this means is that the online food ordering and delivery platform has moved into fast food too!GrubHub's Fatburger PartnershipWith GrubHub announcing their new partnership with Fatburger, which has its restaurants on the West Coast in the US, to facilitate both online food ordering and delivery, shows that they too are getting into the fast and fast casual food category. Delivery they say will be at 24 out of their 75 locations but expect that number to grow.If GrubHub is partnering with Fatburger, then that opens the door to many more partnerships to other fast casual restaurants well.In order for GrubHub to continue to prove itself, deals like this have to continue to come about in this rapidly growing industry that is proving to be fiercely competitive.I continue to be bullish on the long term success of GrubHub."
3964501,94406,2016-04-11T16:21:33-04:00,"GRUB looks highly overvalued on TTM metrics, but this is likely not the correct way to evaluate the stock.A better method involves the long-term growth potential and profitability measures the company can realize.Based on what it can achieve within a few years, GrubHub looks quite inexpensive.Investors are also provided substantial margin of safety from the fact that GRUB is already profitable in key markets, which limits downside.","IntroductionMost value investors suffer from 'sticker-shock' when they see a fast-growing internet company like GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). They see the very high multiples and immediately pass over the company. In fact, many notable value investors have come out and claimed that the so-called FANG stocks are overvalued, and that tech is in a major bubble. They are reminded of the excesses of the dot-com bubble and at first glance, many of the similarities are certainly present. The high multiples, low profits, and excessive optimism are there in part. Yet, the analogy is really only applicable in certain cases, and one has to be careful not to generalize. In fact, it is entirely irrelevant in many cases.Some of today's internet companies have proven business models, benefit from strong network effects, and can achieve dramatic scale at no incremental capital investment. Many of these companies appear overvalued based on traditional metrics, because they are spending heavily to expand their competitive moats. So, while the TTM numbers are not inspiring, using them exclusively is NOT the right way to value a company like this.The correct way, in my view, involves a multi-step process. First, one should start by understanding the business model, seeing if there are barriers to entry, and determining if they can be maintained. Then, one has to look further out and determine what the earnings will be several years in the future. GrubHub is a textbook example of this. While it looks expensive now, I believe it has key advantages that will allow it to scale and dramatically increase its profitability several years in the future.Based on that view, I think GrubHub is quite undervalued. GRUB generates revenues by charging a take rate on orders facilitated through its orders. Profitability is currently depressed because the company is spending aggressively on marketing efforts, R&D, and other growth initiatives. Yet, this is actually a very high-margin business once the business scales (and scale does not require heavy capital investment). In this article, I will walk through how to think about the company's competitive advantages, its market opportunity, and what its margins and take rate can potentially be. Once these levels are realized, I believe GRUB will be worth substantially more than its current market price.Discussion of Barriers to EntryAt first glance, barriers to entry appear to be minimal. There are no substantial regulatory restrictions. No substantial capital is required, as the service is delivered through a website and mobile application (which require relatively little capital to build and maintain). A first mover advantage also does not appear to be particularly meaningful. GrubHub's service completely dominates those of some competitors, such as Delivery.com or Foodler, in terms of unique visitors and views per visitor. These were both founded the same year as GrubHub, in 2004. Meanwhile, Eat24, a competitor acquired by Yelp (NYSE:YELP), has gained the second largest market share, despite being founded in 2007.However, there is one key barrier to entry: scale. Scale is the primary obstacle preventing new entrants in this fast growing and highly profitable space. In order for the platform's value proposition to be worthwhile, it needs to be sufficiently large enough to offer users a good selection to order food from. This is only possible through sufficient scale. For the customer, there is a very simple reason to belong to a restaurant aggregation platform, as it can only serve to increase order flow. Moreover, it also allows restaurants free advertising, so the benefits of listing on a platform far outweigh any costs (which are none at the moment; the company transfers restaurant information to its platform on its own).In the future, if online ordering becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the larger companies will be able to demand additional benefits from restaurants, in the form of higher fees or exclusivity (i.e., a restaurant that lists on GrubHub may only list there). Naturally, this is another case in favor of achieving scale. One might make the counter-argument that if GrubHub's commissions become egregiously high, restaurants will switch to alternative platforms or abandon them altogether.This is unlikely, simply because GrubHub and comparable services provide independent restaurants too much exposure. In an NPR report on the matter, a number of small NYC restaurant owners discussed how they were willing to tolerate commission increases because GrubHub gave them business that would otherwise have been unattainable. One café owner talks about receiving orders from the building of prominent Wall Street firms, located in buildings where he would never have been able to slip in a menu and get orders.With regards to scale, the company's service is substantially larger than those of its competitors. With nearly triple the site visitors and views, and nearly nine times the 2014 revenue of its second largest competitor, Eat24, GrubHub is the dominant firm in this space. Since Yelp does not break down revenues by segment, I am presenting 2014 revenue, which was calculated based on Yelp's acquisition price of Eat24.A virtuous cycle exists in this industry: the companies that achieve scale realize the largest revenues, which result in more funds for marketing and website development, which result in greater monetization, which results in larger revenues, and so on. All the while, user habits are becoming 'stickier', and users have no incentive to switch to a competing platform. As such, it becomes difficult for subscale firms to compete with the largest scale one. It also ensures a more stable business model, with revenues being recurring in nature.Additionally, the spending that GrubHub devotes to the marketing side will also not be recurring in nature. Once customers are created and a market matures, the company can lessen its efforts there and focus on other areas. Consequently, this also leads to substantial operating leverage. In many ways, this contributes to a 'winner-take-all' dynamic is somewhat reminiscent of social media and search, which are all dominated by one firm [Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), respectively]. Therefore, barriers to entry are in fact substantial.Last-Mile DeliveryGrubHub is expanding its economic scope to include a delivery service. As part of this offering, the company aims to actually deliver food to diners (so-called ""last-mile delivery""), in addition to serving as the platform for connecting diners and restaurants. This particular space is less concentrated, and GrubHub has no particular dominance here. However, the implementation of a delivery service could help GrubHub penetrate other markets and could actually prove complementary to its existing business. For instance, the company could expand its website to incorporate orders from merchants that typically do not deliver (grocery stores, liquor stores, etc.), and use its last-mile delivery service for the physical delivery.The company's management views this line of business as a necessary complement to help grow the existing service. In last-mile delivery, the company faces intense competition. These competitors, in addition to local firms, include Postmates, Delivery Dudes, DoorDash, OrderUp [acquired by Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)], and Caviar. Postmates's delivery services expand beyond food and total deliveries have surpassed 2 million, and it has signed deals with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).The delivery service industry has notably seen the entrance of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) into the space. Uber launched its UberEats service in 2014, and Amazon launched its own service, Amazon Fresh, in the same year. Currently, Amazon only operates in Seattle, and Uber in several cities - Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, and Barcelona. While the increased competition for GrubHub is alarming, one must take into consideration the fact that delivery is a very local business and there are no obvious economies of scale. So, the entrance of very large competitors is not as negative as it might appear.It is difficult at this stage to determine the competitive landscape of delivery in the future. However, it is clear that GrubHub's core service of facilitating orders (where it is the indisputable leader) will not be severely impacted, especially because it is detached from the actual last-mile delivery. A user on grubhub.com will most likely have his/her order facilitated by the restaurant's own service (restaurants that list on GrubHub already have an in-house delivery service to begin with). As such, the fact that the user will remain on GrubHub's platform is the key issue, not which firm will serve as the agent of delivery.In this context, it would be better to think of UberEats and others as couriers. Moreover, for something like Uber, last-mile delivery is a non-core area. It is difficult to imagine Uber spending considerable resource building an order-facilitation website with as much depth as grubhub.com. The fact that its presence is limited to six cities alone is a testament to this. So, it is reasonably clear that the virtuous cycle GrubHub enjoys in its website business should not be heavily influenced by entrants to last-mile delivery. In fact, the proliferation of these companies might be a net-positive for GRUB.With an increasing number of companies committed to last-mile, the overall TAM for GrubHub could certainly expand. Restaurants that did not previously deliver might begin to use third-party groups (such as Uber) for delivery, while companies such as GrubHub and Eat24 facilitate their orders. That said, however, a prospective GRUB investor should be worried about management destroying value by pursuing last-mile delivery even if competition intensifies. We will have to wait and see how this unfolds.For additional reading on why Uber's dominance of food delivery is not so certain, refer to this article.Market OpportunityGRUB's size in relation to its TAM is very small. According to EuroMonitor International, the independent restaurant takeout/delivery market is roughly $70 billion, with only 5% of orders placed over the Internet in 2014. The other 95% of orders are still placed through traditional channels such as phone or in-person. GrubHub handled $2.4 billion in gross sales in 2015, giving the company a mere 3.4% penetration.This is GrubHub's long-term opportunity. In fact, the combination of economic growth and the proliferation of the aforementioned delivery startups should allow this market to grow at GDP rates at the very minimum. Given the value provided to the diner with respect to reduced friction in ordering, the $70 billion takeout/delivery market should continue to transition online. To evaluate GrubHub's ability to drive further online penetration, one can look at a number of relevant examples.OpenTable serves as a useful comparison. It is a company that allows diners to make reservations electronically and serves as a useful comparison. It is similar to GrubHub in that it is improving restaurant functionality and offering both customers and users a compelling value proposition. Restaurant reservation was once a purely offline activity, as with delivery.However, OpenTable's strong market share growth has shown that the shift to online, as it concerns dining, is a secular one. OpenTable helps seat 39-40% of reservation-taking restaurants in the US (See graph below). Over a longer-term horizon, one might expect an average 40% penetration across the US (with dense urban areas having higher than average, and rural areas below) for GrubHub as well.Source: BarclaysIn San Francisco, OpenTable has even stronger market share, seating 52% of all reservation-taking restaurants (see below). This reflects GrubHub's potential opportunity in urban areas with high population density. The national pizza chains are a helpful precedent case for the online shift of takeout ordering, with roughly 45-50% online penetration for the largest chains like Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) and Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) today.It seems evident that when online functionality is available, customers will generally opt to use it. So, the main challenge for GrubHub is not to create demand for a service, as other companies relying on network effects (particularly the social media companies) have had to do. There is ample evidence that users will naturally shift to online if possible.Source: SusquehannaTake RateIn 2015, GrubHub's realized take rate was approximately 15%. This trend has been steadily upwards, due to a number of initiatives undertaken by the company. In April 2014, GrubHub launched Auction Sort as the default sort algorithm on Seamless, giving restaurants the ability to bid competitively for higher prioritization in the sort order. While Auction Sort has been the default algorithm on the GrubHub site for some time, Seamless historically sorted search results alphabetically. In this alphabetical sort model, pricing was fixed according to transaction volume, where restaurants received a discount depending on the size of their gross sales on GrubHub.The auction-based sort algorithm incentivized restaurants to pay a higher take rate to Seamless. Consequently, GrubHub's take rate increased by 90bps to 14.4% in 4Q14 from 13.5% in 1Q14. Today of course, it is even higher, at 15%. Longer term, it would be sensible to assume GrubHub's take rate will gradually increase as Auction Sort continues to promote competitive bidding in core markets.In the near term, however, take rate could remain flat in the 14-15% range as the company pushes into new markets. As with other companies (such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon), GRUB would be wise to keep rates low until its competitive advantage is well established. For purposes of valuation, I assume a flat 15%, although recognize that it will likely increase over time.Some have expressed concern that these take rates will be unsustainable. However, there is clear value accruing to restaurant owners as well. Orders generated on GrubHub are nearly 100% incremental for independent restaurants, as those takeout diners otherwise most likely would have ordered from other restaurants on GrubHub anyway. By accepting higher take rates, restaurants can drive incremental sales on the platform through higher placement in search results, despite a lower margin.However, such a lower margin can be justified, as users that discover restaurants through the platform can potentially be converted into regular dine-in customers in the future (give the fact that these are most likely incremental customers). As this dynamic will change when GrubHub and its competitors become increasingly ubiquitous, there is certainly a ceiling for how high take rates can potentially go. Yet, I would like to say that the ceiling is most likely not 15% (although for the sake of conservatism, I use only 15%).MarginsAs stated previously, the company appears to be low-margin, but this is obscured due to its heavy spending on growth. To get a better sense of what its profitability can be, one must look to GRUB's international counterparts, Delivery Hero and JustEat, which have already achieved substantial scale. Seen below, JustEat already has 44% EBITDA margins in the UK. In Denmark, these margins are at 44%. Compare that to the consolidated margins of 24% and one realizes that the consolidated numbers do not reveal everything.Looking at the margins in a geography where the company is already dominant will give a better insight into its terminal level of profitability. In the context of fast-growth internet companies, Netflix might represent a good model to consider. Netflix, too is already highly profitable in the US (and with considerable runway to increase prices, might become even more so), and is losing money to pursue growth internationally.Similarly, GRUB is profitable in its core market of NYC, has scope to raise take rates later on, and is investing to grow in other areas. I believe this is a sound long-term strategy. As an aside, it is interesting to note that JustEat is profitable in a non-core market - it began in the UK but is already successful in Denmark.Given that it was able to leverage its scale in the UK to succeed in a different market, I believe GRUB can do the same in the US. Critics of the company have claimed that the space is highly localized, but having a core-market as a cash cow to fund aggressive growth has been a clear recipe for success within tech. A similar case can be made for Delivery Hero, which earns 57% EBITDA margins in its top two markets, the UK and Germany. Note that the fact that Delivery Hero has had success in other markets as well further reinforces the case that GRUB can succeed in the US. While Delivery Hero and JustEat must now compete with one another in Europe, GRUB is virtually unrivaled in the US (on the order facilitation front).Also, I would add that the operating leverage that GrubHub will realize will likely be higher than can be seen here. The fact that Delivery Hero can earn 57% margins this early on in a smaller market means GrubHub should very comfortably drive 50% EBIT margins when it matures. Note that EBIT is very close to EBITDA, as CapEx is minimal (roughly $6 million in 2015).ValuationPutting in all together results in the following table. Looking at the company 10 years out, let's assume that the delivery market expands to $85B given an extremely conservative 2% CAGR. Further, let's assume that 39% of these orders are conducted online, and GRUB maintains its current 51% market share. It is highly likely that the company's scale advantages will result in greater share.Moreover, it might be possible that more than 39% will order online, particularly in urban areas. Finally, with 15% take rates and 50% EBIT margins (again, highly conservative), the company will do roughly $1.27B in EBIT. You are buying the company today for 1.5X EBIT. If this unfolds over 10 years, and the company is valued at 12X EBIT, you make 8X your money for a roughly 23% IRR. To the extent that more of the company's success becomes discounted into the stock, the return potentials are even greater. Consider, for example, how much of the future growth in NFLX/FB/AMZN, etc. has already been discounted into the stock.Of course, this is not to say that risks are not present in this investment. Given that this does rely on future growth assumptions that may not be met, one should be careful. However, I do want to stress that there is considerable margin of safety from the fact that GRUB is already profitable in its core markets. Even if it doesn't achieve these targets, it can easily pull back from its huge growth-related spending initiatives, raise take rates slightly, and become highly profitable.Similar principles apply to a company like Netflix, which can easily stop spending on international growth, raise its prices by a few dollars, which would leave the stock at a reasonable valuation. I might write an article in the future about looking at GRUB on a steady state basis to further elaborate upon this discussion. Until then, I want to end how I started, which is by saying don't be overcome by sticker shock!I am a student of value investing and Ben Graham, but in this case, it would be wise to follow a different approach. The TTM numbers are meaningless here. Consider how ridiculous Google appeared on TTM metrics when it IPO'ed initially. Investors could have bought GOOGL for 1X future P/E when the stock went public, and those who held on certainly made a fantastic investment. I believe a similar opportunity can be found in GRUB for a long-term investor who is willing to hold the stock through volatility over a multi-year time frame."
3969565,101675,2016-04-29T12:16:00-04:00,GrubHub has short interest in excess of 25%.Headwinds contributing to increase in short interest have proved to be less threatening.GrubHub should report strong Q1 results putting further pressure on short sellers.,"GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) has a significant short interest of 23M shares or about 29% of float despite their share price increasing 19% in the past three months. As you can see in the chart provided, GrubHub's share price peaked in late April 2015 and declined almost linearly until January 2016. There were two catalysts for the increased short interest and subsequent decline: the announcement of Uber's (Private:UBER) new initiative UberEATS, and a downgrade by Cowen on competitive fears. In the following article, I analyze where we stand on those issues now and how GrubHub's short interest may affect its share price going forward.GRUB data by YChartsIt was almost one year ago to the day that Uber announced its UberEATS initiative would launch in NYC with the goal of delivering meals to customers in 10 minutes through its extensive delivery network. GrubHub's share price dropped 10% during the subsequent week and short interest doubled to 13% of float between May and July 27th. On July 27th, the ever-bearish-on-Grubhub Cowen downgraded their outlook and price target for GrubHub and from then until mid-January of 2016, short interest doubled again to 23M shares and 26% of float.GRUB data by YChartsThe two aforementioned catalysts had a significant impact on GrubHub's share performance in 2015, but where do we stand now with regard to those catalysts and how do they affect GrubHub going forward?While Uber claims that their UberEATS standalone app has been met with positive sentiment, clearly it has had trouble figuring out the unit economics. The company claims to have hundreds of thousands of users, but despite strong initial growth, just two weeks ago UberEATS shut down its instant-delivery option (i.e. 10- minute delivery time guarantee) in New York City. UberEATS represents an enormous logistical challenge, which includes, according to the Wall Street Journal, requiring drivers to maintain heated containers via the cigarette-lighting outlet and significant wait times for the driver on both sides of the transaction. Investors value Uber at $50B, and they have a large war chest, but they also are spread thin. They are struggling to achieve profitability in China where well-funded, by the likes of Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), local competitors vie for market share, and they have spent many millions of dollars attempting to build a self-driving car because they face what they call an ""existential threat"" from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in that arena. While I admire Uber for the massive logistical network they have built, I do not think that expanding UberEATS can continue to be a focus of the company given that they face serious challenges in their core (read: profitable) business.The report in late July of 2015, released by Cowen mentions further headwinds in the food delivery space for GrubHub. Unbeknownst to Cowen's analysts at the time, food-related (not just delivery) startups would go on to raise $5.7B in 2015 according to CB Insights, and Cowen certainly got the trend right, but how have those competitors sized up? Not so well. 2015 shaped up to be what many in the industry called tech's peak year (in this cycle) with regards to VC investment. So far in 2016, Kitchensurfing (KTCHN) (total raised: $19.5M) and SpoonRocket (SPOON) (total raised: $13.5M) shut down, and DoorDash (DASH) (total raised: $186M) had 16% shaved off their valuation. This is all to say that the food delivery business is difficult, and achieving profitability is a milestone for GrubHub that cannot be overlooked when comparing them to their well-funded private competitors. There is simply no substitute for solid earnings and increasing free cash flow.Meanwhile, GrubHub continues to perform well. In the most recent quarter the company saw >35% YoY quarterly revenue growth along with an increase in diners and daily ""grubs"" in the mid-20 percent range. Furthermore, GrubHub recently announced just two weeks ago that it had expanded delivery into New York City's outer-boroughs, which provided for an outer-borough increase of 32% and 57% in restaurant partners and food sales respectively. I expect Q1 earnings to be strong despite it historically being GrubHub's weakest quarter.Where does this leave us with GrubHub's significant short interest? One of the more interesting metrics to evaluate with regards to short interest is days-to-cover (DTC). This measure indicates to investors how many days it would take short sellers to cover their position with the stock trading at average volumes. In the case of GrubHhub, the DTC currently stands at 13.87. In other words, it would take short sellers about 14 days to cover their short positions. When short sellers seek out new opportunities, they tend to look for stocks with a DTC of seven or below. Anything above seven signals that there is the potential for illiquidity in the event of good news.GRUB data by YChartsWhen short squeezes do happen, they are generally violent. In May of 2013 when Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) DTC stood at 10.86, they announced their first quarterly profit, and the stock price almost tripled in the subsequent 2.5 months due to short sellers rushing for the exits.TSLA data by YChartsGrubHub should continue to report strong results in the coming two quarters due to high organic growth. Furthermore, in recognition of a tightened funding environment, GrubHub's private competitors will strive to achieve profitability, which means they will have to cut back on loss-leading promotions, raise prices and leave unit-economically unprofitable geographic regions. I expect GrubHub to reach the $30-plus range on fundamentals alone with a short squeeze only exacerbating those gains and pushing them higher.From the short interest chart I provided earlier in the article, it is clear that more than 66% of GrubHub's short interest was sold short at or below $30/share. Short interest reached its 23.72M share peak in mid-January when GrubHub was trading at $18.85/share. By mid-February short interest had decreased by 11%, precipitating a share price increase of 9%, what one might call a mini short squeeze, which gives the reader an idea of what to expect. If GrubHub does manage to reach the $30-plus range on the back of fundamentals, short sellers positions will become unprofitable, which will cause a cascade of buying-to-cover, and likely see GrubHub's share price rise into the mid-to-high $30s.I do not invest in companies to take advantage of short squeezes. I subscribe to the theory that investors who take on significantly more risk by short selling are generally better informed than John Q. Public. But I think that they got this one wrong. I'm invested in GrubHub on a multi-year time scale. They have more than 6M users (myself included), and have barely scratched the surface of the massive online food ordering market. Even if private competitors do end up becoming successful, I still see GrubHub having the ability to triple their market cap in the coming few years. But, just because I'm invested on a longer horizon, does not mean that I will not recognize and be appreciative of inefficiencies that result in large short-term gains."

No other online delivery company has near the market share of GrubHub after their merger with Seamless. Additionally, active diner growth, gross food sales, and daily orders placed continue to grow. The company is projected to grow revenue over 40% this year, and 30% the following year, according to analysts, and thus is a high growth stock. We are bullish on this stock, given the increasing trend to order food online and the desire of restaurants to have a more technology advanced solution to acquire customers and manage orders. Additionally, the valuation of GrubHub looks attractive given the companies high growth versus its peer set and competition does not appear to be a major concern for GrubHub.In the third quarter, Active Diners were 6.4 million and the site averaged 211,000 orders per day. Revenue increased 38% year over year with the company expecting higher revenue capture rates through its own delivery efforts. In terms of competition (see Google search below), the only companies with any major scale appears to be delivery.com and Eat24, but they are many multiples smaller than GrubHub. Neither of these businesses are as well capitalized as GrubHub (both are private) and are not able to spend as much on customer acquisition and technology investments. Ultimately this business has some network effects to it and most people will not feel the need to use multiple online delivery systems once they have one they are comfortable using, with the majority of people using Seamless or GrubHub. Source: Google Search For Online Food DeliveryGrubHub is also expanding to chains, with a huge amount of the target market associated with their business. Many chains are currently in pilot mode with GrubHub and the company is formulating systems that make sense for GrubHub, the chains, and diners. This presents enormous upside for investors with many existing chains such as Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) and newer cooler chains such as recently public Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) likely to consider technology partnerships if they are financially sensible.We see the negative third quarter items as short-term issues. The company had lower sales as a result of the consistently dry and mild weather, which was something relatively unpredictable and through the law of large numbers is likely to occur at some point. Additionally, there were technology issues which caused people to have trouble connecting to the website, these were partially attributable to merging technology between Seamless and GrubHub and we do not expect major issues going forward.In terms of valuation, we looked at other high growth internet companies to see if GrubHub was undervalued. For comparable companies(see below), we selected high growth consumer internet businesses with market capitalizations similar to that of GrubHub. GrubHub trades in line with its peer set in terms of enterprise value to revenue multiples, however it trades at a large discount to its peers in terms of EBITDA and earnings multiples, as a few of its peers are not even consistently profitable. Thus in terms of valuation we see this as a better time to purchase the stock, as all the previous concerns of the stock have already been priced into the stock via its recent plummet.Source: Author AnalysisOverall, GrubHub looks like a good addition to a diversified technology portfolio. Many high flying Internet stocks can be very volatile but there is definitely an argument that scale matters in the online delivery market and GrubHub is the clear leader following its merger with Seamless. At a more reasonable valuation, now may be a good time to purchase the stock, as it heads back to a price in the mid 30's in line with analyst's revised projections."

Revenues jumped 38% year-on-year from $61.9M to $85.7M. While margins did not improve as much as revenues grew, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA still grew a respectable 5% from $20.4M to $21.5M. Net income increased by 6% from $6.5M to $6.9M, and non-GAAP net income went from $10.1M to $11.5M.With regards to the company's key business metrics, active diners exploded by 41% year-on-year from 4.57M active diners. Daily average grubs also grew by a large amount-22% year-on-year from 172,700 daily average grubs. Finally, gross food sales jumped by 31% from $424M year-on-year.The company continues to post excellent results, and based on the company's stock chart, the results seemed to have stirred up investors. Source: Stockchart.comSince about six months ago, the stock has been on a steady downward trend. From April, when the stock was in the middle of a plateau, the stock dropped from about $47 all the way down to a low of $24 in late-September, representing a return on investment of almost -50%. Ouch. Also, it does not help that the 50-day moving average has crossed over the 200-day moving average, which could signal more downside ahead.However, since late-September, the stock has begun a resurgence in appreciation, with a return since then of about 40%. Upon this upside, the stock almost immediately dropped back down again. Obviously, what we have here is an extremely volatile stock, which is characteristic of any high-growth tech start-up.And with these sorts of start-ups, investors should know that margins typically do not begin to improve by a substantial amount until the company exits the early, rapid growth phase of its lifecycle. Much of the company's cash is spent on rapidly expanding top-line growth with little to no regard for the bottom-line. As such, when a company reports such results as mentioned above, there really should be no cause for concern. Investors should be expecting results like these from the company. If there is any margin improvement, it should be considered icing on the cake, but investors should not expect any consistency in said hypothetical margin improvement. The only case for which investors should be concerned is if top-line growth begins slowing down. Without sustained top-line growth, the company will end up quickly exhausting its resources since it does not have a cash cow business on which it can depend on.As mentioned previously in the article I wrote about GrubHub, I mentioned that GrubHub was a disruptor in the food industry. Essentially, GrubHub merged technology with the food industry. Although this is nothing new, GrubHub has managed to take this new fusion and grow to this size, which is a substantial accomplishment. Furthermore, with its acquisition of Seamless, it knocked out a large potential competitor and bolstered its market share.Sure, GrubHub may be a risky investment, but with GrubHub in particular, the risk-return profile is skewed toward the upside, albeit by a small amount (probability-wise). Investors should certainly not risk a large amount of capital in this investment, but if investors are looking for a fast-growing tech investment with a chance for substantial capital appreciation, then they have just found it. Furthermore, with the recent dip, investors can buy in at a great discount."
3632276,77875,2015-12-03T08:27:36-05:00,"GrubHub faces increasing competition, which threatens growth and profitability.4 factors drive revenue growth, but 2 of them are set to decline.GrubHub's take rate is not sustainable and I expect a deterioration of 40-70bps in Q4.Shady insider selling provides little confidence.","Earlier this year, I published an article in which I explained why GrubHub's (NYSE:GRUB) growth opportunities are limited. Q3 results have now highlighted that the high-growth period is finally coming to an end. Additionally, they have raised further concerns around competition and margin pressure. In the following, I will dive deeper into GrubHub's fundamental growth and profitability drivers and lay out why I believe a 24% sell-off is not enough.GRUB data by YChartsIncreasing CompetitionGrubHub faces increasing competition from several entrants in the food delivery market. This stretches from well-established companies, which want to expand into the fast-growing food delivery business, such as Uber Eats (NYSE:UBER), Yelp Eat 24 (NYSE:YELP), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) to go and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), to smaller companies and start-ups such as Blue Apron, Munchery, Freshly or Favor that position themselves as niche players. Perhaps, the biggest surprise was the entry of Amazon. In September, the company announced to start a food delivery service in Seattle, which a month later expanded to Portland. Even though Seattle and Portland are not among GrubHub's most important markets, I believe Amazon will eventually be the company's biggest competitor. Amazon has the funds to invest heavily and expand quickly. Reports suggest that the company has been hiring people for a restaurant division in New York, too, so a move into this market seems just a matter of time. Such a move would be a clear negative for GrubHub because, according to management commentary, New York is one of its most important markets.On the other side of the spectrum, several smaller companies and start-ups are entering the market. Collectively, these companies have raised more than $650m in funds so far. They often position themselves as niche players, entering parts of the food delivery market that are under-penetrated. Blue Apron, Plated or Hello Fresh deliver pre-packaged ingredients and recipes, leaving the cooking to the customer. Munchery and Freshly deliver microwavable meals that are delivered cold, as opposed to ready-to-eat take-out meals. Favor instead offers a food and all-purpose delivery service that allows users to order anything they want from local restaurants and shops. Others like Sprig offer a limited but varying selection of meals to be delivered which are prepared by Sprig itself and not by a restaurant. Even though none of these directly competes with GrubHub in the online take-out market, they still target the same customers. Given a wider variety of services to choose from, customers will switch between services more often depending on occasions and day-to-day preferences. There surely will be a stable customer base for each of these services but competition for the additional marginal customer is definitely increasing. This threatens GrubHub's growth ambitions as other services capture their share of the food delivery market. Furthermore, increased competition will lead to higher customer acquisition as well as retention costs, posing a threat on margins.So, GrubHub's business model is challenged both vertically from competitors in the same field as well as horizontally by niche players whose business model is different but who target the same customers.(click to enlarge)(Source: own research)Deciphering GrubHub's Growth DriversWe can separate GrubHub's revenue growth in 4 components:These measures allow us to evaluate how well GrubHub is doing in growing its business and where the growth comes from. The 4 components are affected by different factors and have the ability to offset each other. So, deciphering GrubHub's growth into these 4 factors provides a better understanding than the headline revenue number.click to enlarge)In Q3 2015, GrubHub was successful in adding new restaurants to its network, growing the number of active diners by 40% yoy. The average ticket (+6.7%) and take rate (+5.9%) also increased by mid-single digit percentage points compared to a year ago. However, grubs per diner in the quarter fell -13% yoy.click to enlarge)Where Is The Growth?GrubHub's revenues grew by just 38% yoy in the last quarter, which was significantly lower than the 47% - 51% growth range it had consistently been in in prior quarters. Management claims that adverse weather effects had a negative effect on average daily grubs to the extent of 1.5%. But even when factoring this in, revenue growth would still have been only 40% yoy; far lower than its historical growth rates.(Source: company reports)So, the question now is if GrubHub's growth can re-accelerate or if it will decelerate further. A look at the components driving growth paints a mixed picture:CEO Matt Maloney spoke about the addition of chains on the Q3 earnings call:(Source: company reports)(Source: company reports, own calculations)To sum up: out of the 4 factors that can drive growth for GrubHub, I believe only two have the potential to actually do so.Making The Numbers WorkGiven the above mentioned I believe GrubHub's growth will further decelerate and indeed management guidance of fourth quarter revenues between $98m and $100m already implies yoy revenue growth in the range of 33.7%-36.4%. It is important to note that GrubHub's management blamed adverse weather effects and website outages for the disappointing Q3 results. As CEO Matt Maloney noted on the earnings call:This was further emphasized by CFO Adam DeWitt:Yet, guidance implies an even accelerating slowdown in revenue growth. I doubt that management is forecasting further weather or IT-related impacts, which is why I suspect GrubHub is facing some more serious fundamental problems. We can use our framework of growth components to evaluate what management guidance implies for the different factors.Q4 and Q1 are the two strongest quarters for GrubHub. People spend more time inside because of the weather and thus order more food for delivery. This is evidenced by the number of daily average grubs and gross food sales which both historically showed strong qoq growth rates between 15% and 20% in Q4 and Q1. In the spring/summer, these metrics used to be flat to slightly down.click to enlarge)(Source: company reports)This has historically translated into an increase in the value of the average ticket and in grubs per diner qoq. While the value of the average ticket has been growing consistently every quarter over the last 2 years, the change was more pronounced for the Q4/Q1 quarters, while for Q2/Q3, the change used to be only marginal mostly. On the other side, grubs per diner have been on a downtrend in general on a yoy basis. Yet, when looking at qoq numbers the effect of the strong winter quarters is material. In the summer, grubs per diner have historically declined by between -5.5% and -10.5% qoq whereas the winter evidenced increases between +1.5% and +6.7%.click to enlarge)(Source: company reports, own calculations)Knowing this, we can forecast both GrubHub's average ticket size and grubs per diner in Q4. Remember that the average ticket is calculated as (gross food sales / total number of grubs). Daily average grubs and gross food sales historically showed little fluctuation in their respective qoq growth rate in the fourth quarter. For daily average grubs, qoq growth rates were 17.8% in Q4 2013 and 17.4% in Q4 2014 while the latter increased by 19.7% and 19.9% respectively. We can thus estimate an average ticket value of $28.98 in Q4 2015 based on the average growth rates of 17.6% qoq for daily average grubs and 19.8% qoq for gross food sales. This compares to $28.45 in Q3 and $27.24 in Q4 2014, representing yoy growth of 6.4%, which would be slightly lower than the 6.7% and 6.5% seen in the two previous quarters.For grubs per diner this is a little more difficult because it is connected to growth in active diners. However, given that Q4 is usually a strong quarter for GrubHub with a strong increase in total grubs it is safe to assume that the metric should grow compared to Q3. We also know that yoy growth of active diners has been falling and that chains will not be added before 2016. So I would predict no material pick-up of growth here. I believe a growth rate of around 40% yoy similar to the one from last quarter would be reasonable. Such a growth rate would imply 3.25 grubs per diner, a 7.4% increase over the third quarter. This would, however, still represent a decline of -12.4% compared to a year before.The beauty of our model is that because of the obvious interconnectedness of grubs per diner and the number of active diners, all we need to know is the number of total grubs. Once this is known, the actual level of growth of the two metrics does not matter anymore because slower growth of one of the two factors is implicitly compensated by higher growth of the other. So while the real numbers would have some useful explanatory power, for modelling purposes they are more or less irrelevant. Now, let us have a look at management guidance again: the guided revenue range indicates revenue growth of 33.7%-36.4% yoy. Using our model we already know 3 of the 4 inputs we need to explain growth. The only one that is left is the take rate. In order to make management guidance work, the take rate would have to be in the range of 14.8%-15.1%. This would mark a material deterioration compared to last quarter's 15.5%.(Source: company reports, own calculations)The only way to model a stable take rate would involve a slower growth of the average ticket, which would in turn mean lower than anticipated grubs and/or gross food sales. However, given the fact that Q4 usually is a strong quarter in which people naturally order more food because of the weather, I believe management is implicitly telling us that they expect a deterioration of the take rate. This comes despite the fact that the company is rolling out its own delivery service on which they claim to capture a higher take rate. I suspect that GrubHub is seeing strong competition and that as a result they are forced to lower the commission fees paid by restaurants. This would be a big blow to the stock in my opinion as it would put more question marks on GrubHub's achievable profit margin.After The Sell-Off: Still More DownsideEven after the sell-off, GrubHub is still trading just where it was about a month ago. Forward P/E and P/Sales ratios are still stretched. GrubHub's growth momentum is clearly fading which is why investors are focusing more on profitability and earnings potential. This was evidenced by the sharp move down on earnings day when EBITDA for the last quarter came in 14% below consensus. Revenue actually only missed expectations by 1%. The reason for this was a 47% increase in costs driven by higher operations & support costs, which almost doubled compared to the year before (+86%). This can to a large extent be attributed to increased investments in GrubHub's own delivery service so that might fade away over the course of next year.GRUB PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsA deteriorating take rate would be a more significant negative for the stock, as it would add to fundamental concerns about competition and margin pressure. These concerns are wide-spread across investors and substantially threaten GrubHub's equity story. Any evidence of this would lead to more selling in my view. Furthermore, lingering concerns represent a risk overhang that will prevent investors from ""buying the dips"", making a post-sell-off recovery unlikely. As noted above, I do not believe GrubHub's take rate is sustainable and expect a deterioration to drag the stock significantly lower.Alarmingly, it seems that management agrees with this. Both the CEO and CFO recently sold shares worth a total of $2.2m at prices above $30 per share. More notably, these sales occurred between 8th and 15th October, so just weeks before the disastrous earnings announcement. Back in June, there had already been another instance of insider selling which then led the stock -4.2% lower. What is striking here for me is the timing of the most recent sales. Shares had just recovered from a low of $24 and the earnings announcement was just around the corner. I presume management at that point already knew that numbers would disappoint somehow, so these transactions definitely look shady to me. Additionally, even at all-time lows of $24 did management not buy the shares of their own company but instead waited for a share price recovery to sell again. If the CEO does not consider GrubHub worth buying at $24 why should we?"

Despite claims otherwise, the online food ordering and delivery service faces fears of mounting competitive threats.At $21, GrubHub is valued at $1.8 billion. While the service is highly profitable, the profit picture isn't improving much with growth due to investing in food delivery and pressure on commissions. Is the stock worth a gamble at the lows?My original hesitations with the impressive GrubHub story was that the leading brand in online food ordering didn't have the scale to hold back a whole host of entrants into the general sector. From Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Uber (Private:UBER) to Yelp (NYSE:YELP) to numerous startups, the competition dove into the sector that promised big profits from developing a network and the related benefits.The quarterly results and management commentary tend to tell a different story. GrubHub continues to add restaurants, diners and orders to the business at a fast clip. The below results for 2015 show no appreciable difference in the growth from what the company did in 2014.Source: GrubHub Q4 2015 presentationWhen asked directly about competition on the earnings call, CEO Matt Maloney had the following to say:Analysts such as Oppenheimer turned neutral on the stock due to the perceived threats from Amazon.com and Uber that have bigger networks, but unrelated to food ordering and delivery. The real question though is whether these services can beat a focused brand like GrubHub. Do restaurants really want to deal with Uber when food delivery is a secondary business?Without the fears of competition, the stock would be attractive at roughly 23x forward earnings. GrubHub is reasonably priced at roughly 4x 2016 revenue estimates.Though the company might rightfully see the stock as cheaply valued, the recommendation is that GrubHub saves the $100 million proposed for stock buybacks. At this point, consolidating competition and building a bigger network would provide a huge benefit to the long-term prospects of the company and hence the stock.The key takeaway is that the stock is near a point where it becomes attractive. Most of the analysts appear afraid to recommend GrubHub despite the evidence that competitive threats are waning, if anything. The downturn in venture capital funds should help established brands and networks shake-off startups that no longer are getting adequate funding.For now, I'm taking a watch and see opinion on the stock. Any more signs that competitors are leaving the space, GrubHub is a buy."
3650136,80285,2015-12-05T09:50:36-05:00,"GrubHub has a strong value proposition for both diners and restaurants.The market is confused about the company's business model and has misinterpreted Q3 results, resulting in a massive drop in share price.Its growth is intact and the move into food delivery should accelerate growth.GRUB has several durable competitive advantages over newer competitors, which gives it significant staying power.The company has the potential to compound multifold if the network achieves greater scale as expected.","A wise friend once told me that if I wanted to start a business, I should focus on the ""seven deadly sins."" Collectively, they've spawned some of the world's oldest and most lucrative professions (prostitution for lust, enterprise for greed, luxury goods for pride/envy, etc.). GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) targets our inner sloth and glutton. The company offers us a variety of delicious local food whenever and wherever we desire, saving consumers precious time at little additional cost.Essentially, GRUB is the Priceline (PCLN) of restaurants; its app and website allow customers to submit advance takeout or delivery orders for independent restaurants/cafes. Those living in NYC should be familiar with its subsidiary service, Seamless. Since the late 2000s, GRUB has expanded rapidly to every corner of the US, making its mark as the dominant player in the US takeout and food delivery market.Core ThesisUnlike most new startups that burn through cash with no profits to show, GRUB already has a profitable, free cash flow positive business that continues to grow at breakneck pace. Our analysis also shows the company possesses key competitive advantages over smaller rivals. The thesis is simple: GRUB's share price has tanked over the past few months due to a myriad of non-durable issues, such as the market's confusion over its business model, fears of intensifying competition, understated net income due to higher spending on expansion efforts, operational hiccups that have led to a slight revenue miss and some insider selling.GRUB's value lies in its platform, which is significantly undervalued at these levels given its scale, widespread usage, cash generation and growth rate. We believe the company's business model has durable staying power and has the strong fundamentals needed to thrive in the long run. In essence, it's the best value bet for the restaurant order and delivery space.Value PropositionGRUB's value proposition is simple. It enables customers to order takeout and delivery with ease, saving them precious waiting time and a potentially very long queue, thus making the process more efficient - far easier than calling and yelling their orders to staff in a crowded, noisy kitchen, or having the line blocked on a busy Saturday night.Crucially, it allows customers to order takeout and delivery at smaller, independent eateries that would otherwise not be able to afford to set up a standalone platform for taking and processing orders. This enables cost savings and greater efficiency, thus allowing the restaurants/cafes to function more effectively. Also, by aggregating of a large number of restaurant listings, smaller and less-well-known local restaurants stand to gain publicity by listing their presence as users search for eateries based on proximity or the type of dish they desire. The app also allows users to discover new food options nearby and rate their experiences at different restaurants.In return for making the process easier and more quicker for both customers and food joints, GRUB takes a percentage-based commission (roughly 14%) out of every order. Depending on the payment option (flat fee or percentage) and payment tier that restaurants opt for, they will be ranked higher or lower on the search priority in the app/website. The strength of the value proposition to the perspective of restaurant owners/operators is that the GRUB platform generates more sales at no additional or fixed expense to the owners as they only pay for actual orders made on the platform on a commission basis. Hence, there is no financial commitment or risk of loss for the restaurateurs, customers are able to get access to quick takeout and delivery, and GRUB makes a ~14% commission from this much-desired service, which is far lower than the 20-30% commission rate charged by traditional food delivery services. A win-win-win situation.Unlike many Internet start-ups with a weak value proposition, or try to manufacture a need where there isn't one, GRUB's platform solves a real existing problem and has great potential for expansion. Currently, it operates primarily in the US and London, and has yet to expand into other markets. Given the highly fragmented nature of the industry, we believe GRUB's current scale and first-mover advantage gives it an edge over newer and smaller competitors.The Market's ConfusionThe market has lumped GRUB in the same category as food delivery services, and was priced as such until quite recently when it suffered a tremendous drop after Q3 results. The market does not quite understand GRUB's business model. At its core, GrubHub simply offers a platform that aggregates orders and passes them through to independent local restaurants, kind of like what Booking.com does for hotels/BnBs. Although GRUB does offer delivery services in a few select markets, it is not a food delivery business.GRUB's key offering is its platform. By signing up more independent local restaurants and eateries, it achieves scale and is able to capitalize on the network effect as restaurants and eateries want to be listed on the platform because to gain incremental sales and enjoy ""free"" marketing on the platform. Think of how Booking.com consolidated listings of smaller, independent hotels all around the world, or how Airbnb (AIRB) aggregated listings of independent homestay rentals that one would otherwise not have access to.The economics of building such a platform means the initial growth process will be slower and more expensive as intensive sales and marketing will be required to convince the first few thousand or hundred thousand restaurants to sign up to the platform, before word-of-mouth and the network effect take over. If we were to plot a growth curve, the expansion stage would be exponential before tapering off due to saturation after achieving mass scale. If one truly grasps this growth model, the drastic drop in GRUB's share price does not make sense.Following GRUB's Q3 results, the share price plummeted ~33% due to growth, competition and margin concerns. However, a more accurate understanding of GRUB's business model reveals that there is still plenty of potential for expansion, and shows that growth is well and alive.Growth TrajectoryNote: 2015 full-year figures were projected using results up till Q3 and taking management's guidance for Q4. Q4 net income was projected based on margins remaining fairly stable in relation to the first three quarters.Even though GRUB is still in its initial rapid-growth phrase, the company is already profitable on both a cash flow and net income basis. This is a testament to the attractive economics of its business as each new order provides incremental free cash flow given that the platform is already in place, and that most fixed startup costs have already been expensed.Much of the rapid capitulation in share price after Q3 results was due to growth concerns. However, when we examine the actual figures and historical trend, GRUB is still growing very strongly in terms of revenue, profits and active users.Seen above, the number of active diners and the gross food sales processed through the company's platform have exploded in the past few years, indicating GRUB is well on its way to achieving sustainable scale. (Gross food sales processed may be a better indicator of active diners as GRUB defines active users as those who've made an order in the past 12 months). Furthermore, the growing popularity of fast and convenient dining options, takeout and food delivery allows GRUB to gain and monetize new users more effectively.Large Drop After Q3 Results Is UnwarrantedZooming in more on Q3 figures, revenue growth was actually fairly strong at 38.4% YoY, which missed expectations slightly by $0.84M. Similarly, growth in active diners rose by nearly 41%, indicating the strong growth trajectory was likely to continue. The greater concern cited by analysts was regarding the rapidly rising costs, as total expenses rose nearly 47%.When we break down the expenses and put them in context, we realize the bulk of the increase in costs came from sales and marketing, which increased ~50% YoY. Although operation costs increased nearly ~45%, this is in line with the prior trend. If we took marketing and advertising expense at the same levels compared to Q3 2014, total costs would have only increased by 34%, which is far less alarming than the headline figure of 50%.Higher spending on marketing to grow the business and to reach more consumers is necessary for a company in the rapid growth phase. Investors should not be alarmed as this is part of management's strategy to scale faster given that other players are getting into the space.While bears would argue that GRUB's marketing expense is not really crucial given that the share price is closely tied to growth expectations (which correlate with marketing spend), this concern is alleviated when we consider things from a ""steady-state"" perspective. Ultimately, GRUB will exit the growth phase when it has achieved sufficient scale. Under future ""steady-state"" conditions, marketing spend will be much lower as a percentage of revenues, which allows for higher margins.Furthermore, because of the economics of an aggregating network like GRUB's, growth comes much cheaper the bigger the network's scale is, because the value proposition for both diners and restaurants grow stronger. With more diners and restaurants on the platform, GRUB will be able to generate more publicity and demand for its restaurant partners whilst offering consumers a wider range of choices. This creates an obvious incentive for restaurants to list on the platform, and for diners to use the app. Hence, much less marketing is required.Moreover, we should keep in mind that monetization of new customers takes some time after the point of acquisition. The results this quarter simply reflect the reality of spending now to generate more cash in the long run. Diners who order from GRUB's platform are more likely to be repeat customers than those who make one-off orders. With the growth in active diners and daily average orders this quarter, the effort has clearly paid off. In the context of increasing competition within the space, putting in more cash to scale the platform is a sound strategy.From a long-term perspective, GRUB's results and actions were quite encouraging. Given that the company has nearly ~$150M in net cash and short-term investments (after deducting deferred taxes and long-term liabilities), it is appropriate that it should start spending to scale the platform as quickly as possible, thus preserving its advantage over smaller and newer competitors.GRUB's results were also impacted by many one-off factors, including ""consistently bad weather"" and two major platform outages. In particular, GRUB took a big hit after two outages on July 3 and Aug. 29, losing revenue and damaging its reputation. Obviously, this was a disaster both PR-wise and for the bottom line, which was probably why the company narrowly missed revenue expectations this quarter.In the long run, we believe lessons will be learnt and mistakes like the outages will be minimized. There was no lasting damage to GRUB's brand or prospects. After all, management understands that the business can only expand with a reputation for reliability and consistency. This is the sole reason why it is moving into GrubHub Delivery, which we will discuss shortly. These factors and a ""greater than anticipated"" investment in GrubHub Delivery ate into margins and revenue growth, resulting in poorer optics this quarter. Despite this, we believe the company's fundamentals remain solid and are poised to stay atop the industry.GrubHub DeliveryAs noted in the previous conference call, GRUB is working with restaurant partners to offer delivery options for restaurants/eateries that are unable to self-deliver either due to resource or infrastructure constraints. In these cases, GRUB hopes to offer delivery services in exchange for a nominal service fee. There is currently a pilot program underway and it continues to expand.However, just because GRUB is offering a food delivery service does not mean it is a food delivery company. Offering delivery to restaurants that are not able to self-deliver is only a means to drive more cash flow and revenue through the online platform. The focus remains on growing the platform and generating positive cash flows. The CFO outlined the company's strategy for offering GrubHub Delivery:Clearly, management knows offering GrubHub Delivery is only a means to grow the platform. Given that the delivery business is ramping up, and its results are included in consolidated results, margins will appear to be shrinking as the segment is not as profitable as the platform. Hence, the appearance of lower margins due to the GrubHub Delivery ramp up does not mean the core business is less profitable.It's crucial to note that the main aim is to break-even on the delivery business while making the real margin and profits on commissions collected from orders made on the platform. While we expect margins to continue shrinking due to a further roll out of GrubHub Delivery, we do not expect shares to come under further pressure due to this factor because the market seems to have priced in its misinterpretation of lower margins following Q3 results.As outlined and confirmed by GRUB's CEO, the company collects a nominal fee per delivery to cover the cost of delivery while making the same 14% take-rate from each order. If there is sufficient volume in deliveries, GRUB could even charge no additional expenses to deliver for bigger national or regional chains (assuming the increased volume allows it to compensate for these costs).By starting off with a pilot phase for national chains that have an aggregate of 2,500 stores across the country, it is testing the viability of this concept in markets where conditions are prime and where the concept would be the most effective. From the latest conference call, the venture is paying off thus far; diner retention, order frequency and order growth show strong trends in secondary markets where GRUB is making deliveries.In cases where delivery is simply not viable due to high costs in a particular market or low volumes, management would simply choose not to offer it for those markets or locations, thus focusing on those that generate a favorable return. We believe this approach is sound even though margins may be pressurized in the short-term as it invests in this venture.Bears argue that the fact that GRUB has to grow the platform through ordering deliveries may be a sign of slowing growth, a sign that it needs to offer these additional services to attract more restaurants. While there is some merit to this argument, the important thing to note here is that this is only a supplementary growth strategy. The company's success does not hinge on offering delivery services. With the food takeout and delivery industry worth roughly $70B (take this figure with a pinch of salt), GRUB has plenty of room to expand even without this offering. Note that the concept is still very much in a pilot testing phase, and yet GRUB's growth rate is holding up well.Moreover, keep in mind that by offering GrubHub Delivery, GRUB is able to sign up restaurants that would otherwise not be able to partner with it. Though bears would argue this strategy results in a low ROA, it does not diminish the profitability of the platform, as the 14% take from online orders would still flow to the bottom line at a high margin.Whilst it is a fact that higher-margin expansion comes from partnering with restaurants that already have their own delivery services in place, GRUB would be missing a large piece of the market if it did not offer delivery services, particularly those markets it already operates in anyway. From that context, we believe the decision to expand into delivery services makes sense. After all, there are numerous advantages (other than increasing growth) associated with offering its own delivery service.Taking on deliveries also allows the company to ensure a high standard associated with the GrubHub brand, especially when it comes to delivery times and reliability. The CEO spoke on this issue:Ultimately, a brand is about incorporating implicit promises. An implied guarantee of lower delivery times and higher reliability associated with the GrubHub brand ensures customers are more likely to order on its app/website compared with alternatives offered by competitors. This also ensures restaurants prefer to work with GRUB over other competitors.Furthermore, because the company's aim is just to break even on deliveries, it is much more difficult for smaller, fledgling food delivery businesses competing in the same field given that they have to make a profit despite having a very similar cost structure.From the perspective of larger national chains, GRUB's delivery network, if successfully scaled, will offer them an additional incentive to have their orders processed through the platform. This is attractive to the restaurants because GRUB is offering them more sales and profits at no hassle. Effectively, GrubHub Delivery enhances their value proposition and gives them an edge in terms of growth and marketing.Ultimately, the strategy is sound, but the results of this will be determined by GRUB's execution; it still runs the risk of botching the entire venture should the logistics fail. It's too early to tell if the pilot program will work as well in other markets, but GRUB seems to have the experience and resources to make it work.CompetitionThus far, the strong profitability of the food aggregation and delivery business has attracted competitors such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, we note again that GRUB does not make its money from food deliveries, the company makes money through its ordering platform. Even for closer competitors, GRUB possesses some key advantages over new players that are late to the party. We look at the two most relevant case studies to illustrate this point.Firstly, GRUB's offering of over 30,000 local restaurants (and expanding) are the single largest network of eateries on one platform. Yelp's Eat24 platform does not have the same scale whilst the press release claims it offers access to over 20,000 food outlets. The number of ratings and downloads on its app are roughly half of GrubHub's, suggesting that the latter platform is more popular.Furthermore, Eat24's revenues are only a fraction of GRUB's. According to acquisition disclosures, Yelp bought Eat24 at 3.7x projected 2015 revenue, which means Eat24 would only generate roughly $36.4M in revenue this year, roughly 10% of GRUB's projected 2015 revenue. Hence, in terms of both revenue and the depth of offerings, Yelp's Eat24 does not match up to GRUB's platform.Moreover, Yelp is a review site, not an ordering site. The touted synergies that its acquisition of Eat24 was supposed to generate are overstated given that Eat24 would still have to pitch to independent restaurants to join its platform. Having Yelp listings to work with may help speed up the process, but then again listings on Yelp are available to everyone - there's nothing proprietary about that information. Yelp's reputation as a review site also prevents people from looking at Yelp as an ordering site as its identity is firmly entrenched as a place for reviews, not ordering. Integration may be in the works, but it'll take a long time, whereas GRUB has a bigger and more seamless platform that was the earliest innovator in the food ordering and delivery sphere.A larger player like Amazon faces the same obstacles - scale, efficiency and experience, all of which GRUB has more of. Furthermore, when we actually look at what Amazon's food delivery business comprises, it is quite different from what GRUB offers. Amazon focuses more on generic snacks and food such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream, pizzas and popcorn, which are quite different from what GRUB offers - freshly cooked food from local restaurants. In essence, there is little overlap between the two offerings. Amazon's fresh food delivery is targeted more against grocery chains and convenience stores rather than GRUB.There is some chatter, however, about Amazon's restaurant delivery service that was rolled out in Seattle. When we delve into the details, however, the service is extremely limited as of now, with only a dozen or so local restaurants being involved. Also, the service is only limited to select zip codes and available only to Amazon Prime customers. That leads us to think that instead of scaling the project to a food delivery service for the masses, Amazon is keeping it as a ""value-added"" service for Prime subscribers that already use its platform for most of their grocery and shopping needs.Moreover, no matter how well capitalized a competitor is, they face the same obstacle of having to approach local restaurants and convince them to become a partner. Essentially, newer rivals like Amazon have to replicate the slow and arduous process that took GRUB several years before growth really took off.Therefore, the two case studies above show that despite signs that competition may heat up in this space, GRUB has the staying power and certain advantages over newer players. A key determinant of GRUB's eventual success will be its ability to scale quickly into the restaurant app.Bears, like this contributor, point out that there is a deluge of newer niche competitors like Blue Apron, Munchery, Freshly and Favor which seems to indicate intense competition. However, the bear analysis completely misses the point that these new startups are not direct competitors.For instance, Blue Apron offers a delivery service that sends ingredients (not ready-to-eat meals) to a customer's home. Munchery offers quick microwaveable meals (not local restaurant or eatery food). Freshly specifically appeals to the Paleo diet, not mass consumption. Favor has a completely different business model in that it charges the customer a flat fee instead of a percentage-based commission taken from the restaurant (it is also much, much smaller).However, the bear case continues that even though none of them compete directly with GRUB, they still compete for the same customers. This is flawed reasoning because these services appeal to fundamentally different needs. Let's say a consumer wants to make some healthy, fresh food themselves. Blue Apron is the perfect choice for their needs. However, in a world where Blue Apron didn't exist, will their dollars go to GRUB instead? No. Because they'll simply go out and buy ingredients from grocery stores. Fundamentally, although there may be some overlap, the needs and demographic that each of these niche food delivery business appeals to is quite different. Someone who is keen on a Paleo diet isn't going to order takeout from GRUB simply because a service like Freshly doesn't exist. He'll simply have to take the trouble to walk into a supermarket to buy his ingredients for his specialized diet.It's easy to buy into the gloom and doom without actually looking at the details of these newer startups. There's quite a simple, logical explanation to why potential competitors would not want to go head to head with GRUB: there is plenty of low-hanging fruit elsewhere. Instead of increasing the competition, which would mean margin compression for everyone involved, there is still great potential in smaller, niche markets that are relatively untouched by GRUB, and those are the more likely places that newer competitors will move into.This explanation makes sense when we consider that even bigger players like Amazon prefer to focus on the grocery delivery space and offering food delivery as a value-added service for Prime customers only.Thus, once we take a closer look at the profile of competitors, it seems fears of intense competition are at least slightly overblown, as many competitors are nowhere near GRUB's scale, and most do not compete directly in GRUB's target market.Buyout PotentialThe question to ask is: Can someone replicate GRUB's entire business in a short period of time with less than the value of its market cap today? We firmly believe the answer is no.The crucial factor here is time. GRUB is growing at a tremendous pace despite already being the largest in its market. This is due to the ongoing first-mover effect and the advantage in scale it possesses over its competitors. For someone to replicate the entire business, it would take at least a few years, by which time GRUB would have grown to be even bigger. Furthermore, with the current price tag of ~5.5x 2015 revenue, its valuation comes very close to much smaller competitors that were acquired recently (Eat24 was acquired for 3.7x revenues and is 10 times smaller than GRUB in terms of revenue), and is the cheapest it has been in years.Specifically, we believe there is one company that would be very tempted by GRUB's current share price: Priceline Group. PCLN acquired a very similar business - OpenTable - for $2.6B cash in 2014. OpenTable's history of growth is similar to GRUB. Its home market has always been the US, but it has since expanded to other regions including Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, etc. We believe PCLN has indicated its desire to move into this space, and GRUB fits squarely in its strategy, with plenty of synergies with previous acquisitions.GRUB could be integrated with OpenTable's current operations to offer diners an entire suite of services, and this would create a business with the identity of being the one-stop for both dine-in and takeout experiences. Furthermore, with Priceline's current base of customers from its existing accommodation and travel services, it could easily cross sell GRUB's offerings and expand them to other regions. However, we do believe the fact that GRUB's offerings are fairly limited to the US and London may make it less attractive for a global bookings business like PCLN.Given the obvious synergies and low price tag after the tremendous drop in GRUB's share price, it is difficult to believe PCLN is not already considering a bid for the company. It would be the next logical step for its expansion into the restaurant bookings space, and integrates well with the portfolio of existing businesses.Whilst we have focused on Priceline being a potential competitor, we also see GRUB being attractive to other bigger players, including Amazon. Given the compelling value at these levels, we find it hard to believe that managements are not already considering this notion.ValuationFor much of GRUB's post-IPO history, the stock price has experienced massive swings, rising as high as $47/share from its IPO price of $26/share and dropping back to current levels (~$24).Whilst its valuation may have looked frothy and excessive in the past year, the price now significantly undervalues the company, particularly when we take into account understated margins and a sustained high growth rate.With most fast-growing mid-cap disruptors, valuation is difficult due to multiple moving parts and uncertain factors. Hence, we keep our thinking simple: on a qualitative basis, we ask what kind of scenario the market is pricing in, and whether performance is likely to exceed that scenario. On a quantitative basis, we look at revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins and cash flow.QualitativeExpectations are fairly low after the Q3 earnings report, as the share price has factored in margin compression, with the market anticipating a slowing growth rate compared to previous years. Together with our analysis in the earlier part of the article, we believe the worst-case scenario (or something close) has already been priced in as investors bailed out of the stock at record pace. From the sell side, price targets and growth forecasts have been cut aggressively.Quantitative(Note: Figures are nominal, i.e. undiscounted. We also ignored effects of potential acquisitions or large increases in debt load. In essence, the model assumes a steady-state organic expansion).For the base case, we used conservative inputs by modeling revenue growth falling at 5%/year with a starting point of 35% in 2016. EBITDA margins were taken at 28.5% in 2016 and increases by 2.5%/year. We believe this is consistent with the economics of GRUB's business, as the margins are likely to widen with scale. This has been consistent with past trends as EBITDA margins have consistently risen from 20.68% in FY2013 to 26.78% in 2015 Q3 on a trailing 12-month basis.For the bear case, we modeled a linear revenue growth of +$110M/year with a 26% EBITDA margin for the entire duration. This assumed growth trajectory would take on a linear form and grow much slower than previous years.For the bull case, we assumed growth rate will stay constant at 45% starting 2016, and that EBITDA margins will expand by 3% a year beginning in 2016. These metrics are relatively conservative given that EBITDA for 2015 was radically understated due to much higher optional marketing and ad expenses.From the above model, we believe at its current market cap of ~$2B, GRUB is trading at great value given the projections. Even in the bear case, GRUB's multiples seem fairly reasonable for a company which holds the dominant position in a ~$70B market. In the bull case, GRUB trades for 5x 2018 EBITDA, a steal for a company with an immensely attractive business model.For EBITDA margins, we believe higher EBITDA margins is a reasonable assumption given the trend of growing margins as the platform scaled over the past few years. Furthermore, the margins this quarter were impacted by unusual items such as higher-than-anticipated investment into GrubHub Delivery (which management says will shrink in the next year) and website outages.(Source: YCharts)In the end, valuation models for growth companies like GRUB have to be taken with a pinch of salt. The bottom line is this: if you believe in the growth story, buy the stock. If you do not believe it can continue expanding and hold the dominant position in this industry, don't buy it.ManagementWe think it's always a good sign when the founder of a start-up continues to run the company. For GRUB, that is exactly what happened as the CEO remains the co-founder who started the enterprise in 2004 - that's more than 11 years at the helm of his own creation (he was profiled here). Furthermore, the merger of GRUB and Seamless brought together two management teams with extensive experience in the same arena. Currently, GRUB's CFO and General Counsel were ex-Seamless employees.We acknowledge that the heavy insider selling recently is disconcerting. It certainly does not instill confidence in investors. However, there are several key points to note with regard to this. Firstly, the main open-market sellers have been directors who acquired shares through private financing rounds before the company IPO'ed, hence they are obviously eager to cash out now that the company's value has increased multifold. Second, although the CEO has consistently sold shares upon options exercise, the level of ownership is fairly consistent. We believe the old saying here applies: they may sell for many reasons, but they only buy for one. Regardless, this is an area of concern that should continue to be monitored. Whilst the data here is not conclusive, the record of insider selling is certainly a negative.ConclusionGRUB is currently in a unique situation where the market does not fully understand the attractive fundamentals of the business. Furthermore, multiple one-off headwinds and a misinterpretation of the company's health due to Q3 results have provided a low entry point for shares in a company that is already profitable with a massive potential for growth. If our thesis holds, we believe GRUB's share price has the potential to compound multifold over the next few years. Long GRUB."
3610526,22148,2015-10-27T18:06:26-04:00,GrubHub crashes following a not so surprising quarter of missing estimates and guiding down on growth estimates.Analysts remained too positive on the stock heading into earnings despite obvious competitive threats.The prediction remains that GrubHub faces more headwinds before the stock ultimately bottoms.,"My previous investment thesis warned GrubHub's (NYSE:GRUB) shareholders that they must weather the upcoming storm. A good company facing tough competition doesn't usually end well for those shareholders, at least over the short term.The takeout food ordering leader faces immense competition and a market shift toward a full ordering suite that includes online ordering and delivery. The combination leads to decelerating revenue growth while increasing expenses for the delivery service. Neither options alone are good for the stock. Together, it leads to a stock trading down over 20% to new all-time lows following a Q3 earnings miss and weak Q4 guidance.The difficult part is not understanding why the market didn't see it coming. Over the last few weeks, several analysts reiterated a buy on the stock, including Susquehanna Group, RBC Capital, and Brean. Remember, the stock had a valuation of over $2.5 billion, with revenue expectations of $364 million heading into Q3. Even a stock with a wide moat has a difficult time maintaining that type of valuation.With the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber, and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) aggressively entering the space in the last year, the logic didn't add up to paying lofty prices for GrubHub. The end result is the stock is down nearly 25% on a penny miss on Q3 earnings. The key being that net income only grew 13% YoY so expectations were already rather low regarding income growth.If anything, GrubHub made the mistake of coming out the IPO gate last year generating too many profits. The ability to generate 34% EBITDA margins to end last year only served to attract competition. Even this illustrative chart serves to attract more competition into the sector seeing these attractive economics for a service that is replicable.Source: GrubHubBased on the knowledge of competitive pressure and natural decelerating revenue as growth rates were destined to decline, it isn't surprising to see the PS multiple contract. Yelp provided the path earlier this year with a multiple that has bottomed nearly 50% lower than where GrubHub sits now. Yelp doesn't have the same profit margins of GrubHub and is in a slightly different market outside of the overlap with the Eat24 purchase. Regardless, the below chart highlights that GrubHub likely heads even lower before bottoming.GrubHub guided to a slight Q4 revenue miss, suggesting that even the existing deceleration to 29% revenue growth in 2016 is too high. Along with a stock hitting new lows, the quick target is to stay away from the stock until it trades closer to 3x the 2016 reduced revenues of around $450 million. If one thinks GrubHub eventually creates a national marketplace for online food ordering and delivery, an entry level closer to $15 makes the stock very intriguing.The key takeaway is that GrubHub follows a theme of numerous other previously hot IPOs. The stocks trade at lofty multiples out of the gate and eventually crash when growth decelerates. Typically, the business isn't always bad, creating an opportunity to scoop up cheap shares when market interest wanes. Right now, GrubHub is still in the middle of the crashing process so the recommendation is to wait until the stock starts losing analyst coverage or gets hit by several downgrades."
3834446,80285,2016-01-27T09:59:24-05:00,"GRUB's competitors are having trouble obtaining funding.UberEats is expanding to 10 different cities. Is this a threat to GRUB?GRUB announced a $100M share buyback and is committing to a $200M loan facility, yet the stock has reacted negatively.GRUB possesses several advantages over rivals and they should continue to expand whilst increasing cash flow.At these lower prices and with competitors facing difficulties, GRUB continues to be a solid buy.","BackgroundSince my previous write-up on GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), several events have taken place that were material to the company's prospects. Essentially, the food delivery space has gotten crowded very quickly, with Uber announcing the expansion of UberEats to 10 U.S. cities, and start-ups like DoorDash leading a new round of financing. Even start-ups in Asia from Singapore to India are raising funds to expand.On the flip side, investors and VCs have been placing pressure on these food delivery startups to deliver sustainable returns instead of purely growth. As evidence, a host of startups such as InstaCart, Swiggy and other smaller enterprises have begun raising fees and even laying off staff. Also, DoorDash, one of the major players in the U.S. food delivery market, have been forced to lower their fund-raising target as investor appetite has declined. With the numerous startups focusing on food delivery, the market is now objectively crowded. Yet the entire model relies on scaling in clustered (local) regions in order to achieve profitability and remain competitive.Also, earlier today GRUB announced they would be initiating a $100M share buyback and committing to a $200M credit facility so that they can return capital to shareholders and still retain the flexibility to invest aggressively. We think recent events have changed the outlook for GRUB and other food delivery startups as it clearly differentiates GRUB as the best bet in a crowded industry.The Two Different Types Of Food Delivery StartupsAn enduring misunderstanding when discussing the food delivery industry is the notion that all food delivery startups are similar. The truth is there are really broadly two types: customer acquisition-focused and logistics-focused startups.For instance, GRUB began as a CA-focused business with most restaurant partners doing their own deliveries and leveraging the GRUB and Seamless brands/platform as a way to generate incremental sales. Unlike other startups like DoorDash and BlueApron, they did not involve themselves in the logistics of food delivery or preparation. With the testing and rollout of GrubHub Delivery for certain markets and selected partners, GRUB is moving into this space in a limited way. However, at its core it remains a customer-acquisition company because most restaurants in their network self-deliver and do not rely on GRUB to provide and organize drivers or vehicles.The other model, which is used by startups like DoorDash, involves taking over the logistics completely, targeting restaurants and eateries that do not have the ability or desire to self-deliver to customers. This model is much more capital-intensive and difficult to expand due to several reasons. Obviously with handling drivers and vehicles, the costs are bound to be higher. But more importantly, the logistics can only be scaled efficiently if the company is able to have a dominant presence in a local region which enables it to generate consistently higher order volumes to make it worthwhile to hire drivers. The cost per delivery can only come down significantly when pick-up and drop-off locations are in the same area, which allows for fast multiple trips.Given this, it is clear that this model would not be viable in some areas where the average delivery distances are greater or where they are unable to generate enough order flow to compensate for the cost of the vehicle and driver. Hence, many of these food delivery startups and wildly overestimating their addressable market. We think GRUB is also guilty of this, albeit to a lesser extent.Our point is this - compared to logistics-based peers, GRUB has the advantage of starting off from an easily scalable CA-focused model, and the decision to rollout GrubHub Delivery in select markets to partner with bigger franchise owners makes perfect sense when one considers the fundamental economics of the industry. With the platform already in place, every new restaurant added to the network with the ability to self-deliver will provide higher margins for GRUB because there is almost no marginal cost for adding new restaurants to the platform. Moreover, it is much easier for GRUB to be profitable on the deliveries that they do handle since partnering with franchisors that own a chain of local restaurants would probably result in higher order volume and deliveries concentrated in a single area.The Threat From UberUber's decision to expand UberEats to 10 cities across the U.S. is not much of a threat to GRUB due to their late timing, a poor compensation scheme for drivers and the lack of a dedicated food delivery fleet.Uber is late to the game and trying to get market share in cities that are already very crowded. GRUB has a dominating presence in most of these geographies including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston. These are places where GRUB has widespread brand awareness and have partnered with numerous local restaurants, making it very difficult for UberEats to unseat them. Moreover, there are a slew of startups already meeting this need in these places, and Uber isn't offering anything above and beyond to incentivize restaurant partners or customers.Also, Uber's compensation scheme doesn't make it worthwhile for the drivers. The company mentioned that they will charge $5 per delivery, of which a portion would go to the driver. Assuming Uber takes their usual 20% and leaves $4 for the driver, they would need to make at least 4 deliveries per hour to make it worthwhile as they pay for their own expenses. In New York, for instance, where the average Uber driver makes ~$29 per trip, they would have to make over 7 deliveries to earn the same amount as they would for one typical trip. The process of getting out, getting food, getting back in could also prove to be a little too troublesome. Simply put, we don't think this is attractive from the perspective of drivers.Moreover, Uber's idea is to locate a driver in the vicinity when an order is ready and give them the option of picking it up. The natural question arises: what if there are no available drivers nearby? What if drivers are busy during rush hour with passengers? Without a dedicated delivery force, there are numerous hiccups that could occur, and we all know how angry customers can get when their food shows up late. This could compound into all sorts of smaller issues, such as the process of physically picking up an order from the restaurant. As a different driver can be expected to make each delivery, the hand-off process between the restaurant staff and driver can be quite tedious, especially if they need to park, physically walk in, take the food out and head back to the vehicle.Lastly, most of GRUB's revenues are generated from restaurants that already have the ability to self-deliver and are using GRUB's platform as a means of generating incremental sales. This portion of their business will be largely untouched by Uber's advances. The main fight will take place for restaurants that are unable to self-deliver, and we think owners would prefer a partner with a dedicated delivery workforce compared to a large number of ad-hoc delivery drivers.Competitors Are Showing WeaknessDoorDash is perhaps GRUB's biggest and most direct competitor in several markets across the U.S. Their latest fundraising troubles could indicate that private equity appetite for food delivery startups is finally declining after funding surged in 2014 and 2015. As the industry becomes much more crowded, investors seem to be demanding more sustainability and concrete returns, presumably to allow for an exit strategy via higher pricing at IPO. Private valuations for GRUB's competitors have always been bloated in comparison to GRUB's publicly-listed shares, and this gap may be finally narrowing.This is meaningful for several reasons. If valuations are being compressed in the private equity market, that means investors aren't seeing enough upside to invest additional funds. Given that these startups continue to consume capital without breaking even, some could end up like Good Eggs, which announced in August that it would shut down all operations outside San Francisco and lay off over half of its staff.GRUB Is Flush With Cash, And Is Getting MoreGRUB announced today that they will secure $200M in loans and initiate a buyback programme for up to $100M, as well as appoint two new independent directors to strengthen the board. Given that GRUB already has ~$295M in cash, we think this is a tax-effective way of boosting shareholder returns and should restore some confidence after disappointing results in the past few quarters.In addition to their large cash hoard, GRUB generates a large amount of free cash flow for a startup, with FCF on a trailing basis at $47M (excluding the change in payment timing to restaurants). None of GRUB's competitors are even generating sustainable returns, and we think the new $100M share buyback shows management's willingness to return capital to shareholders. We would expect this programme to be increased if GRUB continues to produce FCF at these levels.As mentioned earlier, GRUB's competitors are having difficulty obtaining funding, whereas GRUB is flush in cash. This should translate to an operational advantage in terms of customer acquisition as well as rolling investing in GrubHub Delivery through new vehicles and/or drivers. Ultimately, scale is the key determinant of success in the food delivery space, and GRUB is not only the biggest but most profitable from a cash flow point of view. This should enable them to sustain a competitive advantage at least in the short/medium term.ValuationGRUB generates between $45M and $65M in annual free cash flow, which amounts to a P/FCF multiple of ~24 excluding cash, which is a decent figure considering that GRUB is still in the growth phase, with revenues increasing by 46% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, given the network-based economics of its app, there is almost no marginal cost from adding new restaurant partners to the platform and hence the new fees collected flow directly to the bottom line.Being a value investor, I do have reservations regarding the higher multiples at which GRUB trades compared to the stocks in my portfolio. However, these numbers must always be weighed against the company's future prospects, and GRUB should continue to execute upon its proven model which has helped the business grow into the biggest food delivery outfit in the U.S.ConclusionRecent events have made GRUB even more attractive. The expansion of UberEats is not a serious threat as they have a problematic model that will be difficult to implement. With the space getting more crowded, GRUB could face more competition but is well-equipped to handle it. We think in the long-term, GRUB should stand out in the industry and remain the top dog. In the meantime, lower investor confidence in the industry could spillover to affect its share price.Since our previous write-up, the share price has fallen ~24% (as of writing) largely because GRUB, like most technology stocks, is high-beta and moves with the market at a larger magnitude most of the time. Also, we are befuddled by the market's initially positive, then negative reaction to GRUB's share buyback announcement. Nonetheless, we think the fall in share price has made it more attractive and are comfortable accumulating a larger position at these levels."
3522616,22148,2015-09-22T00:04:55-04:00,GrubHub continues to face an onslaught of competition including a real threat from Amazon.The stock continues to trade at premium valuations despite the recent sell-off.Shareholders will have to weather more volatility and likely downside until GrubHub beats back competitive threats.,"When one looks at the GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) revenue growth in comparison to the stock, a huge disconnect appears. In the current private market environment though, it isn't a huge shock that a hot IPO is trading down at the lows after going public over a year ago. Private companies are obtaining higher valuations than the comparative public stocks, providing some long-term opportunity once the stock gets beaten up in the public markets.The biggest issue with GrubHub is that the hot money has poured into the sharing economy that includes food delivery with a ton of startups. Even big names like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and car-ride service Uber are aggressively moving into the space. In the last six months, GrubHub is down roughly $20 from the all-time peak. Has GrubHub seen enough pain to buy at the current price around $27.50?High Margins Attract CompetitionThe typical silicon valley stock comes out with low margins and a lack of profits with the hope of scaling into large profits down the road. The lack of profits can help provide a buffer to discourage new competition. In the case of GrubHub, the food ordering and delivery service is already very profitable. The combination of a hot concept and strong profits is the recipe for intense competition.The previous article provided a chart with a whole host of competition from chef on demand to grocery delivery to food delivery. Each category is already highly competitive with the food delivery section listing the largest amount of companies. Unfortunately for GrubHub, the company is mostly focused on online ordering that improves ordering quality, but it underinvested in the food delivery part that is hot now.According to Cowen, Amazon is joining that sector with tests in Seattle for Prime customers. With GrubHub only controlling a roughly $75 million in annual food sales run-rate by Q4 compared to competition excluding Amazon with $500 million, it is very vulnerable to competition in this area. Most restaurants just aren't going to want online ordering only.During Q2, GrubHub generated EBITDA margins of 32.3% and adjusted operating income of 19.3%. Those margins are relatively high for a competitive environment. A big reason for the high margins is that despite being a tech-related stock, the company only spent $7.9 million on the technology expense category during the quarter with revenue of $88.0 million. Not to mention, the technology spend only increased 30% YoY during the quarter versus 47% revenue growth.It appears inevitable that GrubHub will need to increase spending on not only technology spending that includes research and development, but also more sales and marketing to maintain that lead. The increasingly competitive landscape requires the company to spend to develop and improve products and increase marketing to drown out all of the competitors.Remember that one of the downfalls of the 3-D printing stocks was the need to increase spending to compete with a new large entrant into the market that hurt margins. The lower margins amongst other issues eventually crushed the stocks that were very profitable.The constant push of Amazon and Uber into the sector may or may not change the outcome of GrubHub as the market leader, but it does likely change the profit profile. Neither new entrant is known for a focus on the bottom line.Stretched ValuationIf one could build a case that GrubHub will increase or even expand margins, the current valuation is easily justified. The stock trades at roughly 33x 2016 EPS estimates of $0.84 that isn't overly expensive for fast growth.In the last quarter, the EPS more than doubled with the expanded margins. Analysts also forecast earnings growing at a near 30% clip over the next five years. One has to question the likelihood of GrubHub maintaining the bottom line growth with the competition onslaught.Using a collaboration of stocks including Amazon entering the sector, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) that bought competitor Eat24, and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) that faced a similar profit and margin decline scenario, the general conclusion is that it is impossible to maintain the PS ratio at levels near 10x forward sales.GRUB PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAll of the comparative stocks have seen the sales multiples collapse to below the 5x level after trading at much higher levels. In the case of Yelp and Stratasys, the stocks traded at multiples higher than 10x revenues as recently as last year. GrubHub is headed for a similar fate.TakeawayFor now, shareholders of GrubHub will have to weather the storm of an onslaught of competition. With the stock trading at a premium valuation reserved for companies with dominant market positions with wide moats, the likelihood is more downside for the stock. At the very least, the stock could trade sideways for another year as revenue growth chips away at the large multiples. Either way, the current entry point isn't attractive for GrubHub until the likely margin pressures subside down the road."

Ouch.Although operations are improving, we worry that more and more of GrubHub's restaurants are going to be tempted away by Amazon's no-fee model.","We've explained why we're hard to please, when it comes to stock picking. We're very selective. Just like possession is nine-tenths the law, similarly we believe that the preservation of capital is nine-tenths successful investing.It's simply a mathematical reality: large losses are very hard to recover from. Just think about it: if you lose 50% in a position, you'll need to gain 100% just to break even. We don't want that pain. That's why we spend so much time weeding out companies that we consider to be optimistically priced.So that's why it's rare when we have good - or even neutral - news with which to update our readers.Back in January, we wrote our bearish piece on GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) titled ""GrubHub: 5 Reasons To Avoid It."" In this article, we outline five reasons investors should avoid GrubHub, including an artificially high growth rate, seasonal concerns, tight competition, and more. Satisfyingly, the stock's down over 26% since the time of publication.Source: YChartsWhen a stock drops so much, it's appropriate to review our thesis. So let's take a moment to look anew at a GrubHub.The GoodGrubHub makes it money by charging restaurants a commission when customers book an order through its site. GrubHub has seen impressive growth in customers, takeout orders, and food sales.Source: Company 10-QGrubHub is gleaning more and more profit from its sales, as it attracted new users and increased takeout orders, and it shows. Here's an impressive chart we don't see everyday:Source: YChartsGrubHub is increasingly converting its revenue into profit for shareholders. That's excellent.The BadWith a P/E of 63.3 and a forward P/E of 32.3, its one-year earnings growth rate is forecast at ~86.36%.Source: Zacks.comFortunately, considering that GrubHub has a decent history of meeting its earnings forecasts, we don't think this is overly optimistic.Nevertheless, we feel it's still priced optimistically. As we pointed out in our last article, GrubHub has no monopoly with only 1% more relationships than its next closest competitor, Yelp's Eat24.com. Unfortunately for GrubHub, our fears of increased competition have borne out: The era of McDelivery is upon us; Amazon launched a food service, and a large portion of restaurants list on that site and not on GrubHub. Naturally, competition with Amazon will eat into GrubHub's growth. As we know, GrubHub makes it money by charging restaurants a commission when customers book an order through its site. More troubling for GrubHub, $245B megacap Amazon can afford to not charge any service or delivery fees on its deliveries, taking a cut on orders--GrubHub's bread and butter.The real risk here is that if GrubHub continues to meet the market's forecast, what happens? Not much. The stock will stay flat--or rise a bit and drop. Simply, any good news is already ""baked in"" to the price.And what'll happen if things get worse for GrubHub: dilatory customers, unexpectedly great weather going into the fall (customers get takeout in bad weather, not nice weather), and competitors like Amazon put downward pressure on GrubHub's margins? Well, that'll be painful for GrubHub investors. Shares fall.ConclusionSo what to do? We ourselves are torn. These are lots of reasons to like GrubHub. GrubHub has shown impressive revenue and net income growth, with a savvy and honest management team that understands the needs of the online ordering market.Unfortunately, we believe that GrubHub continues to present too much risk to shareholders. GrubHub has much less room to handle downturns than its larger competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon can afford to not charge any service or delivery fees, which cuts to the core of GrubHub's business model. We worry that more and more of GrubHub's restaurants may defect to Amazon's no-fee model. For this reason, we're switching to neutral on the stock. While we believe there are some positives here, the future (unknowable) risks are too great for us to advocate buying the shares. Investors: we recommend that you wait and see how the landscape looks before buying shares of GrubHub."
3458756,91235,2015-08-21T15:00:34-04:00,"GrubHub yet again delivered stellar quarterly results, but investors were less than impressed, based on the subsequent stock price movement.A number of reasons may account for the lack of immediate upside.Fundamentalists should be excited about the stock’s lack of response to the great quarterly financials.","This article serves as an update to a previous article I wrote about GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB).As investors know, GrubHub, Inc. is a disruptor within the food industry. Although individual restaurants can deliver to their customers' homes, never before has such a company assisted the delivery and catering services of so many restaurants. With the merger of GrubHub and Seamless and the acquisitions of several other food delivery companies, GrubHub seems poised to be the dominant force pushing forward innovation in the industry.But it looks like investors are beginning to have doubts about the Company's prospects. Since the Company's IPO in April 2014, the Company's stock has traded sideways, and most recently, the Company's stock has breached new lows, currently trading at just about $30.00 a share.Source: Stockcharts.com.Are investors justified about their mixed feelings for GrubHub? Although the Company has delivered outstanding financial results for the past several quarters, investors seem unimpressed about what the Company has to offer. The Company's Q2 results depict yet another excellent quarter for the Company, which investors have decidedly declared less-than-stellar.All the Company's financials saw enormous increases year-on-year. Revenues jumped 47% from 2014 Q2; EBITDA grew more than 65% year-on-year; and net income shot up a whopping 247%. The Company's key metrics displayed the same growth characteristics: Active Diners increased by 42%; Daily Average Grubs advanced by 26%; and Gross Food Sales swelled by 34%. All-in-all, Q2 was another great quarter for the Company.Besides the growth that the Company has been accomplishing, it also continues to work on streamlining its operations and making investments in infrastructure. GrubHub announced the achievement of two great milestones: the upgrade of seamless to a new interface and the doubling of markets that the Company operates in.With the growth that the Company has experienced in this quarter, the Company projects that it will earn revenue in the range of $358M - $364M (about a 42% increase year-on-year) and EBITDA in the range of $104M - $112M (about a 59% increase year-on-year) for the full fiscal 2015 year. This projection is in line with the incredible growth rates that the Company has been able to achieve in the years since its IPO, which averaged around a 61.2% CAGR.So with all the good news, why has the stock price dipped so much? Perhaps it's due to speculators and short-term investors becoming impatient with the stock's lack of performance. Or perhaps it's due to the Company's overvaluation. After all, with such a rapidly growing company, the stock won't come cheap. The Company's P/E TTM ratio is almost double that of the industry average at 69.3 (according to Morningstar), and its P/S ratio also indicates that the Company is overvalued. The market may be starting to correct for this large overvaluation.But this overvaluation may not be such a bad thing. To me, the stock's near-double P/E TTM ratio compared to the industry indicates that the stock is a momentum stock. As a result, should the Company make any missteps in its next several quarters, the stock will likely experience a sharp decline in the near- to mid-term. Such a decline may make the stock come into a more realistic valuation range, and long-term fundamentalist investors, like me, will be able to scoop up this stock for a bargain. It's actually somewhat of a disappointment that GrubHub has done so well this quarter, as now I'll have to wait even longer to open a position in this fast-growing, industry-disrupting company."

To date, it has been impressively managed and operated. They merged with their biggest competitor, Seamless, to dominate restaurant food delivery in major markets, like New York and Chicago. Their profitable rollout plan has been solid.A not-famous German general once said ""no plan survives contact with the enemy."" And their enemies are multiplying.GrubHub CompetitorsGrubHub's small competitors have collectively raised over $650 million. The fundraising table below does not even include the four big players that have all recently entered the space: Uber (Pending:UBER), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Square. Those companies have raised billions collectively.GrubHub (and its subsidiary, Seamless) is well positioned relative to these new entrants. But these new entrants are living by Jeff Bezos' famous mantra: ""Your margin is my opportunity."" For GrubHub, revenue will be pressured, it may even fall in the next couple quarters. Profits will be squeezed as GrubHub will step up promotional activity to combat the new entrants. Recently, for example, they raised their introductory coupons from $7 to $10.The good news is that this space seems to be experiencing tremendous secular and geographic growth. Obviously, takeout and delivery are not new. However, in the past, either the delivery options were limited (pizza, Chinese), ordering was inconvenient and takeout was just a huge waste of travel time. These services are rushing to fill this void and consumers are loving the newfound convenience… and of course the venture capital funded promotions. The most important point is that the winners have not yet been solidified with challengers on all sides.Challengers from Below: Doordash, Delivery.com, PostMates and Favor. A year ago I would have guessed that GrubHub/Seamless had the market locked up. Bam. Then came Doordash. This YCombinator company is in the process of crushing GrubHub in the Bay Area market. Why? They don't just have restaurants that sign up with Doordash - they have EVERY restaurant that allows takeout. Including your favorite one. In the Bay Area, GrubHub's list is incomplete and on the whole subpar. GrubHub's restaurants outside of New York and Chicago have the whiff of adverse selection - restaurants that are not busy and not popular are more motivated to push takeout and delivery. The equivalent would be Uber only taking you to some places you want to go, but not your favorite places. Meanwhile, Doordash is expanding into other cities. Doordash's model is probably not sustainable as configured, but they will negotiate a revenue share with restaurants while stealing market share in the process. You can be sure all the other players on the competitors chart are watching the Bay Area closely. Below, you can see how successful Doordash, Eat24 and Munchery have been in gaining mind share in the Bay Area over the past couple of years.SF Bay Brawl: In the SF Bay Area, Doordash has blasted past GrubHub and Seamless in Google Searches. Eat24 and Munchery have made strong inroads as well.Battle for Seattle. Yelp's Eat24 currently leads the market for searches in Seattle (Doordash has not entered yet).Challengers from the Side: Munchery, Blue Apron, Sprig, Spoonrocket and Plated. These services will all eat into the home food delivery niche by providing a convenient but healthier alternative. While I'm somewhat skeptical of them given the quality of my personal experiences, these companies are motivated, funded and their products will get better.Challenges from BIG players: UberEats, Groupon To Go, Yelp's Eat24 and Square's Caviar. Yelp and Groupon are both very hungry for new sources of growth. Square and Uber are just plain aggressive competitors, although I wonder how committed they are to this space. The most established of these players is Yelp's Eat24. They have steadily grown share. With Yelp's marketing muscle and an existing sales force on the task, GrubHub should be worried. Meanwhile, Uber and Groupon all have massive traffic but do they have the operational excellence to take down GrubHub?Searches for Yelp, Uber and Groupon vs. GrubHub and Seamless in the US.Challengers from Abroad? Just-Eat and Delivery Hero are the GrubHub and Seamless of the international world. These two are probably not content with sitting out of the US market forever. Expect an acquisition (or three!) from these guys over the next two years.Execution Missteps. GrubHub and Seamless both grew well. But their integration after the merger has been slow. Just recently they relaunched in NY on a unified platform. It has not gone well. The analysts at Cowen did a survey indicating power users are shifting some spend away from Seamless. I have a friend in New York who was so annoyed by how bad the transition was that he has sworn off Seamless for now. He has plenty of options at this point and he is not alone in his complaints. Some more from Twitter as well: one, two and three.An expensive operational switch. Doordash, Postmates, Uber and others are leading the way in showing that the true drivers of the business are good food delivered quickly. GrubHub relied heavily on restaurants that delivered their own food and elected to sign up for their platform. This is the capital light eBay model and it is great if you have no competitors. But it may be the wrong strategy in this space as it results in slower deliveries from the second tier of restaurants. To its credit, GrubHub is starting to do its own deliveries. Robert Faulkner correctly points out that this shift doesn't have the same attractive economics as their original model. It will be another reason profits will be pressured.How much room is left for monetization? One of the impressive elements of GrubHub's business is its 15.5% take rate, or percent of each bill GrubHub gets, as of the latest quarter. It is probably why so many companies are attracted to the space. It is also a problem. Restaurants, the lifeblood of GrubHub's business, don't have a lot of margin to spare. They like the revenue they get from GrubHub, but I suspect GrubHub may have reached the limit of how much of the ticket they can take, since most restaurants average less than 4% overall margin. Interestingly, the take rate percent may increase over the coming quarters, but it will be an illusion, since it will likely come from delivery fees added as part of their shift to delivery on behalf of restaurants. Sure it's more revenue, with a much less profitable (profitless?) cost structure.Slowing growth? While I anticipate the true competitive impact to be felt over the next 6-12 months, the cracks are already showing in GrubHub's growth:Given that grubs per active diner, revenue per dine and take rates are all either declining or profit constrained, the only profit growth driver left will be new diners. GrubHub's competitors will be fighting for every one.The market is GrubHub's to lose, but it's worth laying out what conditions would cause GrubHub's stock to drop dramatically:Searches for ""Seamless"" in NYC. Saturating?If this market is winner-take-all, saturation is not near and take rates remain high - then whatever company wins, GrubHub or otherwise, will likely be worth a lot more than $2.6 billion. This is the bull case. Given the current competitive environment, there is high risk for GrubHub shareholders.What's next? Revenue declines, profit evaporation, mergers and perhaps irrelevance? I expect GrubHub's profitability will evaporate over the next 12 months. If it wants to win I would argue it should. The right strategy is probably to follow the Uber model and press their advantage with aggressive sales and marketing. The worst-case scenario would be an outright quarter over quarter revenue decline of 5%-10% or more. Some seasonal weakness is expected in Q3, but they have still grown revenue every quarter until Q2 2015! Given Grub's nosebleed 70 PE, growth worries can take the stock down pretty far, potentially well below its IPO price of $26.While I'm intrigued by the business model and think there is opportunity for geographical expansion, it will be a bloodbath for a while. The bloodbath may not end until many of these competitors abandon the market or go bust. Don't get me started on how ugly it would get if we have a recession. There will be a lot of M&A in the space - likely with tons of dilution for GrubHub shareholders. The biggest risk for GrubHub investors is that they are one of the eventual losers and become a footnote to this space, losing to Doordash or Yelp like Myspace to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or AltaVista to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Seems unlikely given their historical momentum, but as of now they are being out-executed."

Then, you have to commute, which takes another 45 minutes, and so by the time you're back home, it's almost 8 PM.And you have an empty kitchen staring at you. You're hungry, but too tired to cook.This scenario plays out all too often. These days, the 40-hour work week that we used to champion as the ideal number of hours for a work-life balance is all but a dream. Frequently, the average person must work 50, 60, or 70 hours to get ahead in his or her career, and there's simply no time to cook a decent meal. Furthermore, after you've dealt with difficult people all day long, you definitely don't want to deal with more people by ordering food through calling or going to a restaurant.Enter GrubHub, Inc. (NYSE: GRUB). Using GrubHub's online platform, which is available both through its corporate website and its mobile applications, a tired worker bee can quickly and easily order food and have it delivered to his or her address without having to interact with a single person. It's as simple as entering in your address, choosing what you like, and paying with your card. In other words, hassle-free food delivery. With Americans eating out as much as 4.2 times a week, the restaurant industry is only growing, and along with it, the food delivery industry will grow as well. A typical day will generate $1.9B in sales, and according to restaurant.org, growth in the industry is projected go from $586.7B in 2010 to $709.2B in 2015. Within the restaurant industry, GrubHub primarily targets independent restaurants, and they account for approximately $204B in sales in 2012 according to the Euromonitor. The Company believes that about 32.8% of these sales were for takeout.Although the restaurant industry is as old as time itself, it's going through a remarkable transformation with the age of the internet. Restaurants across the globe are adapting with online ordering and delivery; today, nearly one in four restaurants offer online ordering. With its merger with Seamless a few years ago, GrubHub is uniquely positioned to take advantage of an emerging market-online food ordering and delivery.Source: Stockcharts.comSince its IPO in early April last year, the stock price has been vacillating roughly between price barriers of $30.00 to $48.00 as a result of investor uncertainty. However, a cursory glance at the Company's financial statements shows a strong balance sheet and explosive growth in a number of key metrics. Although the Company is grossly overvalued, with a P/E TTM ratio of 88.0 in comparison to the industry average of 33.9 (according to Morningstar.com), this overvaluation is justified due to the enormous growth potential and solid fundamentals, as detailed below. With a base case intrinsic share price range of $120.00 - $150.00, GrubHub makes for an excellent GARP investment.FundamentalsAll of GrubHub's key metrics, including active diners, daily average grubs, and gross food sales, have grown immensely throughout the Company's inception. Active diners is defined as ""the number of unique diner accounts from which an order has been placed in the past twelve months."" This metric has exploded from 1,087,000 in March 2013 to 5,604,000 in March 2015, representing a CAGR of 115%.Source: GRUB SEC FilingsDaily average grubs and gross food sales followed the same theme. Daily average grubs exploded from 82,700 to 234,700, and gross food sales erupted from $188.3M to $589.9M.Source: GRUB SEC FilingsWhile these metrics indicate solid, healthy growth for the Company, other great things are happening behind the scenes as well. The Company recently implemented an additional revenue generating stream in which restaurants have the ability to pay more to appear in a more prominent position in their customers' searches through the Company's algorithms. Dividing the Company's revenue by its gross food sales yields a rough idea of its commission percentage, and investors can see that it has risen from 13.7% to 15.0%.Source: GRUB SEC FilingsNot only has GrubHub been immensely successful in expanding its revenues, but it has also done well on the margin-front. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing has seen the greatest improvement with its decline from 39.1% to 27.3%. Operations and support, technology, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization have all remained more or less in-line with historical values as a result of the Company's rapid growth as well as its recent acquisitions. All-in-all, operating margins have improved drastically from 10.2% to 26.4%.Source: GRUB SEC FilingsBalance sheet-wise, GrubHub is in great financial condition. With a current ratio of just over 2.5, plenty of cash on its balance sheets, an increasing retained earnings, and little to no long-term liabilities, GrubHub is free to fully leverage its abilities to grow rapidly.ValuationAlthough at first glance, GrubHub's revenue growth looks incredible, some of that growth has come from acquisitions. Thus, I adjusted the Company's last three years' worth of revenue growth to account for these acquisitions, yielding a more realistic outlook. Projected a DCF out for ten years using the exit multiple method, I estimated the Company's base case growth rate to decrease rapidly from 42.2% to 22.0% throughout fiscal year 2020. Then, the growth rate would decline more slowly to 13.0% by fiscal year 2025. Worst and management cases were worse and better variations upon this theme, respectively.The Company splits its expenses into five different categories that I consolidated into one operating margin. Based upon historical data, I expected this margin to improve drastically, modeling it to increase by 200 basis points year-on-year until fiscal year 2020. Then, margins would only improve by 50 basis points year-on-year for the next five years. D&A and capex were held constant at 8.7% and 3.0%, respectively, in-line with historical values. The tax rate was expected to quickly decrease from 42.0% to 35.0%, whereupon it was held constant. Working capital was expected to change modestly at a linear rate.The Company does not have much debt, so when calculating the WACC, the cost of equity was heavily favored. Adding a size premium derived from Ibbotson to the mix yielded a cost of equity of 12.2%, which lead to a WACC of 11.6%. Finally, comparables gave an EV/EBITDA TTM of 46.15 in comparison to the Company's EV/EBITDA TTM of 33.42.Adjusting my WACC and exit multiple by 1.0% and 1.0x in both directions respectively yielded a base case implied share price range of $120.00 - $150.00, an upside of around 350%.The management case yielded an even more optimistic outlook, with an implied share price range of $160.00 - $200.00, an upside of about 500%.Even in the worst case scenario, with markedly lower growth rates and margin improvement, my sensitivity analysis yielded an implied share price range of $65.00 - $85.00, an upside of around 150%.RisksThe Company mentioned that its biggest competitor was the traditional food ordering system. However, in my opinion, that does not represent much of a threat. I believe it is inevitable that online ordering will transform the restaurant industry, and GrubHub is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this transformation.The biggest threat to GrubHub is the threat of new entrants. Right now, there isn't any single significant company that competes directly with GrubHub except for perhaps the restaurant's own online ordering platforms. However, given the lucrative opportunities within this market, I would not be surprised if more competitors began entering and encroaching upon GrubHub's market share.Given that the Company merged with Seamless, an already well-known online food ordering platform, I believe the Company still has the advantage of being the first-mover, so any new entrants would have to take time to ramp-up their own platforms before being able to compete with GrubHub.ConclusionAt a 150% discount to its worst case implied share price, GrubHub is an excellent opportunity to get in on some of the leading consumer trends. As more and more restaurants begin to transition to online ordering, GrubHub's potential market will only grow. The Company's organic growth is outstanding, and it experienced drastic increases across all of its key metrics. Furthermore, GrubHub has markedly improved its operating margin in the span of just two years. Although the Company's P/E TTM ratio is 2.5x that of the industry average, fundamentals indicate that this overvaluation is justified. GrubHub would make an excellent GARP investment to complement any portfolio."

Not only did revenue come in above estimates, but daily average grubs came in at 222,100 for Q2. This was below our estimate, but still represents YoY growth of roughly 27%, and signals continued popularity of the GrubHub system.Moreover, it has been brought to our attention that the analyst at Cowen used a 900 order survey to arrive at his bearish conclusion that GRUB is losing traction in the takeaway delivery market. GRUB reported daily average grubs of 227,300 in the first 6 months of 2015. Essentially, the competition concerns were based off of less than 0.001% of GRUB's annual orders.We maintain that competition concerns do exist from other consolidated systems like put forth by Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Uber. We affirm, though, that these competitors do not have as much traction in the market as GrubHub, and have a ways to go to match GRUB's 227,300 orders per day. We believe GrubHub clearly and singularly sits atop the online delivery takeaway industry and, as of today, is best positioned to reap the rewards of this growing industry.We affirm a $41 fair value on the stock, driven by our conservative assumption that GRUB can attain 15% future revenue market share.

It was a hot IPO in November 2011, priced at $20 the night of November 3, opened at $28 the next day, and carried a solid triple-digit multiple on forward earnings for, maybe, 30 days. Despite what was touted as their scale in subscribers, sales force and merchant relationships, the company had a recurring series of execution issues and slowing growth throughout 2012.The stock closed that year at about $5 per share, rebounded north of $10 in 2013 and sits back at the mid-single digit neighborhood today (Source: CapitalIQ). Throughout that painful period for GRPN's investors I kept thinking, in the words of the immortal Gertrude Stein, ""there's no there there."" And that brings me to GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB)!I discovered GRUB riding the NYC subways in recent years, as their advertisements were one of the few constants one expected to see. So, just for jollies, over the last week or so I've taken a look at their fundamentals and find it hard to believe that investors aren't being taken for a ride.Once again, we had the hot IPO priced at $26 (April 3, 2014), opened at $40 the next day, and spent most of 2014 with a hefty triple-digit multiple. But, like GRPN, things have started to slow down.Let's look first at the most obvious concern investors should have for a stock sporting a 45x multiple on forward earnings. The company went public shortly after consummating a merger between Seamless and GRUB on August 8, 2013. Consequently, the first few quarters out of the gate look stellar from a growth perspective as you can see in Figure 1. However, as we anniversary the transaction, growth slows to less than half the prior rate, and with the announcement of the most recent quarter, we began to see selling pressure on the stock. What was a $45 stock with a 66x P/E on forward earnings on April 28, 2015, has given up about 30% of its value and now sits at the aforementioned 45x multiple. Based upon management guidance on the last conference call and adjusted for the two acquisitions completed in Q1/15, the organic revenue growth rate for Q2/15 looks to be down to the high 30% range. That's certainly solid but investors need to question if there's more bad news coming and I think there is.Figure 1: GRUB's Revenue Growth Rate (click to enlarge)Source: Company reportsGRUB, like many companies, gives investors metrics which it thinks is important. But, as I've noted previously, such benchmarks are of little value if they are not predictive of performance. GRUB's quarterly metrics - active diners, daily average GRUBs (i.e. orders) and gross food sales - actually raise a number of red flags for me about the leverage (or lack thereof) in the company's business model.As we see in Figure 2, gross food sales per average active diner has been declining for years. Some of this is likely attributable to the growth in consumer operations and away from corporate business in recent years. However, what it should demonstrate to investors as it slows is the increasingly difficult task of gaining market share in the $70 billion ""takeout"" market that management promotes as its TAM (total addressable market).Figure 2: Gross Food Sales/Average Active Diner (click to enlarge)Source: Company reportsIn Figure 3, we see daily average grubs per average active diner. Here again, the order rate has declined from prior years and appears to be flattening out around 4%. For whatever reason, diners are not availing themselves of the GRUB solution at higher rates despite how much management says they love it. With the penetration rate low, the company will likely see average daily GRUBs fall into the 20% growth range in the not too distant future. Some will argue that the company's expansion into what it defines as Tier-2 and Tier-3 geographies skews this number lower. Here we'd note that CFO Adam DeWitt commented on the frequency of usage that the company typically sees ""around the second or third month is really a good baseline in terms of activity."" If that's true, the market expansion should only have a very short-term impact and not be skewing this metric.Figure 3: Average Daily Grubs/Average Active Diner (click to enlarge)Source: Company reportsFigure 4 provides a window into the company's revenue generating capacity as it shows revenue per average active diner. Years ago, we saw the stronger impact of corporate business and the higher commissions on bigger tickets. But those numbers have declined meaningfully with the company now in the $15-$16 range per average active diner as consumers become an increasing part of the revenue mix. Again, for investors, this means bigger hurdles for revenue growth as each diner generates less revenue than in the past.Figure 4: Revenue/Average Active Diner (click to enlarge)Source: Company reportsI believe that GRUB's management thinks it has discovered another lever to pull to attract more diners and restaurants to their platform in the form of delivery services. Prior to the acquisitions of DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run in Q1/15, GRUB's focus was on restaurants that did takeout or self-delivery. Now they've acquired the two largest restaurant delivery services (RDS) in the county and plan to expand the offering to existing and new restaurants. While it sounds like a good idea on the surface, I found management providing conflicting commentary on the subject and I think investors are in for a negative surprise.To sell the idea to investors, management made the argument that:Sounds like a pretty good opportunity, no?But at the same time, they're trying to downplay the financial impact with statements like these:One minute it's the best thing since sliced bread and the next you don't need to worry about the impact because it's a long way off.But, in my opinion, you do need to worry! Why? Because margins are going to go down if they don't find some leverage in their model. They told you that on their Q4/14 conference call when the CFO said, ""…our cost of delivery will be offset by incremental revenue from the restaurant in the form of higher commission rates and any delivery fees paid by the diner.""Sorry, but if the delivery service doesn't earn an 18% operating profit (GAAP) not just offset its cash cost, margins are going down. That's why management is trying to downplay the impact.So these are some things to think about as you sit on a very pricey stock with slowing growth, increased difficulty accelerating growth and likely margin deterioration."
3443326,89226,2015-08-16T17:19:36-04:00,"GrubHub has been on a significant downtrend, which directly contradicts the extensive growth we've seen in their top and bottom lines.A high P/E, in confluence with global macro trends and many food delivery startups becoming new competition, has caused this company to seem unattractive.A growing, loyal following will help to propel this company even higher as the seasonality of the business kicks in.","Despite a few small uptrends, I've watched GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) fall 27.84% in the last three months. The stock is now trading at all-time lows, but with an unattractive P/E of 65.6, many investors are scared off. GrubHub is the largest internet-based food delivery service and has shown excellent yearly growth since its IPO, but the earnings reports are subject to extremely high expectations Global macro trends aren't helping positive sentiment for the stock, but that's why a better analysis of the company's core operations are needed to show just how well they are doing.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAbove you can see how the Q2 earnings report didn't provide a boost to the stock, despite fantastic results. The company is now trading below its 50 and 200 MDA, making this $28 level a great time to buy in, technically. The high P/E will retreat as the seasonality of the business kicks in and GrubHub sees higher EPS. Also, the forward P/E is 33.74.Q2 Earnings A BeatI saw headlines running a few weeks ago about this company delivering exceptional results for Q2. The headlines weren't wrong - these numbers are incredible. It was a knockout quarter.All of this occurred in one of the quarters that I previously mentioned would not be the greatest environment for them to operate in. Now with that landscape changing going into Q3 and Q4 (i.e. back to school, higher work volumes, poorer weather creating more delivery opportunities), there's no reason that GrubHub can't blow Q3 numbers out of the water. These financials are an excellent fundamental basis to help the company grow. The seasonality of the delivery business will help take GrubHub higher and will solidified in the Q3 earnings report.On another note, as the company continues to integrate its acquisitions, it's going to be able to expand internationally even faster. The potential? Company management identified that unique restaurants (non-chains) are a $221 billion global market, for which Americans comprise $70 billion. With a small market cap of just over $2.4 billion, GrubHub certainly has the fiscal playing field to run. Capturing even 1% of the American market would allow for GrubHub to see a 33% increase in their market cap.Uber and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) are two companies that are both creating food delivery services and while it's pretty obvious that they both have the basis to create an excellent platform, their execution is entirely different.With an Uber IPO continually being pushed back and Yelp down 66.9% on the year, both of these companies have seen their fair share of troubles, with the latter's being user growth. Uber has created UberEats, which is moderately priced, but is very selective. The company gives a pre-fixed menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items, available only at those times, and you may not get what you want. If you want the deli down the street, UberEats doesn't have it.Yelp! on the other hand, has created Eat24, a food delivery service that is identical to GrubHub's in looks, right down to the red banner coloring. It's not identical in the sense that it hasn't experienced nearly the same earnings growth as GrubHub, despite being around since 2008. In a response to how Eat24 has affected the company, management stated, ""So, to the whole concept I'd say no ones doing what we're doing at our scale. "" That's right on the spot as they're connected with 6 million unique eateries and no startup or current platform has even come close to that.While other food delivery startups like Munchery or Freshly have received an excess in VC funding this year to the total tune of $500 million, these companies are too niche in focus, do not have a loyal and growing consumer base, and do not have as wide of a geographic reach as GrubHub, making their value-added component significantly less. You can even read about to the failure of one company, Chefly, here and learn that too many niche competitors are trying to overextend themselves. These types of companies have a few hundred orders a day. GrubHub averaged 220,000 in Q2.Assuredly, we can't knock the fact that there is growing competitor; however, with GrubHub's aggressive acquisition history from the last four years, taking down Seamless, AllMenus, DiningIn, MenuPages and Restaurants on the Run, this company has built a stronger platform with an even larger consumer base. There's no reason that GrubHub can't take down a company like BlueApron, who's only value-added component is that ""they're healthier"" (you can choose to order healthy food on GrubHub, too).ConclusionIf you're betting against GrubHub, and many are at a 13.9% short interest, you're betting against a top management team that is focused on long-term growth, that knows how to beat competition, and knows how to expand in less than favorable market conditions. As a result, the company operates now in 900 cities in partnership with 35,000 restaurants. It's largest competitor Seamless is now its largest revenue driver. In a company that has only seen top and bottom line growth over the last two years, I refuse to bet against the positives. Furthermore, former CEO Zabusky is now out, and while he took $2.85 million from selling shares, company insiders have not been selling off. I personally advocate for a buy rating."
3354915,73185,2015-07-24T11:08:30-04:00,"GRUB is set to announce Q2 FY15 results on Tuesday, July 28, before the open.The Street is looking for EPS of $0.13 on revenues of $85.32 million.We believe that the company is well positioned in a largely growing market, which will aid top-line growth.","Food delivery platform leader GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is set to announce Q2 FY15 results on Tuesday, July 28, before the open. The Street is looking for EPS of $0.13 on revenues of $85.32 million. We have GRUB modeled to beat top-line and miss bottom-line estimates.GRUB Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsSince its IPO in April FY14, the company has proven its ability to consistently grow top line; however, concerns over the general food delivery market persist and are reflected in the current stock price. We do not expect this to change, as the market is still in its early stages, but has high-growth opportunities.Q1 FY15 results beat revenue and missed EPS estimates. GRUB also saw its active users increase 45.4% YoY to 5.6 million and Daily Average Grubs increase 29.7% YoY to 235,000. This strong growth is attributable to positive seasonal tailwinds and a fuller school calendar. We do not expect the weather tailwinds to aid revenue growth much in Q2, but believe the GRUB brand presence will aid revenues. Recent hire of Barbara Coppola (ex-Head of Marketing at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Express and ex-Head of Product Marketing for YouTube, Google Chromecast, and Google TV) should translate to an increase in brand awareness in major cities where GRUB operates, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Dallas, and Miami. We believe that the efforts of Barbara Coppola will translate directly into sales growth.Management reiterates that TAM (Total Addressable Market) is $70 billion, and GRUB is the market leader in that simplified, online food delivery platform sphere. We believe that investor uncertainty will persist until the market is further proven on a larger scale. We do feel, though, that the market for quick food delivery is growing quickly. The company is well positioned to grow with the market, as evidenced by its ability to grow revenues, penetrate new regions of the market, complete strategic acquisitions, and build a top-notch management team.Our Daily Average Grubs analysis calls for a revenue beat when the company reports next week. Daily Average Grubs grew to 234,700 last quarter, and the trend on 2014 and 2013 data is that Daily Average Grubs are relatively constant from Q1 to Q2. We conservatively model for Daily Average Grubs to fall sequentially to 230,000.Gross Food Sales grew to $589.9 million in Q1, up from $433 million in Q1 of 2014. This implies that average sales per grub in Q1 grew from $26.55 in 2014 to $27.93 in 2015. Again, 2013 and 2014 trends indicate that average sales per grub grow marginally from Q1 to Q2. We conservatively model for average sales per grub to be flat sequentially in Q2.These two conservative assumptions lead to a Gross Food Sales estimate of $584.51 million for the quarter. GRUB's revenue is a commission on these Gross Food Sales. Its commissions, as a percent of Gross Food Sales, have grown both YoY and sequentially since 2013 to 14.96% in Q1 2015. All signs point to that commission fee growing in Q2 2015; however, we conservatively model for this commission fee to be flat sequentially.These three conservative assumptions lead to a net revenue estimate for the quarter of $87.44 million versus analyst estimates of $85.32 million. Given our conservative inputs, we have a strong conviction that the company will beat revenues this quarter. We believe the beat could be even larger, driven by increases in personal income and outlays as well as greater brand presence, as discussed earlier. Important to note, we verified day count per quarter using this website."
3440486,40691,2015-08-14T11:03:36-04:00,GrubHub leads the online ordering industry.Online ordering could grow to a $27 billion per year industry by 2025.GrubHub shares are down 40% since April's highs.,"I'm a very big picture guy. I enjoy researching and owning companies that I use on a daily basis.I've been an avid GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) user for the last few years. Earlier this year, I purchased my first position in GrubHub at $38 per share. I really like the GrubHub product, story and the future potential of the industry. However, in April shares of the company quickly rose I sold my shares at about $45 per share. Frankly, I wasn't expecting a quick return. Since then, I've been waiting for the right opportunity to rebuild my long position in GrubHub.Since topping out around $48 per share, shares of GrubHub have plummeted. Shares are now trading at $29, down about 40% from the highs. A series of negative analyst notes, fears of increasing competition, and fears of a technology bubble have placed pressure on shares. Despite the recent drop in GrubHub, my thesis and long-term outlook remained whole. I'm looking to rebuild my position in GrubHub at these levels, and I believe you should consider doing so too.What is GrubHub?Where have you been? Just kidding. GrubHub is a very popular online food ordering company. As described by the company, ""GrubHub is the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering company dedicated to connecting hungry diners with local takeout restaurants."" Being a current college student, I've gotten to know GrubHub all too well over the last few years. And I'm not alone.GrubHub's online and mobile ordering platform allows users to order online from approximately 35,000 takeout restaurants in more than 900 U.S. cities and London. Whether you know what you want, or are unsure, GrubHub makes it easy to find, order and pay for food.Source: GrubHubVirtually every restaurant in my area now supports GrubHub. To get started, you first need to set up a GrubHub account. You can create an account with just an email and password. After that, you can link your credit card. After that, you can save predefined addresses into your GrubHub account.For example, you can save ""home"" or ""work"" or ""girlfriend's house"" as a pre-entered delivery locations. In just a few minutes you are ready and all set up for convenient 1:00 a.m. post-bar ordering. GrubHub excels with usability and customer support. The company really makes it easy. Plus, the customer support is awesome. One day I accidentally ordered from a restaurant that had been recently closed. After about 30 minutes of waiting for my order, I chatted online with a GrubHub representative. Within two minutes I had a full refund, and a nice coupon to make up for the mistake.Not only is GrubHub great for the consumer, but GrubHub is excellent for the restaurants who support GrubHub. GrubHub recently commissioned a study to help understand the economic impact that GrubHub has on participating restaurants.""According to the study, restaurants that join GrubHub increase their takeout revenue by an average of 25% in the first year. In fact after joining GrubHub one in five restaurants more than doubled their takeout business. What's even more compelling is that compared to other online ordering platforms, GrubHub provides 5x more takeout revenue lift.""GrubHub is winning the online ordering war through its excellent product, support and growth for its restaurant partners. And more importantly, they've built a powerful two-sided market.Industry OpportunityI'm very bullish on the online food ordering and delivery industry. People are always going to be hungry. People are always going to order out. Virtually everyone has access to the internet, and 71% of the U.S. adult population has a smartphone.According to Citi Research analyst Mark May, the online takeout and delivery industry is currently worth an astounding $70 billion. When you consider that just 4% of takeout and delivery is transacted online, there's plenty of room to grow for GrubHub. Moreover, May also expects that the entire takeout and delivery industry will continue to grow by 25% by 2025.There has been pushback from the market in terms of valuation. Across the technology sector we've seen fears of another dot com technology bubble. But in my opinion GrubHub's pitch deck still makes sense. Investors are investing in a high growth company, not a blue chip stock. GrubHub is the leader in market share in a growing $70 billion industry, yet the company has just a $2.42 billion valuation. I expect the online food ordering industry to grow to the market penetration of the online hotel and flight reservation industry.Seeking Alpha Contributor L&F Capital Management did an excellent job summarizing the financial opportunity for GrubHub in the decade to come. In summary, the restaurant ordering and delivery market is expected to hit $90 billion by 2025. Assuming online hotel and airline transactions as a baseline of market penetration, 30%, it is reasonable to predict that $27 billion of the $90 billion ordering and delivery market will be conducted online. Then, assuming GrubHub keeps its 11% revenue market share, we can expect the company to be generating about $3 billion in revenue per year by 2025.However, I don't believe that GrubHub will maintain its 11% market share. I believe GrubHub will work to expand its market share as more restaurants and consumers learn to love the product. GrubHub is the best investment vehicle to play a growing restaurant ordering market and a higher penetration of online ordering. GrubHub has built an extensive two-sided network which is going to be tough to challenge.Solid Q2 ResultsWhen GrubHub reported its second quarter results last month, shares got a nice bump higher, trading up to $36. The street had been expecting revenues of $85.3 million in the second quarter, but GrubHub beat expectations with $88 million on the topline. Year-over-year, GrubHub has managed to grow its second quarter revenue by an incredible 47%. And on the bottom line, GrubHub saw a 68% jump in adjusted EBITDA with $28.4 million.Moreover, GrubHub was positive on guidance for 2015. GrubHub predicts fiscal 2015 revenues in the range of $358 to $364 million, up slightly from previous guidance of $346 to $361 million. On the bottom line, GrubHub predicts fiscal 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $104 million to $112 million, up from previous guidance of $101 to $109 million.Acquisition Target?Buying a stock solely on the hopes of a future acquisition is never a great idea. Even without the potential of an acquisition, I still like GrubHub. That being said, GrubHub could be an excellent addition to a larger brand looking for exposure in online ordering.Everyone from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) could be interested in acquiring the dominant force in online ordering. Online ordering would fit well with online travel booking, online shopping and even online reviews. GrubHub could be a neat acquisition for a number of large technology companies. Especially considering the fact that shares are down over 25% over the last year. Remember Priceline's acquisition of OpenTable? Well shares of OpenTable had been down by 16% in the three months leading up to the deal.I don't want to spend too much time on this section. I just wanted to throw this idea out there.ConclusionI like the opportunity and growth to be had in the online food ordering industry. GrubHub presents the best investment vehicle to take advantage of this emerging industry and concept. A great product combined with a solidified two sided network makes GrubHub the market leader. If you've been looking to start a position in the company, this summer's selloff presents an attractive opportunity. I plan on restarting my position in GrubHub shortly. I plan on taking it slow, buying in intervals. The last thing we want to do is to try and catch a falling knife so to speak. I'm also looking at the MAR-16 $30 call currently priced at $3.70 as a way to take advantage of a recovery during the remainder of the year. By selling the MAR-16 $45 call, you could bring your total cost down to $3.00."
3279215,22148,2015-06-24T18:18:03-04:00,GrubHub trades close to all-time lows.The online takeout ordering and delivery service faces a competitive environment while at the same executives are cashing in stock options and dumping shares.The stock will eventually reward investors though the timing is a major concern in the short term.,"GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) traded down to post-IPO lows on the heels of executives unloading shares. The online takeout ordering service is uniquely profitable for an early stage Internet marketplace, yet the stock isn't catching on with investors.The IPO priced at $26 and GrubHub initially traded up to $40 on the first day of trading over a year ago. The stock now trades at $35 after a year of successfully growing the business.Does the stock collapse provide an opportunity or is too much competition clicking on the heels of the online food ordering service?Insider SalesGrubHub has been in a major downtrend ever since the Q1 earnings report. The market sold off the stock partially due to the mindset that the company missed estimates. In GrubHub Investors Misunderstood Q1 Numbers, we made the attempt to rectify the confusion. Unfortunately though, the damage was done and momentum was lost.It doesn't help that executives are unloading shares. The CEO recently sold 11K shares and a few stock options. At the same time, the president has steadily unloaded shares acquired apparently via stock options. While the dumped options aren't overly alarming, the fact that Zabusky only owns 53,255 shares directly is concerning for an executive that should have a view of the stock reaching milestone valuations such as $10 billion or even $20 billion. So far, he appears very content in unloading stock at prices placing the valuation closer to $3 billion.CompetitionDo a quick news search on Google and one will see an unlimited string of competitors obtaining funding for the online ordering or takeout market segment. The businesses are sprouting up to take advantage of the booming demand for online food ordering and delivery. In fact, business is so good that some restaurants are choosing to work with GrubHub competitors so that it won't see a flood of orders.Below is a quick review of the recent fundings in this sector:The numbers above are only a sampling of the fundraising reported in the last week or so. CB Insights estimated that food tech companies raised $1 billion in funding last year alone. The research firm provided the following graphic highlighting the fight for market positions in the food tech sector.A major problem with the profits produced by GrubHub is that it attracts all of the above competitors. New players such as ChowNow can take advantage of having a smaller brand that won't swamp kitchens or competitors that can undercut GrubHub on commissions.While some of these scenarios are natural outcomes of a successful business, it doesn't help the stock in the short run.TakeawayBased on the profits already generated by GrubHub, the dominant player in the online food ordering and delivery sector will likely reward shareholders. With the first-mover advantage, scale and public market status, GrubHub already has the brand to produce that dominant marketplace. In the meantime, the stock isn't going to perform due to competition. Investors can quickly review the 3D printing and organic grocers stocks to see what happens in that scenario.Eventually GrubHub will reward investors, but the competitive nature of the sector will make it difficult for that to occur now."
3361395,73185,2015-07-27T17:08:18-04:00,"GRUB was downgraded by analysts at Cowen who expressed concerns over the competitive landscape inherent to the online food delivery takeaway industry.Right now, we figure the stock is priced to reap about 9% of future market share, and we believe that is too low for this industry leader.Given current trends, we qualitatively feel that GRUB is poised to at least retain its 10% revenue market share, and very likely grow it.Even in the face of significant competition, the untapped market is large enough for GRUB to experience strong earnings growth concurrent with competitors growing healthily as well.We believe shares are worth north of their current market value, and also affirm this sell-off gives investors favorable asymmetry heading into what we believe will be a strong quarter.","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) was downgraded by analysts at Cowen who expressed concerns over the competitive landscape inherent to the online food delivery takeaway industry. The stock is down 10% in response to that downgrade. While the industry does have low barriers to entry and is subject to intense competition as Cowen pointed out, the industry also is poised for significant growth. Right now, we figure the stock is priced to reap about 9% of future market share (explained in-depth below), and we believe that is too low for this industry leader. Considering we expect the company to deliver a strong quarter this week, we are buyers today on the dip as it falls below what we consider to be the low-end of our fair value of $33 per share.We believe the online independent restaurant delivery and pick-up industry will blossom over the next 10 years. Last year, 4% of the independent restaurant delivery and pick-up industry's $70 billion transactions were online. We believe that fraction will reasonably grow to 30% by 2025, as convenience and online engagement become more and more important to consumers. Such a growth also would mirror the rise of online hotel and airline transactions.The delivery takeaway market in the US is expected to grow at a 3.22% CAGR into 2019, and we are modeling for a 2.33% CAGR into 2025, representing slowed but consistent with steady GDP growth. At this rate, we project the delivery takeaway market to grow to $90 billion in 11 years, and believe that 30%, or $27 billion, of that market will be online. This growth from $2 billion to $27 billion over 11 years represents a CAGR of 34%, and implies huge growth potential for companies in this space.The upside for GRUB, however, will come from the company's ability to capture and retain market share, which were the exact concerns voiced by analysts at Cowen. According to a Citi note, the online transaction industry had revenues of $2.8 billion (4% of $70 billion). GRUB had revenues of $298 million that year, meaning GRUB had roughly an 11% revenue market share. If GRUB can retain 10% revenue market share as the market grows, that's $2.1 billion in revenue by 2025. An 11% net profit margin implies net income of $231 million and, assuming share count grows only marginally to 85 million, equates to EPS of $3.50. Using analyst EPS estimates for 2016 and 2017, and then using a linear growth from 2017 to 2025, our DCF model arrives at a fair value of $33 per share if GRUB can retain 10% market share. We use a fairly conservative 2% perpetuity rate and 8.52% CAPM discount rate.Changing market share to 20% implies 2025 EPS of $7.01 and a fair value of $57.A market share of 30% implies 2025 EPS of $10.50 and a fair value of $80.Right now, we can see the market is currently valuing GRUB's potential revenue market share at around 9%. We admit this seems fair given low barriers to entry, intense competition from multiple entities, and the industry's reliance on disposable income.We, however, believe this outlook is bearish. Given current trends, we qualitatively feel that GRUB is poised to at least retain its 10% revenue market share, and very likely grow it. We believe this will be driven by scalability, consolidation and certain price-point advantages.The internet-dominated world is one catered to convenience and consolidation, and we believe GRUB is poised to capitalize on both of these demands as the online ordering industry grows. GRUB offers a centralized system for smaller players to get online traffic and as the user base grows, we believe many larger players that offer their own online delivery services, like Domino's (NYSE:DPZ), will realize the benefits of being featured on a consolidated, centralized system which receives more traffic than an individual application. Despite GRUB's early-start advantage at providing this consolidated database, we acknowledge that GRUB is subject to intense competition from similar services such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP).GRUB plans to offer delivery services at a 14% margin, the same margin it currently charges restaurants for its ordering platform. Many existing services, though, charge 20% to 30% for such services. Moreover, GRUB is committed to keeping fees down to a nominal rate that is necessary to break-even.We believe these advantages imply that some consolidated online order system is poised for huge upside, and further believe GRUB is the front-runner to be that consolidated online order system.This huge sell-off heading into earnings on an analyst downgrade due to the competitive landscape seems over-done. We believe the speculative nature of the report does not warrant a 10% loss in market-cap for a stock which seems poised to grow earnings significantly. Even in the face of significant competition, the untapped market is large enough for GRUB to experience strong earnings growth concurrent with competitors' growth. We believe shares are worth north of their current market value, and also affirm this sell-off gives investors favorable asymmetry heading into what we believe will be a strong quarter."
3278455,21791,2015-06-23T13:58:40-04:00,Where and how we get food outside the home is undergoing a significant change creating opportunities for investment.Cultural changes in the American landscape are pointing to a future of growth for GrubHub as more and more Americans are choosing to make purchases online.The company seems to be doing everything right so far in my judgment.,"Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), wrote in his book ""Only the paranoid Survive"":There are changes happening in both where and how we get our food outside the home. Investors can participate in these changes by considering purchasing shares of GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) as the share price has pulled back in price.GrubHub is an online food ordering platform for pick-up and delivery at restaurants. It was founded in 2004 and went public in April of 2014 at $26 a share.I wrote about GrubHub in May of last year when the share price was $33 and suggested that shares could decline to $20 based on a number of reasons I spelled out.I've been paying close attention to the company since then and have seen all my concerns for that pullback going away and instead I have become more optimistic.My first concern was that GrubHub's business model could be easily replicated and faced potentially fierce competition. Competition from local mom and pop type operations that provided the service of both online ordering and provided the delivery drivers to pick up and deliver the meals. GrubHub at the time did not provide delivery drivers at any of the restaurants it is affiliated with, only the online ordering platform. The restaurant would have to have its own delivery driver to deliver the food ordered on its platform.Meanwhile, other online ordering platforms also provided the drivers.I live just outside of Ithaca, NY, and in Ithaca, we have Ithaca To Go. It's an online food ordering platform that also provides the drivers for delivery.Ithaca To Go gets somewhere around 25% of the food order as its fee from the restaurant and the drivers get a delivery fee + the tip as its payment. GrubHub on the other hand gets around 14% of the food order but doesn't provide the delivery driver.I am friends with a family that owns a restaurant near Cornell University in Ithaca. They were in need of drivers so I offered to help out this past school year. It was this experience that gave me an inside look at how food delivery works. On an average day, there could be about 60 delivery orders at this restaurant. GrubHub would get the majority of them, about 30-40. Ithaca To Go would see 15-25 and the remaining 5-10 would be orders that came in over the phone. As for the pick up orders, GrubHub would also generate at least half of the total orders while the other half were called in or ordered on site in person.What I noticed was that for this demographic of mostly college students, online ordering was the norm. Even older local residents were just as tech savvy as they too ordered via GrubHub majority of the time.In essence, 80-90% of all delivery order were placed online at this restaurant. About 50% of pick-up orders where done over GrubHub as well. Pick up or delivery, the company gets its 14% of the food order.The situation for GrubHub was, Ithaca To Go was taking a good 30%-40% of the online food orders and that placed great competition for GrubHub's market share.Not having drivers put GrubHub at a disadvantage I thought as restaurants would be more willing to add other online ordering platforms if it also provided drivers for delivery.Then in February of this year, GrubHub announced it planned to have its own fleet of delivery drivers. It began by purchasing 2 companies, DiningIn and Restaurants On The Go which put the company in 12 metro markets servicing some 3,000 restaurants.The best part was that because of GrubHub's economies of scale, it would be able to offer its typical 14% fee while still providing the drivers for delivery vs. what appears to be the norm of 20%-30% that online food ordering platforms charge that also provide delivery.That could substantially help the company achieve a greater share of the total online food orders as restaurants choose to solely work with GrubHub.That is no longer a concern of mine as GrubHub is positioning itself to be both the go to and sole platform for restaurants for online ordering with the option of delivery too.My other concerns back in May of 2014 were insiders selling once the lock up date expired later in the year. This was also based on my fear of overvaluation of the share price based on 20% annual growth over the following 5 years.Because growth has far exceeded 20% and although there has been some insider selling, which should be expected, both of those concerns have been alleviated. In the first quarter of 2015, average daily GrubHub orders were up 30% while revenue was up 51% from the year-ago period.Future Growth For GrubHub and Reasons To Be OptimisticA new thought I had a few months ago while I did this brief food delivery stint was the idea that there are small places that could be rented and food prepared for delivery and pick up only without the need for a large dine-in space. With the business model moving more and more toward the online ordering platform and also providing the drivers, all one needs is a kitchen, cook, cashier and some food permits, and they could be in business.Just have a listing on GrubHub and orders will come as the listing itself makes for a great advertisement.Sure enough, that is the plan for even more future growth!CEO and co-founder Matt Maloney put it like this in an interview with the Wall Street Journal back in May:Here's what I think:Non-restaurant kitchens could prove to be a new micro food industry and GrubHub will be the toll collector. Currently, kitchen-only restaurants comprise low-single-digit market share of total orders placed on GrubHub, but is expected to grow exponentially according to Matt Maloney in the same Wall Street Journal interview.At 35.00 a share, the market cap of GrubHub is about $2.95 billion. Sales are expected to be around $360 million in fiscal 2015 and $460 in 2016. These estimates are reasonable and may prove to be exceeded based on all the exciting growth prospects the company is putting forward.These are the winds of change I see at hand.More and more Americans will be using their smart phone and tablets when ordering food for pick up or delivery. When Americans take road trips, rather than stopping at the sight of the super high McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) golden arches sign, they'll be entering the next zip code on GrubHub's website with their smart phones looking to see where they can pre-order their next meal for a quick and easy pick up.The adaptation of online ordering continues to surge and it's impacting how we get our food outside the home now more than ever.E-Commerce remains in high growth mode and just hit 7% of total retail sales in the first quarter of 2015.Good cooks with commercial kitchens will be in high demand in every city and town throughout America, but they will have to be connected to online ordering platforms like GrubHub if they want to increase their chances of success. It's good to see the company understanding this area of growth and concentrating on it.This business model of online food ordering is really like that of a toll collector and that's what makes this model so sound. So long that the company's online ordering platform becomes the road of choice for both the restaurant and the customer, investors are in for a long ride.Looking out 5-10 years is how investors should perceive a GRUB investment. Dollar cost averaging purchases also makes sense with this stock as well as its value has the potential to range dramatically given its wide forecasts for growth.I will continue to check in with this restaurant here in Ithaca on how GrubHub is doing, how its market share is holding up, and if it is facing any other online ordering competition to help keep in me in the trenches."
3270385,89226,2015-06-19T10:54:47-04:00,"The Relative Strength Index is proving to be a key indicator for solid entry points into GrubHub’s stock.President Jonathan Zabusky is leaving the company. His departure was marked by a large amount of shares being sold off.GrubHub is a unique industry leader that's aggressively pursuing acquisitions, unified integration across their platforms and sees long-term expansion as inevitable.","I'm part of the class of investors that's still skeptical about the long-term viability of internet companies thanks to March 2001. One internet company, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which has a well-known online and app-based platform for food delivery service, has seen a recent down trend since late April in their share price. A daunting P/E, the lack of a dividend, and high insider activity all reinforce this decline. However, I believe the stock has room to run based upon a few key indicators like the RSI, industry consolidation and expansion potential.Initial Attraction for Buying GrubHubGrubHub is a company that's in its relative infancy and is subject to a lot of volatility. I first observed their capital structure and found that they have absolutely no short-term or long-term debt obligations, which is astounding considering most U.S. companies are leveraged, if not heavily leveraged. A key indicator of overselling or buying, the RSI, has little history with GrubHub, but nonetheless, a fruitful history. Take a look at the chart below in relation to their current share price:Source: BloombergThey're slightly in oversold territory which, while not enticing me to throw money at the stock, does seem to present an initial argument as to why I should buy GrubHub sometime this summer. Monitoring this for a few days in advance will give me a better idea of what's happening with the trading.I say this in light of the last two months' worth of company filings. There are over 20 SEC form 144s filed, all indicating the selling of GrubHub shares. Jonathan Zabusky, the company's president, has sold $2.85 million worth of stock in June alone, and a lot of other institutional investors have decided to get out as well. This hefty amount of insider activity has caused the recent drop in share price, but to the point where it is oversold, thus creating an entry point. Why? Take a look at the numbers.We saw good improvement out of GrubHub from FY 2014 to FY 2015 by 76% in terms of EPS - and that's without debt being in the capital structure. Leveraged companies follow the general principle of having a higher EPS. Now, when we take a look at revenue growth for GrubHub, we see that it has increased by nice margins every year and that FY 2015 Q1 revenues of $88.2 million were substantially higher than $58.6 million from the prior year period. While profitability margins were slightly lower last quarter, hefty expenses were seen in advertising due to ""experimentation"" and ""spending more in favorable market conditions to attract new diners and get current diners more orders"" (earnings transcript).Strategic Acquisitions to Cultivate EarningsGrubHub will provide more value to shareholders in the future because of the moves they are making now on the acquisition front. In Q1 2015, they acquired two RDS services, DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run. This now enables them to provide full delivery services, rather than just online coordination, and access a larger network of restaurants than ever before. This will assuredly fare well in the long term. They spent $55.5 million in acquisitions in the last 12 months, but have still managed to maintain a positive FCF of over $72 million.""The real long-term opportunity is partnering with the restaurants in a deep way because the restaurants are willing to pay the transport if they see more sales,"" said CEO Matthew Maloney (earnings transcript). It is through the strategic acquisitions of DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run that they will be able to bolster revenues and create more value for shareholders. Furthermore, the integration with Google will certainly help them gain exposure. Based upon my analysis, I'd say an entry point of somewhere before the Q2 earnings call is a good move for your portfolio.One final note: the big growth catalysts for GrubHub are seasonality and students. The summer months are not going to be as profitable for the winter months as these two factors are diminished to an extent. However, seeing that the stock is currently oversold and understanding that these are two big revenue drivers, coupled with almost a complete integration with their new RDS acquisitions, GrubHub is going to do exceptionally well later this year. That's why it's ample to strike now and not later. Winter is coming and your portfolio better have room for some Grub.Note: All Financial Data Taken From Bloomberg."
3156256,87666,2015-05-07T16:51:49-04:00,GrubHub offers a seamless approach for Facebook to capitalize its large user base.The market size of online food ordering service would explode if introduced to social networking platforms.Absorbing GrubHub diversifies Facebook’s revenue sources while at the same time enhances user experience in the Facebook eco-system.,"Imagine the following scenario: foodies share pictures of delicious meals they ordered on Instagram and when their friends click on the photos, they have the option to place their own order for delivery for the food. The whole scene would be made possible by integrating the GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) dining system with the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) platform. If that happens, all Facebook users on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger would find much more comfortable living in the Facebook eco-system with the value-added service enabled by GrubHub. Yes, the viewpoint of this article is: GrubHub is a good acquisition target for Facebook.In the past two years, Facebook has made clear its determination to exert impact on everyone's social life through acquisitions of popular apps like Instagram and then WhatsApp. GrubHub could be the next one added to that list given the potential huge business and user-experience-enhancing opportunities GrubHub could bring to Facebook.Exhibit 1.GrubHub has grown its user base around 50% year-over-year, almost in the same speed at which Instagram and WhatsApp manage to attract new users. Currently valued at a little more than three times of the money Facebook paid to buy Instagram in 2013 and less than one-fifth of what Facebook paid for WhatsApp in 2014, (See Exhibit 1), GrubHub has already maturated its money-spinning model and is churning out impressive amount of revenue and profits each day by taking commission on every dining order users make through its website/mobile app. This model stands in contrast with how Facebook has delayed heavy monetization through advertising in Instagram and WhatsApp in fear of the side effects of harming user experience. GrubHub offers one natural solution for Facebook to exploit its large user base without bombarding them with advertisements, which takes the risk of displeasing or even turning away current users.Exhibit 2.The online food ordering industry, compared to the internet advertising industry which Facebook sources most of its revenue from, is still in its nascent stage. The current food takeout market in U.S. is estimated to be around $70 Billion a year in sales while the global internet advertising market is at $121 Billion, as estimated by ZenithOptimedia (see Exhibit 2). As the market leader in online food ordering, GrubHub has the highest market share but only generates less than half a billion in revenue a year. Any significant sales transfer from off-line takeout ordering to online ordering could give a huge boost to the online food ordering industry, considering a commission rate of 13.5% GrubHub currently charges per order. The online food ordering industry is much less saturated than the internet advertising industry where dominant players like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have to compete with each other to grab market share.Exhibit 3.GrubHub sees strong growth ahead and is now valued at a reasonable market capitalization level. If we compare financial outcomes between GrubHub and Facebook (see Exhibit 3), GrubHub generated revenue and net income around 1/40 and 1/48 of that of Facebook's, respectively, while its market cap is only 1/65 that of Facebook's. These valuations stand all the while GrubHub expands its user base and grows revenue/income at a much faster pace than Facebook does on its business. One noteworthy aspect of GrubHub is that its small user base is capable of generating the current level of revenue. Say, if Facebook integrates GrubHub as an embedded function to its system, the usage of this dining feature by 0.1% of current Facebook active users could easily increase the number of daily grubs by four times, and, assuming revenue rises proportionally, this dining feature could bring in more than 1/10 of Facebook's current revenue.Facebook would benefit from acquiring GrubHub and integrating the online food ordering service to its platform in the following three ways:All in all, Facebook acquiring GrubHub is a win-win game. Providing online food ordering service would fit the current Facebook eco-system well. GrubHub has the most advanced infrastructure and a well-run management team in the fledgling market to whet appetites of both Facebook and GrubHub investors, and, most importantly, the appetite of the over 1 billion Facebook users."
3135976,48411,2015-05-04T11:57:02-04:00,"GRUB is easily trading at a 25% discount in light of its excellent financials and key metrics reported at Q1 earnings.That stated discount, by the way, is simply where GRUB was trading pre-Q1 earnings selloff.A selloff driven by GRUB's guidance of higher revenue and flat Adjusted EBITDA - an Adjusted EBITDA figure hurt by increased infrastructure investment.However, I feel the investments are going to make GRUB both further offensive and defensive.BUY this dip in GRUB as the shares will trade much higher into year-end.","GrubHub Inc. (NYSE:GRUB) is trading at roughly a 25% discount to fair value in light of their recent selloff post-Q1 earnings. Shares were trading at ~$50 prior to announcing an excellent quarter of growth and further market share capture and now trade at ~$40. In an effort to not be sensational and to give those shorting the stock (~7.2% of the float is short) some credit in that GRUB is investing at an accelerated pace into its infrastructure for the balance of 2015 I won't price in any upticks to pre-Q1 pricing although I definitely feel the Q1 results are deserving of such. I continue to recommend a long position in GRUB.That said, GRUB's quarter was as described - healthy and productive. GRUB reported another quarter of strong key metric and financial growth posting 5.6 million active diners (46% Y/Y increase), ~235,000 daily orders (~30% Y/Y increase), ~$590 million in sales (36% Y/Y increase), and ~$88 million in revenue (51% growth Y/Y, 20% sequential quarter growth from Q4). Really, I don't know from a financial and key metric standpoint what else GRUB could have done to example its execution. To me, Q1 was indicative of GRUB's differentiation and its long-term viability. GRUB is executing its model at a scale that has never been done before and clearly it's doing it at more than acceptable levels of quality. Now, the only financial blemish (if you can call it that) to come from the Q1 investor call was that GRUB guided for was a flat Adjusted EBITDA guidance despite an increases top line expectation. Of course, this means increased expenses/lower Adjusted EBITDA margin. Now, where were these increased expenses coming from? GRUB CFO Adam DeWitt was very clear:That's right. GRUB is going to increase spending directed towards its recent acquisitions (GRUB acquired the largest RDS services in the US - DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run) that by the way have a revenue capture rate roughly double that of its pre-acquisition core business. I think that if the market wants to sell GRUB down on that news, and it has to be on this news because everything else reported came out more than ""just fine"" (and I can't take seriously the idea that the sell down took place as a result of not newsworthy Yelp and Eat24 M&A), that this presents an opportunity to buy this multi-year bull run story at a discount. It should be noted that macro-market, beta driven and/or ""fear"" based selloffs in the past have clearly been buying opportunities. Now, in that same breath I'll concede that anytime a company increases spending it is in fact positioning itself and shareholders for an incrementally higher level of risk. For what if the spending turns out to be ineffective of an outright failure, right? I'll conceded that. But GRUB didn't just jump into its self-delivery driving acquisitions and it hasn't failed to execute just yet. I believe this correction is highly misplaced.Overall when looking at the financials, the key metrics, the massive TAM even in light of ""increased competition"" from a subpar company like Yelp, the growth of the defensiveness created by GRUB's ever-expanding network, GRUB's continued Tier 2 market growth, and GRUB's continued success in becoming a mobile company (53% of orders at quarter-end were placed via mobile) I have zero concerns about GRUB. I anticipate that GRUB finishes the year priced much higher than today and I would even go as far to say much higher than ~$50 share. The current mean price target being reported to Thomson is $50 with the high target being reported at $56 (the low target reported is $44 which is still ~10% higher).I continue to recommend a long position in GRUB. Good luck, everybody."

Yet, insider trades and sluggish earnings should not be the No. 1 concern for people looking at GrubHub.What investors should look at and what many probably miss is a German internet company that just IPO'ed overseas last year called Rocket Internet. You probably have never heard of it so far, but it is the biggest global internet platform outside the US and China. If you want to know more about the company, you should read my instablog post.Rocket owns stakes in several online food delivery companies which together make up the world's largest player in this field. Rocket's ""Global Online Takeaway Group"" (GOTG) comprises its stakes in Delivery Hero (40% owned by Rocket), Foodpanda (52%), Pizzabo.it (100%) and LaNeveraRoja (100%). Together, these companies are the biggest online takeaway group in the world, far larger than GrubHub or Just Eat (OTC:JSTLF). GOTG operates in 71 countries and is the No. 1 player in 59. The countries of operation as well as the market position in each country are shown in the picture below.(Source: Rocket Internet 2014 Results Presentation)Note here that Rocket contributed its stakes in e-Food, Yemeksepeti and Talabat.com to increase its stake in Delivery Hero from 30% to 40%. They are all now 100% owned by Delivery Hero.GrubHub Has A Growth ProblemThe strengths of Rocket's GOTG highlight where GrubHub's weaknesses are. GOTG easily overtakes GrubHub and Just Eat in terms of orders and the number of takeaway restaurants. It also operates in more favorable markets. GOTG is big in fast-growing emerging markets such as China, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Turkey, Nigeria, etc. These countries are characterized by a large and young population but low Internet penetration. Its geographical exposure to emerging markets gives GOTG attractive long-term growth prospects.(Source: Rocket Internet 2014 Results Presentation)You might not be aware of it yet, but GrubHub's problem is growth. It operates only in the US and London, UK, where the market is already dominated by Just Eat (No. 1) and Delivery Hero (No. 2). GrubHub is currently trading at a 10x sales multiple and a 96x PE multiple, which implies investors are discounting earnings at only a bit more than 1%. To justify such high multiples, GrubHub has to grow fast. The problem is where this growth will come from.Growth can come from the following sources:GrubHub's growth right now comes mainly from higher market penetration. GrubHub estimates that online takeaway orders just represent 5% of the total delivery market. We can now do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to see when the market will be saturated. First of all, a certain percentage of that market will always remain offline because of convenience, sub-100% internet penetration and low penetration of rural areas. Let us assume 20% of the food delivery market will remain offline and inaccessible for GrubHub. GrubHub is currently growing at a 50% rate and as the No. 1 player in the US, we can assume that market penetration of online takeaway orders grows at the same pace. If growth continues at the same pace, GrubHub's market will be saturated just within seven years.(Source: GrubHub June 2014 Investor Presentation)Once its home market is saturated, GrubHub has to grow through margin expansion or acquisitions. Given it operates only in the US and the UK, GDP growth will not be a big growth driver. Its move to London also was not the best idea. Just Eat is the No. 1 player in the UK and Delivery Hero is No. 2. Once the market saturates and consolidates, most markets will likely be dominated by either 1 or 2 big players, leaving GrubHub only with the US as a profitable market.On the contrary, Rocket's GOTG is well-positioned in emerging markets. The growth opportunities just from higher market penetration are huge. Given the low internet penetration and high population in the countries it operates in, a 1% increase in Internet penetration means 54m additional potential customers. It will probably take decades until GOTG's market is saturated while GrubHub's market could be saturated within seven years already.This leaves GrubHub with the option to grow through acquisitions, and the company is already pursuing this opportunity. The problem is that GOTG already is the No. 1 player in the most attractive markets. So the possibilities to grow by geographical diversification are very limited.GOTG Ready To IPOGrubHub and Just Eat both went public last year and the CEO of Delivery Hero, the largest company within Rocket's GOTG, has already stated that they are also eyeing an IPO even though he said it will not happen this year. In case of an IPO, I believe that Rocket will contribute its stakes in Foodpanda, LaNeveraRoja and Pizzabo.it in exchange for a higher share in Delivery Hero as they did before with Yemeksepeti and Talabat.com. This would create the biggest player in the online food delivery market. I believe that an IPO will get a lot of attention because of the size of the company as well its superior long-term growth prospects.I'm especially worried by the lack of growth opportunities for GrubHub in the long term. Of course, seven years of 50% growth would be very impressive, but even at this level, GrubHub seems decently valued. Taking last year's EPS of $0.3 and assuming EPS growth of 50% for the next seven years would yield EPS of $5.13 by the end of 2021. If we discount this number at a reasonable 10% per year gives us a present value of $2.63. At the current stock price of $35, this eventually leads to an implied P/E multiple of 13.3x, which is not cheap at all.Of course, it could very well be the case that GrubHub grows faster or slower over the next years. Seven years is a very long time horizon to consider for such a young company and is connected with a lot of uncertainty. The calculations presented are just made for seven years, but I see a lot of risk in the years beyond. If you want to justify GrubHub's high trading multiples, you have to look at a very long time horizon that expands beyond 2021. I think that most investors are not aware of the lack of long-term growth opportunities because they are not aware of Rocket Internet's strong position in the online delivery market."
2915266,55442,2015-02-14T07:21:19-05:00,"Yelp recently acquired Eat24, a leading food delivery website. This indicates that Yelp is serious about competing with GrubHub.After acquiring OpenTable last year, I expect Priceline to become a more aggressive competitor going forward.Trading at 48x 2015 adjusted EPS, investors seem to believe the competitive environment will remain benign.Should competition intensify, the author sees over 40% downside in GrubHub shares.","Earlier this week, it was announced that Yelp (NYSE:YELP) would acquire food delivery website Eat24 for $124 million. Marrying Eat24's platform to Yelp's massive 150 million user audience creates a formidable competitor to GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which currently occupies a leading position in the online ordering segment. While Wall Street has crowned GrubHub to be the winner in online ordering, the relative newness of the industry indicates that we are still in the early innings of what is sure to become an increasingly crowded industry. I expect that competition will continue to increase in this segment putting pressure on revenue growth and operating margins. At 48x 2015 estimated EPS, GrubHub investors are anticipating rapid growth and robust margins. However, as the competitive landscape shifts, I believe the company is poised to disappoint. Should revenue growth slow and margins contract, I believe shares could trade down to $22 (-43% versus today's price).GrubHub has created a highly profitable business model. By providing a platform (website & app) for restaurants to reach hungry consumers (customers that the restaurant would otherwise not reach) seeking takeout or delivery, it is able to charge a fee equal to ~15% of the total order value. Thus far, GrubHub has been a strong success as it has grown users (+47% in 2014) and meals ordered (+35%) and food sold via GrubHub (+39%). Revenue grew a whopping +50% in 2014. It is worth noting that GrubHub's revenue meaningfully outgrew food sales in 2014 as it increased its take rate (percentage of order value kept by GrubHub) on the acquired Seamless business. This was a one-off increase - barring another large acquisition, GrubHub will not have a material increase in its take rate. Thus going forward, GrubHub's revenue will more closely track food sales. I assume that GrubHub will grow more slowly in 2015 than it did in 2014 (as GrubHub grows it becomes more difficult to grow at a high rate). In a static environment, I would anticipate GrubHub will grow food sold at a low to mid 30s rate - however, as new competitors continue to encroach on the space, it is possible that revenue will grow at a slower pace.Last year, Priceline (PCLN) acquired online restaurant reservation leader OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) for $2.6 billion. While OpenTable is currently focused on making reservations for patrons seeking a table, it seems a very natural extension of the business (the sunk cost is the marketing spend required to develop a relationship with the restaurant) to secure orders for takeout. Looking out a year or two, I expect that Uber could become a competitor to GrubHub (initially in delivery but eventually in takeout). While Uber lacks the relationship with restaurants, it could create one by purchasing a small player like delivery.com. Coupled with its network of drivers (and having customers' credit card info and addresses), it could quickly become a formidable competitor. Coupled with Yelp's acquisition of Eat24, I expect the following impact on GrubHub: 1) increased advertising spend required to attract diners (2) reduced traffic flowing to GrubHub resulting in lower food sales (on which GrubHub currently takes nearly 15%) and (3) the potential for reduced take-rates as GrubHub seeks to maintain its competitive position. What might 2015 look like under these conditions? I examine this below.I assume that in a more competitive environment, GrubHub is still able to grow total food sold 32% (vs. 39% reported last year). This is roughly 5% below management forecast (which occurred prior to Yelp's deal to buy Eat24). I assume that GrubHub is able to maintain its take rate at 14.5%. While GrubHub only spent 26% of revenue on sales and marketing last year, I assume that it increases its spend 50% (to 30% of revenue) as it seeks to maintain its leadership position in the face of competition. Other expenses are assumed to grow at 27%. This gets me to $51 million in operating profit. After taxing, I add back non-cash amortization charges. The bulk of this charge was created by the merger with Seemless. I assume that GrubHub continues to maintain a premium valuation (as it will likely still grow faster than the average company). I've used a 28x P/E multiple in the valuation. After adding in net cash, I arrive at a fair value of less than $22 per share, 43% below today's price. Note that if GrubHub is required to reduce its take rate, shares could be worth less than $18.Risks to Thesis"
3136666,22148,2015-05-05T14:13:13-04:00,GrubHub reported mixed Q1'15 results per most media outlets.The online takeout food ordering service smashed adjusted EBITDA estimates.The huge market potential makes GrubHub an interesting stock after the recent selloff.,"The interesting and surprising story regarding GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is that it has turned the online takeout food ordering service into a very profitable business. Typically, online marketplaces spend so heavily to establish a network and grow the customer base that profits are non-existent.In the case of GrubHub, the company appears to only control a small piece of the potential market with 5.6 million active diners during Q1. The marketplace though is already extremely profitable based on solid commissions generated by each order and controlled marketing expenses. Investors didn't appear to like the Q1 report, but did the market misunderstand the numbers?Focus On The Right Q1 NumbersGrubHub fell sharply from $47 to $40 following the reported Q1 earnings miss. The odd part about the supposed EPS miss is that the online takeout marketplace actually easily surpassed the adjusted EBITDA estimates. It is rather impossible and uncommon to miss one and exceed the other.For the quarter, GrubHub reported adjusted EBITDA of $28.3 million, up 72% YoY. The company had only guided towards a mid-point of $25.0 million and analysts pegged the number at $25.9 million. A quick review of the Q1 EBITDA reconciliation highlights the likely culprits.Source: GrubHub Q1 earnings releaseVery quickly the stock-based compensation, amortization, and restructuring charges stand out as not-excluded from the Q1 EPS numbers issued by GrubHub. Per the cash flow statement, the depreciation charges were only $1.2 million while the intangible asset amortization charges were $5.0 million. Combined with the stock-based compensation charges, GrubHub reported $0.12 of earnings that included roughly $8.0 million of non-cash charges normally excluded by other technology and marketplace firms.Regardless of the apparent confusion, investors can use the EBITDA numbers knowing they include very limited ""real costs"" like depreciation and interest expenses. For Q1, GrubHub reported EBITDA of $28.3 million and increased the full-year guidance to a mid-point of $105 million. The stock trades at about 32x the EBITDA estimate with the number forecast to grow roughly 35% over last year. A stock is typically attractively priced when trading at a multiple below the growth rate.Market PotentialWhile this slide is slightly outdated as GrubHub mentioned the U.S. takeout market is over $70 billion now, it does highlight the growth potential for a marketplace that is already extremely profitable.Source: GrubHub presentationThe market remains highly fragmented as GrubHub doesn't even offer services in my market. Not to mention, the complexity and frustrations over paper menus and phone orders is likely to produce overall growth in the market with a seamless online ordering marketplace.The recent delivery acquisitions could substantially expand the addressable market if GrubHub can efficiently figure out how to deliver food from independent restaurants in a similar method that already exists with pizza.TakeawayThe recent drop in GrubHub provides an opportunity as the online takeout ordering service produces strong growth and profits. While it can be difficult to understand the market at times, it is very clear that this company delivered excellent results. Investors need to focus on the strong EBITDA growth and ignore whether GrubHub beat EPS estimates or not. The stock appears reasonably priced at current levels with decent upside potential if it can maintain margins while growing the customer base."
2893786,25120,2015-02-07T13:12:33-05:00,"GrubHub ends 2014 on a strong note and is upbeat about 2015.The company announced two small acquisitions as well, executed at very nice multiples.The aggressiveness to grow the business is important, as the ""winner tends to take it all"" in technology-related industries.Given the relative modest market capitalization, the huge opportunity, profitability, strong growth and great prospects a small speculative long-term position seems warranted.","Investors in GrubHub (GRUB) are very enthusiastic about the fourth quarter results and two bolt-on deals which the company made.The strong operational momentum gives the company confidence to issue upbeat guidance for the coming year, as the company aggressively pursues the possibilities in a huge takeout market. I can only applaud this strategy, warranting a speculative long-term position.Ending 2014 On A Strong NoteThe earnings report shows that GrubHub ended the year on a strong note, with revenues being up by 50% to $73.3 million. This actually marks a very modest sales acceleration compared to the 49% sales growth reported for the entire year.Adjusted EBITDA rose by 92% to $25.0 million, translating into adjusted EBITDA margins of 34.1%, compared to the full-year margins of 31.0% of sales. Most spectacular has been the improvement in the bottom line with net earnings nearly five-folding to $10.8 million.These kind of earnings improvements show the real high margin potential of the business. After-tax margins totaled 14.7% of sales, as these margins came in at just 9.6% for the entire year. Remember that the business is still investing heavily in future growth which arguably depresses current margins.Strong Operational PerformanceThe revenue growth has been driven by an increase in the usage of GrubHub's services. The number of active users rose by 74% on an annual basis to 5.03 million users.In total these users ordered for $508 million worth of food in the final quarter, a 37% increase compared to a year ago. This means that the average user orders for $101 worth of food through GrubHub this past quarter. The ""cut"" which GrubHub takes came in at 14.4% of the order value on average. This is actually up by some 120 basis points compared to the year before.Two Nice DealsAt the same time the company closed the acquisition of DiningIn as well as announced the purchase of Restaurants on the Run, adding deliveries to more than 3,000 restaurants in key metropolitan areas like Chicago, Dallas, L.A. and San Francisco, among others.These deals add roughly 10% to the number of restaurants being covered. Both businesses have been profitable and have been around for a long time. DiningIn was founded back in 1998 and operates in cities like Boston, Dallas as well as Chicago. Restaurants on the Run was founded five years later, focusing on California, Las Vegas and Seattle.On the conference call, CEO Matthow Maloney confessed that it paid $74 million for the two companies combined, of which roughly 75% has been in the form of cash. These deals which increase the focus on the so-called Tier 2 cities, give the company a strong foothold to grow. After having established dominant positions in Tier-1 cities, GrubHub now aims to grow in smaller cities as well. These two deals add some 3,000 restaurants to the network, covering some 15 markets in total.Revenues will increase by some $25 million as a result of the deals, while both companies are profitable. This comes down to a roughly 3 times sales multiple, compared to GrubHub's own valuation at around 12 times revenues. Including GrubHub's technology, the company aims to show accelerating growth while allowing for cost savings as well. The strong positions in the Tier-2 cities give the company another platform to grow in the future.Premium Valuation, Strong Balance SheetGrubHub operates with a rock-solid balance sheet, containing little over $300 million in cash while the firm has no debt outstanding. These cash holdings exclude the money which GrubHub still has to pay for the two announced deals, seen at around $55 million.At $40 per share, the equity of the company is valued at nearly $3.4 billion which implies that operating assets of the company are valued at a little over $3 billion.Based on the $254 million in revenues reported last year, this results in a steep multiple of nearly 12 times sales and nearly 40 times adjusted EBITDA. This is obviously a very steep multiple, yet the company anticipates rapid growth to continue into 2015. Based on the reported profits just shy of $25 million for the past year, operating assets are valued north of 100 times GAAP earnings.Final ThoughtsGrubHub continues to be on fire as it foresees sales of $84 million for the upcoming quarter, plus or minus a million. This suggests that revenues are growing at roughly 43% year-over-year. Full-year sales are seen at $335 to $350 million which at the midpoint translates into 35% growth on an annual basis.Adjusted EBITDA is seen at $100-$108 million, for margins of around 31%, which is actually in line with the full-year margins reported for 2014. Based on the flattish margin developments and the topline sales growth, I could see net earnings advance to $40-$50 million, still resulting in very steep multiples.That said, I think GrubHub should be applauded for the reason that it is already profitable as it continues to aggressively target growth in a huge market, thereby sacrificing margins in the process.On the conference call, CEO Maloney was pleased with the very strong results. He admitted that the company continues to invest heavily in the business, keeping margins constant in order to gain more market share into the future. The announced deals fit perfectly within those ambitions, aiding GrubHub in faster capturing a significant stake of the $70 billion takeout market. This in itself is just a small portion of the $600 billion spend in US restaurants each year, as Maloney referenced on the call. Note that over the past year, GrubHub achieved gross food sales of $1.8 billion, just 2.5% of the total takeout market.The $70 billion takeout market gives the company a potential $10 billion addressable revenue opportunity, with GrubHub's ""take rate"" seen at around 15%. Currently gross food sales run at a rate of just $2 billion, creating a ton of potential to grow. Just 5% of all orders in this takeout market are done online, which telephone calls continue to be the favored option to order. This is despite the many advantages of online ordering including greater choice, fewer errors and better customer service. This makes lives easier for both customers and the restaurants.As such the aggression with regard to growth should and is being applauded. Aggressive growth strategies are important in this online world in which the winner takes it all, as GrubHub continues to be the absolute market leader. So while shares are very expensive on the current performance metrics, GrubHub is a leader in the industry, grows very rapidly, is set to accelerate growth and is already profitable. If the company can really supply 25% of the takeout market by 2020 or so, this stock is a real winner and potential multi-bagger. This warrants a very small but speculative long-term position for opportunistic investors."
2618315,20568,2014-10-30T13:30:29-04:00,,"Although most stocks have rebounded in recent sessions, many social media and so-called ""web 2.0"" companies have still seen sluggish trading as of late. Earnings have come in weak for many of the top players in this corner of the market, while the outlooks have been disappointing for the most part as well.  Yet depressed prices could mean a buying opportunity for some stocks here, at least if you are willing to go beyond the seemingly always in-focus giants like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). One such company that is a very intriguing buy in this environment is the often-overlooked but extremely practical internet company, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB).  GrubHub in Focus   If you aren’t familiar with GRUB, perhaps you do not order takeout or food delivery that often. The company has become a lifesaver for many consumers looking for food options, as GRUB consolidates the industry’s many options into one spot and lets you know which restaurants are open, what their menus are, and if they deliver to your location.  This service is free to users of their site, but GRUB takes a cut of the orders you place on the site, with some estimates suggesting that this percentage averages over 10%. And as more restaurants jump on board the platform, the ""network effect"" of this business continues to grow, making it a top destination for hungry people everywhere.  GRUB Stock  Grub is a recent IPO, having made its debut less than a year ago. The stock has performed in-line with the overall market since its IPO, but it saw sluggish summer trading and is down over the past three months.  However, the outlook for GRUB is pretty promising as the company continues to expand into new markets and capture more market share. The company founders recently said that GRUB only has single-digit market penetration in many markets, while the international space is also a huge growth avenue, suggesting that the possibilities for GRUB in the near term are endless.  Earnings and Estimates  Although GRUB has a short history as a publicly traded company, it has a pretty good track record on earnings. Though it missed in the previous quarter by 25%, it has posted two strong beats in its other reports, including a 500% beat in its first report, and then a 100% beat in the most recent quarter.  We have also seen some strong earnings estimate revision activity as of late, with the consensus estimate surging in just the past week. For the current quarter, the consensus has moved from 5 cents a share to eight cents a share, while the full year has moved from 20 cents a share to 25 cents a share in the past week, suggesting a growth rate of over 100% for EPS this year.  Bottom Line  GRUB is a great growth stock that is currently trading at a reasonable level following some recent weakness. The stock is poised to see a huge level of EPS growth this year, while it has a near-limitless amount of expansion opportunities at its disposal.  And with recent earnings beats and strong analyst revisions, it shouldn’t be a surprise to note that GRUB has earned itself a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well. So if you are looking to get in on the broader social media/web 2.0 space, consider GRUB as it is often overlooked, but it could be a practical (and profitable) way to play the sector now.

We don't believe that can happen.The impressive growth is artificial: it comes from the company's acquisition of Seamless.In this article, we outline five reasons investors should avoid GrubHub, including an artificially high growth rate, seasonal concerns, tight competition, and more.","There is a crisis in America. We've all experienced it. Picture the following scenario. You are hungry. But:GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) solves this crisis for us hungry people, and makes the process of ordering takeout food easier. According to the company's 10-Q, it acts as an intermediary between takeout diners and restaurants, serving about 4.6 million active diners. GrubHub has relationships with ~30,000 restaurants in 800 U.S. cities (and in London).Awesome. Anything that helps get grub into hungry American (and English) bellies that much faster is something we can get behind. Nevertheless, even the most super-awesome company isn't worth a super awesomely-expensive multiple. In this article, we outline five reasons investors should avoid GrubHub - including an artificially high growth rate, seasonal concerns, tight competition, and more.1. High ValuationWhen it comes to deriving a valuation, we want to avoid forecasting, because we're not good at it. Neither are you. Neither is anyone. It's not a skill humans have mastered. What we can do is use tools that have been developed in order to pick apart what the crowd is collectively forecasting.GrubHub can be worth no more and no less than the net present value all of the cash flows that owners can pull out of it over time. In this article, we'll use net income as a proxy for cash flows. At the moment, we believe the market is way too optimistic about the future of GrubHub. According to GuruFocus:What are the bulls assuming about the future to reconcile all of the above? In other words, at what rate is net income required to grow to take it to a point where the net present value is worth $3 billion? What has to happen to climb a 202-multiple ""hill?"" In order to conduct this exercise, we're going to first have to make some assumptions:If GrubHub grows its net income at a rate of 25% a year every year for the next 34 years, it would produce a total of about ~$3 billion of net present value (discounted at 15%). 34 years! 34 years is a long time - far longer than the time horizon of most retail investors. Few investors buy a company thinking 40 years into the future. To put that number in context, 34 years ago, ""Jessie's Girl"" by Rick Springfield was a number one hit. We don't believe any company - let alone GrubHub - is capable of growing net income 25% a year for 34 years. Even if it could, are you willing to wait almost 40 years assuming an impossibly rosy future for GrubHub?Source: GrubHub financials, Morningstar, author forecastYou can also perform the exercise at higher levels of growth and shorter time periods, or lower growth rates for (much) longer time periods. Doing so would be redundant, though, because whichever assumptions you plug into your future analysis of this company, the result is the same: bulls are assuming an impossibly bright future for the company. Investors can find safer risk-adjusted returns elsewhere.2. Artificially Inflated Growth RateIt gets worse when we consider that GrubHub's impressive growth is artificial. It comes from the company's acquisition of Seamless. As Forbes points out:That means that GrubHub's future growth will grow at a more normalized pace - nowhere near our hyper-charitable assumptions.Source: YChartsEven GrubHub suggests that this rate of growth may be unfeasible. From its 10-Q:This feat of growth is artificially high and unfeasible, even according to GrubHub. Since we don't believe that any company can grow at this rate for long, we believe that the current valuation of GrubHub must come down.3. People Love Going Out During The Summer. Summer Is Bad For GrubHubAs the weather gets warmer, people order less takeout. That means GrubHub might be in for a few tough quarters, where growth naturally slows down. Unfortunately, as we pointed out in point #1, GrubHub's valuation doesn't allow for such natural growth slowdowns.As the company says in its 10-Q:As the winter season draws to an end, GrubHub's sales will take a hit. Investors have high hopes and unrealistic expectations of growth for the company. As investors, we certainly wouldn't want to ""weather"" the first big disappointment and earnings hit of this new, exciting IPO.4. Tight CompetitionGrubHub underperforms the industry massively - for a premium price. Compared to the industry, GrubHub underperforms based on all performance metrics, despite being 6x more expensive than the industry (based on P/E).Source: MorningstarCompetition, too, is tight. From the company's prospectus:We feel that GrubHub's moat is very thin. As MarketWatch suggests:GrubHub has no monopoly: the company has only 1% more relationships than its next closest competitor, Eat24.com. What happens to GrubHub's rich premium if Eat24.com goes public? Further, offering the risk of increased competition in the future, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are now testing mobile ordering apps.5. It's Solely Based On Speculative Price AppreciationIt doesn't help, when a company is highly priced, for it to trade only on the possibility of future price appreciation. No company is worth an infinite multiple. Yet, GrubHub offers little other than a speculative hope. From its 10-Q:We think investors should hold out for a more cheaply priced company - or at the very least, a company that pays investors a dividend.Concluding ThoughtsThere are a number of things that are compelling about this business.These are all reasons to like GrubHub. We support anything that increases the efficiency of getting food into America's collective belly faster. The problem is that even a company that sells water in the Sahara is not worth an infinite price. We value businesses - all businesses - by a common yardstick, and by that yardstick, GrubHub is morbidly overpriced. In this article, we outlined five reasons we think investors should avoid GrubHub: its rich valuation; its unsustainable growth rate (that's artificially high due to an acquisition); the weather-risk that's approaching; its tight competition from similarly sized and much larger peers; and its lack of dividend, that requires stock appreciation that may be challenging at its current prices. Investors should avoid GrubHub till its valuation comes down to Earth."
2890786,48411,2015-02-05T18:55:02-05:00,"GRUB had the blowout Q4 that was expected, what wasn't expected was the announcement of acquisitions.The company's willingness to be aggressive with acquisitions and deploy capital alleviates the primary concern I had at Q3 reporting.GrubHub's announcements confirm my bull thesis - continue to BUY GRUB.","GrubHub Inc.'s (NYSE:GRUB) announcement of a blowout Q4 and full-year 2014 furthers my bull thesis that has been outlined since the IPO. GRUB's most recent results reported - that the company now has over 5 million Active Diners, that its Daily Average Grubs have grown 33% Y/Y to over 200,000 (as of Q4 Y/Y), and that Gross Food Sales eclipsed $1.8 billion on the full year (a 39% increase Y/Y) - have allowed share performance to catch back up to operational performance. Shares have now risen 30% since I initiated coverage shortly after the IPO.Also, GRUB's use of cash examples that management was engaged in the process of looking for shareholder value expansive ways to deploy the growing C&CE balance, something that was my primary concern as of my last update. GRUB's willingness to grow by acquisition and its willingness to acquire ancillary space capacity (namely with its acquisition of DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run) were the factors I was going to be focused on in the near term. This display of aggression and willingness to grow quickly was all that I could have asked for.While the acquisitions announced were unexpected, I did expect yet another excellent quarter from GRUB as the company came through brilliantly. I continue to recommend GRUB as a long position."
3101306,76425,2015-04-24T17:31:53-04:00,GRUB is the industry leader in online food ordering and delivery.The online food ordering and delivery industry has a penetration rate in the single digits.GRUB is testing direct delivery which could further expand top and bottom line growth.,"GrubHub Inc. (NYSE:GRUB) provides an online platform for restaurant delivery and pickup orders. Its platform allows diners to order directly from some 30,000 independent restaurants in more than 800 U.S. cities. Customers pay no additional charge for the service. Restaurants pay a commission to GRUB of 10% or higher. GRUB's strategy is to offer a service that's so easy to use and reliable that people come to rely on it, resulting in restaurants signing on to gain new business.GRUB's competitors are much smaller players such as Eat24 (acquired by Yelp (NYSE:YELP)), Postmates, Sprig, Munchery, Spoonrocket and Uber, but the overall market remains fragmented and under penetrated. ""Restaurant takeout is a $70 billion U.S. market that is 95% offline and ripe for disruption from online and mobile technologies,"" state Sterne Agee research. According to the same report, GRUB is the leader in this market with a 50% market share but has only penetrated 3% of its target market. Further competition comes from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) which offers food takeout and delivery in Seattle. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also could be a competitor through is Google Express services.GRUB merged with Seamless in August of 2012. This is a natural combination of the two largest online food ordering platforms as both companies had ambitions to go public. GRUB is based out of Chicago and has a national presence. Seamless is based mostly in New York. The company's IPO in March of last year was priced at $24/share and was met by a wave of enthusiasm, rising over 35% on the first day.In 2013, GRUB invested heavily on technology that increased the accuracy and efficiency of receiving orders for restaurants and tracking tools that allowed customers to see the status of their order. Earlier this year, the company announced two additional acquisitions and that they had begun providing delivery services on its own in test markets. Management believes that this will provide a more uniform and consistent delivery experience, consistent with the company's strategy as well as offer the opportunity for additional revenue.The shares are expensive if you look at ratios such as PE which according to Yahoo its a triple-digit number or its PS which is also very high. But the PEG is 1.5, which seems to be very reasonable when looking at GRUB's tremendous growth. The 4Q earnings report on Feb. 5 exceeded Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 85% in 2014 to $254 million and net income more than tripled to $24 million as the number of active diners using its services rose 47 percent to about 5 million.Looking at the technical picture, we see that GRUB is riding comfortably aboard its 50 day MA.GRUB data by YChartsThe short position has grown as the price has risen. If GRUB continues growing, a short squeeze is eminent. Investment sentiment continues to be positive. Despite the short interest, three hedge funds established a new position in GRUB over the last quarter.GRUB is the market leader in a growing industry that's in the early innings. There are over 350,000 independent restaurants in the U.S. and the majority have yet to hook up with GRUB or one of its competitors. There also is the possibility of growing internationally as well as further growth by acquisition."
2760715,48411,2014-12-18T06:00:00-05:00,GRUB put together another stellar quarter operationally which is no surprise at this point.GRUB grew its C&CE balance ~$50 million during Q3 as a result of a secondary offering and now boasts ~$278 million in funds.GRUB needs to find more productive outlets for its cash than low yielding investments before its up and coming competition gains too much momentum.With Amazon and InstCart both entering the space indirectly or directly I've moved GRUB to an actively managed long position - this wasn't the case one quarter ago.,"It's been rough sailing for my GrubHub, Inc. (NYSE:GRUB) trade since initiating coverage back in early April. Shares were up just a touch under 40% at their peak and have since fallen way down to today's trading levels up just over 10% since initiation. While that's still outperforming the broader markets it's not quite the performance I expected during the run up to the IPO.I can't be disappointed in GRUB as the company's done nothing but execute on its pre-IPO promises. Operations have been smooth, have outperformed modeling, and have showed a level of consistency I've rarely seen. Most of the share price destruction took place as a result of a secondary offering the company did that helped insiders monetize shares they had been sitting on. I can live with that as the shares were up huge, GRUB was able to raise just under $50 million, and most importantly the company demonstrated to future employees that its shares are monetizable and valuable. In this space that's worth its weight in gold.The broader GRUB story is one that is easy to tell, one that should be easy for management to execute - when speaking in terms of the growth strategy, and one that should provide outsized returns for many quarters to come. GRUB, the online food ordering platform operator, is the 800 pound gorilla in the space currently. At least for right now the plan is to ramp up spending in actual dollars (but as we'll find out the spending is actually a smaller percentage of total sales), increase brand awareness, continue to build brand integrity, and continue to leverage the considerable network effects that the company is already seeing. Historically, this has allowed the company to drive operations at levels of growth that are highly uncommon even in technology. Even with the results it reported for the first nine months of 2014 the company still only has roughly a 2.5% market share with a current annual run rate of gross food sales of $1.7 billion. I detailed in a previous article how I think the company can service as much as double its current market share before the next level of scale-up. I'll detail in this article how that would affect profitability from a margin standpoint.There's not much else to tell about the actual business model GRUB has; it's really just an app that allows people to find food for delivery. For what it's worth, I will admit that there is a low barrier to entry for competition. Even being a pre-IPO bull I understand that should a well-funded competitor try to steal market share that GRUB could be on a slippery slope. I also think the GRUB could begin to see pressure from ancillary food ordering applications like InstCart and Amazon Fresh (InstaCart is not a direct competitor but could still provide top-line pressure by introducing a solution for non-restaurant food ordering solutions). This is something I'm watching closely which I will monitor via GRUB'S key metrics. I'm still working on how to model this out and on finding correlations between GRUB and competitors, meaning how to front-run any problems GRUB would see during reporting by tracking any success that it's under the radar competitors may be having but as of right now it's a complete work in progress. For now though, the simplicity of the GRUB model is actually contributing to its execution. Spend more, grow more. For now that's good enough for me.With that being said, I think it's really important for GRUB to acknowledge this and to ramp up spending in a big way, much bigger than it has currently stated. GRUB has the cash to do this and even has the cash to expand operations via acquisition - which I think it should seriously consider. GRUB should work on finding ways to make itself more entrenched in user's lifestyles. I'm not sure exactly how to do this at this point but I'm expecting GRUB management to come up with some better option for the cash sitting on its balance sheet than investing it in low yielding investments. GRUB's main priority for 2015 should be building a barrier against competition stealing market share. It's spent the last 10 years developing the Chicago, and by way of its Seamless acquisition, New York markets. It must assure investors that it didn't simply lay the tracks down for future competitors to come along and steal share. Again, this isn't a reason for me to sell the stock right now, but it is something that is a growing concern to me considering approaching competitors. The fact that Amazon is entering the space is probably my main concern. They are well-funded and don't mind operating at a loss to aggregate market share. Stay tuned for updates on this.A quick look at GRUB's balance sheet:Again you'll notice in red the updated cash balance reflecting the secondary offering proceeds and also notice the absence of any debt. I applaud GRUB for being able to grow its business without getting levered up to this point but at this point the game has changed. I again would encourage GRUB management to use its cash and even consider using leverage to grow the top-line as fast as possible. GRUB is operating at a considerable profitability point which could allow it to make concessions either from the balance sheet or on the income statement side to further market share. I'm not saying that more spending across the board would be more efficacious but what I am saying is the company has the opportunity right now to do something that it may not have in the future. That opportunity is be the front of mind solution for the problem it is looking to solve and to become a brand name with a defensible leadership position. Many competitors with substantially the same product as Coca-Cola and Pepsi have come along and failed to unseat the undisputed leaders in the space. I think this could be a possibility for GRUB as well but only if it is willing to take risks here and now in the short-term.GRUB's income statement and operating results will show that GRUB has plenty of room for expense expansion before even coming to breakeven on the net income line. For clarity, GRUB has been wildly successful in driving its financials forward in the absence of spending, something I would like to see ramped up:Both the nine months and the three-month results show improvements to profitability. Starting with Q3 results, GRUB was able to grow its top-line by 75% year-over-year and with total cost and expenses falling 10% as a percentage of sales in 2014 it was able to drive its income from operations 270%. Income from operations grew from 9% of total sales to 19%, an incredible figure. This drove GRUB's net income 214% year-over-year and drove net margins 400 basis points year-over-year, again an incredible figure. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margins were 33%, a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year. You can begin to see what I mean when I say that the company has considerable room to expand on expenses. The company's operations were largely driven by the increases in expenses that it did make. Most notably the company's operations and margins expanded during Q3 as a result of the new pricing mechanism for the Seamless platform. This new mechanism allows restaurants to bid for preferential listing or priority sorting on the company's application. While the company has guided that this effect to operations should top out in the quarter it's still very encouraging to see.The nine month results were just as productive. Revenue actually grew even faster at a pace of 105% year-over-year. Again, with total costs and expenses remaining in check and actually falling 500 basis points year-over-year, income from operations rose 500 basis points as well. Inclusive of higher stock-based compensation, costs associated with the IPO, and costs associated with the secondary offering, net margin still grew 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted net margin grew 100 basis points as well. Nine month operations were driven largely by the same factors that drove Q3 operations but had the press down effects of the above listed items to offset. The nine month operations are yet another indication of the pulley and lever like system with which the company can control its income statement. More spending, more growth. There's not much to argue with when it comes to the income statement or the margins. Everything looks good.Wrapping up with a look at cash the company continued to generate more cash flow inclusive of less productive line items from operations:The company has seen a huge build to cash provided by operating activities even showing approximately $5 million build to AR (reduction to cash inflows) and an approximately $2.5 million reduction to account payables (increase in cash outflows). This would have seen the company generate free cash flow of approximately $42 million excluding the purchase of investments. It's that type of free cash flow that more than suggests the company should greatly accelerate growth by greatly accelerating spending. For as long as you're able to generate that type of free cash flow and having substantially zero contractual obligation outflows you should want to put that cash to immediate use. This is something that management has not done to this point. It's semi-frustrating seeing shares dive the way they have recently knowing that the company has what equates to a bazooka ready to be fired. With this growing frustration I'll look for updates from management as to what exactly they have planned for the cash hoard.Where's the trade?All told I'm very happy with the results operationally since owning GRUB. However, if the share price doesn't reflect these results I'm left on the sidelines with very little to take home (no pun intended). I think the company has plenty of flexibility at least at this point in time to continue its fast-paced land and expand. I simply would ask the company to use all the tools it has available to drive operations and to drive share price.The company hasn't failed to come through on any promises to this point but the narrative of the space is changing and it's changing quickly. I'm not willing to go bearish the name just yet but I am as an owner under considerably more pressure than I was in early April. I've now moved GRUB into a more actively managed allocation within my portfolio. This was not the case just one quarter ago.I'll continue to very closely manage this position until GRUB can either build a more significant barrier to entry or find some type of competitive advantage that would allow it to continue to grow operations with more competition without making concessions to customers.At this point I would still recommend a long position in GRUB but one that is much more actively managed.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
3230936,84206,2015-06-02T15:41:16-04:00,"The Q1 EPS miss triggered the market to overreact, which created a discount that still exists.The flurry of recent insider activity may have contributed to the creation of a discount.Investors can rest assured that GrubHub still has room to grow in light of encouraging Q2 guidance.Investors should not be scared off by decelerating revenue and EBITDA growth, as the shares still carry a comfortable intrinsic value.","The market punished GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) following its EPS miss as part of Q1 results released about a month ago. The aftermath caused the shares to drop more than 15% from their high, creating a discount that is still available. It seems that the market was focused solely on seeing the EPS beat expectations - but why?The future is exceptionally bright for GrubHub, especially considering the encouraging Q1 numbers that seemed to have been overshadowed by the EPS miss. Trading in the past month certainly does not reflect this potential. Not to mention, EPS came in only $0.02 short of its target. So, why did the market react so harshly to the miss? I believe the answer lies in two things.First, a major factor was simple oversight of GrubHub's capital structure. A downfall of the EPS metric is that it favors companies that are financed by debt, since leverage generates earnings but is not reflected in the denominator of EPS (an exception being convertible debt in diluted EPS). On the other hand, a company like GrubHub that is financed by equity alone is unfairly punished by EPS, since the full source of financing is therefore added into the denominator, reducing it. With this being the case, I believe that EPS was one of GrubHub's less important metrics in the Q1 earnings release; rather, investors should have focused on the growth in revenue, EBITDA, and active GrubHub diners.A second source of responsibility for the overreaction can be attributed to the slew of recent insider sales. Frequently, it seems that investors see insiders selling and begin to think that they should be selling too, when in reality the insider was selling for personal reasons or their options expired according to a predetermined schedule. In either case, the insider sell-off is not necessarily representative of what is actually taking place in the business. With that being said, it seems that investors typically choose to assume the worst - that the insiders selling believe the stock price will decline. Below is a table that shows the timing of significant insider sell-offs in conjunction with Q1 earnings:As illustrated by the table and GRUB's chart, these events certainly generated downward pressure that caused investors to panic, accelerating the pressure. As a result, a discount was created among GRUB shares that still exists at the current price level of approximately $41. Below is a full valuation that should shed light on why the market has GrubHub wrong.Free Cash Flow to Equity ValuationPerhaps investors are wary that revenue and EBITDA growth aren't sustainable. This argument may have some merit, considering that revenue and EBITDA experienced year-over-year growth of 85% and 138%, respectively, between 2013 and 2014, whereas guidance suggests growth will be 40% and 55%, respectively, between 2014 and 2015. This does represent a substantial deceleration in growth rates, yet they still remain very high. I have performed a two-stage free cash flow-to-equity (FCFE) valuation that incorporates deceleration of these growth rates, and despite this, the valuation indicates that the shares are trading at a discount.I use EBIT as the starting line for the calculation of free cash; however, I first project EBITDA in order to incorporate EBITDA guidance into the model. After projecting EBITDA and depreciation, depletion and amortization, I make a simple calculation to arrive at the EBIT. The midpoint for full-year revenue guidance for 2015 is $353.5 million, which I used in the projection shown above. Additionally, I included the midpoint of full-year EBITDA guidance of $105 million for 2015. For revenue, this guidance represents 39% year-over-year growth. To be cognizant of the deceleration of the growth rates as discussed at the beginning of the article, I projected revenue and EBITDA to grow at a rate that declines 3% each year (i.e., 36% growth in 2016, 33% in 2017, 30% in 2018, 27% in 2019). Realistically, the declining growth rate may prove to be overly conservative. In this case, the gap between market and intrinsic value could be larger than estimated.The next step prior to calculating free cash is to project working capital accounts and capital expenditures. I projected these at the average growth rate experienced in the past three years for each respective account, except for situations where the growth rate was wildly inconsistent. For example, instead of using the average cash and cash equivalents' growth rate over the past three years, which would have been over 450%, I used a much more conservative growth rate of about 35%. Although 35% may seem high, the year-end balance of the cash & cash equivalents accounts have more than doubled in each of the past three years, which indicates that cash growth could be much greater than 35%. Since management may want to keep debt off the balance sheet, another source of cash growth may be the issuance of additional common equity. This is alone is the primary reason that cash growth has outpaced net income and retained earnings growth in past years.Using the projections discussed above, I calculated free cash for the next five years and discounted at the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which I will discuss below. As a result, stage one generates a discounted sum of $624 million of free cash for the projected fiscal years of 2015 through 2019.Since GrubHub does not carry any debt, the WACC is equal to the cost of equity, which I estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The three required components of CAPM are the risk-free rate, the expected return of the market, and the beta of the company. I used 1.88% as the risk-free rate, which is the current rate on 10-year Treasury bills. Furthermore, I used 0.67 as the beta (taken from Nasdaq.com on the date of valuation) and 11.53% as the expected return of the market, which represents the historical average return of the S&P 500. This results in a market risk premium of 9.65%. By multiplying the market risk premium by the beta and adding the risk-free rate, I arrived at the estimated WACC of 8.35% - a critical figure used in both stage one and stage two. My own research indicates that other analysts have estimated a similar figure for GRUB's WACC, generally in the range of 8-10%.The second stage of the analysis is the estimation of the terminal value (stage two). I chose to project terminal value growth at 3.27%, which represents average historical annual GDP growth. As a result, I estimated the present value of the terminal value to be roughly $2.64 billion. Thus, adding stage one ($624.13 million) to stage two ($2,643.99 million) results in estimated free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) of $3,268 million. At this point, there is one final calculation required to arrive at cash flow-to-equity and the resulting estimated fair value per share of GrubHub.This final step is the conversion of free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) to free cash flow-to-equity (FCFE). By subtracting net debt from FCFF (in this case I added it, since cash exceeds debt), I arrived at FCFE of $4.17 billion. In other words, I believe that GrubHub's market cap should be roughly $4.17 billion, and that shares are fairly valued at approximately $51. This represents an approximately 25% upside from the $40.79 that shares were trading at on Monday, when I performed the valuation. As you can see, despite the deceleration in revenue and EBITDA growth rates, GrubHub still presents considerable value at its current price. Prior to the release of Q1 earnings, shares were trading at a high of about $48 and seemed to be on their way to reaching $50. However, I believe that investors misinterpreted the EPS miss, and a significant discount has resulted. With that said, if you have room in your portfolio, it may be wise to pick up a few shares of GrubHub before the discount disappears."
2517685,71145,2014-09-24T10:34:45-04:00,Investors have sold GrubHub down after its second offering.Insiders have led in the offering.Management misled in 2013 growth rates.,"Management's decision to engage in a secondary offering so soon after its IPO is one of many concerns investors should be aware of. In August, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) filed to offer 10 million of its shares with the company offering 1.25 million shares while shareholders, including management and its board would offer 8.78 million. The Chicago based company raised a greater-than-projected $193 million in its initial public offering in April and has a market value of about $3.2 billion.The second offering, which has led to a sell-off, is only one part of the significant problems tied to valuation and competition. In addition, the recent string of insider sell-offs is not a good sign for investors.Background:Shares of the online and mobile food-ordering service had surged 64% from their April IPO price of $26, but have plummeted on the news of share dilution. The rise of GrubHub shares could be due to the overall bull sentiment of the market but can also be attributed to misrepresentation of its growth rate. The company boasted a 67%, 2013 growth rate, by combining sales of two different platforms: GrubHub and Seamless. However for 2012, the company uses Seamless' revenue results of 82.1 million. This gross misrepresentation is not fair to investors and should not be forgotten when one evaluates the company's management.Second Offering:The sale is expected to raise about $50.7 million in net proceeds for GrubHub while funds affiliated with private equity firms Spectrum Equity, GS Capital Partners, Warburg Pincus, Benchmark Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners all plan to sell off 1 to 2 percent of their holdings.Management Offering:The combination of a management led second offering with the past misconception of growth rate should be disconcerting. CEO Matthew M. Maloney sold 183,089 shares in a transaction dated Wednesday, September 3rd. The stock was sold at an average price of $40.25 making the total transaction worth $7,369,332.25.Also Insider Margo Drucker sold 25,612 shares on September 3rd for a total transaction of $1,030,883.00. Drucker now directly owns only 5,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $201,250.In addition, President Jonathan Zabusky sold 298,801 shares of GrubHub stock in a transaction dated Wednesday, September 3rd. The shares were sold at an average price of $40.25, for a total value of $12,026,740.25.Conclusion:Although GrubHub beat second quarter revenue projects, the company should worry investors because of its management and share dilution. Share prices have dipped over 18.32% over the month and seem likely to dip even further with the Russell Index experiencing intense selling pressure."

Within these small restaurants, takeout accounts for a big share of revenues—nearly $67 billion were spent on takeout by Americans in 2013.GrubHub’s FinancialsNew York-based GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is among the leading online and mobile platforms for restaurant takeout and delivery orders. GrubHub’s platform enables diners to place an order for delivery directly through their website. They help the restaurants by making their menus and offers available online through their site. They help the diners by providing them a platform that is high on UI, which personalizes recommendations based on their browsing history.The company has tie-ups with 28,800 restaurants in more than 600 cities in the country. GrubHub claims that their system leaves no room for order errors as they have a “direct line” into the kitchen. GrubHub strengthened their position in the market when they acquired Seamless in 2013 for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition helped GrubHub grow in Seamless’ focus market of New York.Their platform processed more than 135,000 daily average meals in 2013. Their platform also helped restaurants deliver $1.3 billion in Gross Food Sales. The number of active diners increased by 1.9 million to 3.4 million as of December 2013. Their revenues grew 67% over the year to $137.1 million. They ended the year with a net income of $6.7 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $38.1 million.For the recently ended second quarter, GrubHub saw revenues grow 48% over the year to $60 million, significantly ahead of the Street’s estimate of $54.7 million. They ended the quarter with active diners growing to 4.19 million and the number of daily average grubs growing to 174,500 compared with 130,100 a year ago. EPS of $0.03 missed the market’s projections of $0.04.GrubHub expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $55.5 million-$57.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $13 million-$15 million. The market was looking for revenues of $54.3 million.GrubHub’s CompetitionRecently, the online restaurant platform market has attracted a lot of attention. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced their plans to enter the food takeout service by extending the Amazon Local offering. Users will be able to place an order for takeout through the Local app. Online travel giant Priceline (PCLN) also entered the restaurant reservation market by purchasing OpenTable for $2.6 billion. The acquisition led to a lot of speculation by analysts who expected GrubHub to be next on the block. Some even believe that Amazon may be able to expand their takeout service by acquiring GrubHub.Till earlier this year, GrubHub was venture funded with $84 million in funding from Mesirow Financial, Greenspring Associates, Lightspeed Venture Partners, DAG Ventures, Benchmark, Amicus Capital, Origin Ventures, and Leo Capital Holdings. In April this year, they went public and raised $200 million by selling 7.4 million shares at $26 each on the NYSE. Their stock is trading at $35.49 with a market capitalization of $2.84 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $45.80 last month."
2525625,21791,2014-09-28T05:32:25-04:00,"From initial IPO on April 3rd, 2014, 70,980,172 shares of 78,385,786 were restricted from sale until 181 days after date of prospectus, October 1st, 2014.After the follow on offering on August 25th, 2014, the lock-up on Approx. 52 million shares moved out to November 24th.Based on my opinion of valuation concern, coupled with lock-up expirations, I expect a pullback in Grubhub shares in the coming weeks and months ahead .","I first wrote about GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) on May 9th when shares were trading at about $33 per share. I suggested shares could fall back to as low as $20 a share by the end of the year from their initial IPO price of $26.I cited 3 main reasons for such a pullback:Since the time I wrote about GrubHub, shares have traded mostly higher hitting as high as $45.80 just last month. As I write now, shares are back to the mid $30's again.I noted my concern about valuation based on its market capitalization relative to earnings and growth not justifying what is now a $2.8 billion company. The company is expected to have revenue of $241 million and net earnings of 33 cents per share or approximately $26 million for fiscal year 2014.I also noted concern with potential fierce competition from the likes of smaller, local mom and pop type online ordering companies. Ithaca-To-Go is one such company we have here in Ithaca, NY that competes directly with GrubHub. Ithaca-To-Go has their own drivers for delivery as well, something GrubHub does not offer.GrubHub went through five rounds of fundraising since its founding, and from the balance sheet ended March 31st, 2014, a total of $486,782,000 was listed as paid-in capital. It's those initial investors whose capital helped build GrubHub to the company it is today.Deservedly so, those initial investors are reaping the fruits of the risk they took with their investment and can now, with the access to the public markets, begin to sell their shares and take their profits.The first IPO in April sold 7.405 million shares of which 4 million shares were newly issued and the remaining 3.4 million shares were sold by existing shareholders. The price was $26 a share.That was the first instance where initial investors had an opportunity to sell their shares and take profits on their investment.Post the IPO in April, approximately 78.4 million shares would be outstanding and of those 78.4 million shares, from the prospectus:*Note: The date of this prospectus was April 7, 2014. However, the IPO was April 3rd, and 181 days after April 3rd, is October 1st. I confirmed this with GrubHub's IR Dept.GrubHub went through a secondary offering announced on August 25. Initial investors and insiders would take advantage in the rising share price to sell shares via a secondary offering. Approximately 10.468 million shares would be sold while only 1.25 million would be newly issued. The remaining 9.218 million shares would be sold to the public from existing initial investors including management and members of the board of directors. The price of the offering was $40.25.GrubHub noted in its IPO prospectus back in April that part of the reason for going public was:It's the ""create a market for our common stock"" that seems to be the biggest use of proceeds from the share offerings.My bias is that insiders and initial investors are very eager to take their profits as can be seen with their selling in these first two rounds of IPOs.The initial $500 million of paid-in capital helped build a company that now has a market cap of $2.8 billion, so initial investors are clearly sitting on a good deal of profits as I write.Investors have to consider that the lock-up period of the remaining 62 million insider owned shares or so become unlocked and available for sale in the public markets starting Wednesday, October 1 when I calculate approximately 10 million of those shares become unlocked.The remaining approximately 52 million shares that are owned by the sellers of shares in the August 25th follow on offering remain locked until 90 days after the date of that filing, which will be November 24th, 2014.My bias is that the selling may well outweigh the buying and take shares lower, perhaps as low as my initial target of $20 a share by the end of the year. At $20 a share, with 80.081 million shares outstanding puts the market cap at $1.6 billion or so.For a little perspective on the balance sheet of GrubHub, as of June 30th, 2014 notes total shareholders' equity of $681 million. On the asset side, $614 million is intangible and goodwill assets. This is from the use of initial investment capital being used to acquire other online ordering platforms at a premium to net tangible asset value.This leaves GrubHub with a shareholders' net tangible asset equity value of just $67 million.At $34.41 a share now, 80.081 million shares outstanding put the market cap of GrubHub at $2.755 billion.I expect to see both selling pressure and a pullback in share price in the coming weeks and months ahead."
2393125,62463,2014-08-07T03:19:21-04:00,"While commentators continue to argue as to whether the Western markets are overvalued, hedge funds are taking positions in some sectors as though they are.Much ink has recently been spilled over valuations in the online food sector – both in the U.K and the U.S.Is there an appetizing meal to be found?","Two recent IPOs - Just-Eat Group and GrubHub Inc. - both seem to have alarmingly bullish expectations built into current market prices - no doubt a significant factor in the decision of the hedge funds to take a negative view.Lift the tableclothInvestors often assume that recent IPOs somehow are priced so that high returns are assured. Look at the retail demand for Facebook after its recent IPO. They should pause and review some of the literature around the mean/median returns for IPOs - the truth isn't quite so attractive, particularly if the companies that are listed have come from a venture capital background. According to the abstract for a seminal paper by Jay Ritter at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991 --It is incorrect to assume that investors demand very high annualized and cumulative rates of return to compensate for the risks they are taking by financing ventures in different sectors of the economy. The mean rates of return are found to be, in practice, very moderate, and often, negative.Such academic findings, uninfluenced by the conflicts of interest inherent in much broker research, are very interesting. It makes you consider the ECM and IPO business lines, and the huge fees created through these listings. Obviously the larger the valuation, the greater the fee to the broker. Therefore the balancing act between ensuring a successful opening and maximising the exit price for their clients is inherently treacherous.Recent IPOs in the U.K., such as Royal Mail Group Ltd. (OTCPK:ROYMF), have openly exposed this dilemma with government / taxpayer fury at the apparently inexpensive float price. On the other hand, private investors are not quite so generous to those that come after. Certainly neither GrubHub nor Just Eat have performed well subsequent to their flotation.Turning to GrubHub, the stock has a 10 year implied EPS growth level of 39.4% - meaning the company is going to grow at around 40% every year for the next 10. To Dec. 14 it will achieve a 73.6% growth rate, slowing to 28.1% for FY2, based on StarMine projections.Any commentator who tells you the long-term growth of a company is fooling themselves - you're attempting to model future company behavior, competitor behavior, economic factors and consumer behavior. Of course, if the company does start to make significant super normal profits, then the numbers of competitors will multiply. What can be said with certainty is that it's very dangerous to assume such a successful bump-free ride for investors. GrubHub also looks eye-wateringly expensive from a P/E standpoint, trading at 100.2 times FY1 earnings.Stir the potFrom a models perspective, StarMine certainly gives pause to think -GrubHub has a short interest model in the bottom 1% (the 1% of North American stocks most shorted based on index data, allowing for the amount of free float). Equally, GrubHub has an Intrinsic Valuation score of 2 and Relative Valuation score of 5. Of course, the company continues to score well based on positive changes in analyst sentiment - it's in the 96th percentile.Hold the pepperoniJust Eat is a U.K. equivalent, now providing home delivery options in 13 markets, primarily Europe but also including Canada, India and Brazil. The valuation has recently declined from its post IPO high of 85, down to the current level of 60 times. Despite the selloff, the price remains hard to justify, particularly when compared to Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) in the U.K., which gets the majority of its orders online. Domino's has an F12M P/E of 19.2, growing EPS at 7% this year and 20% next year.While Domino's reported revenue of £268.9 million for the year ending 2013 - Just Eat reported £96.75 million for the same period. Yet Domino's market cap is £913 million, compared to Just Eat's £1.21 billion. Is there a secret sauce that justifies the difference in valuations? If the growth rate is sustainable then obviously Just Eat will catch up and exceed Domino's - but the market is ruling that a fait accompli. As Yogi Berra put it - ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.""Fundamental change is occurring in the way we purchase many goods and services online - Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the most obvious example. Yet shareholders in that online behemoth have had a tough run of late.

2510905,25120,2014-09-22T02:56:44-04:00,"Analysts at Bank of America are bullish on GrubHub, citing long term favorable trends.I largely agree, as long as the potential market is really as large as anticipated, given that the business can maintain its dominant position.The stock has potential to become a long term multi-bagger, but it will be a long and uncertain road ahead.","Shares of GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) failed to gain ground on the final trading day of the week despite receiving some positive comments from analysts.Like many start-up and technology names the current valuation based on today's performance is high, although the company has some real potential if it can continue to be a market leader in the future market for eating out, allow for a potential multi-bagger in the long run.Bank of America Is BullishAnalyst Nat Schindler who is employed by Bank of America initiated GrubHub at a buy rating which has been accompanied by a $47 price target.Schindler has a few reasons to be optimistic on the prospects for the shares. For starters is the increased adoption for smartphones in making transactions. Other drivers are the early penetration of a large addressable market, competitive barriers and the potential to expand margins.The biggest potential driver might be the low diner penetration given that only 2% of order are placed online are through mobile.Solid Second Quarter ResultsIt has been the end of July since GrubHub last posted its results. The company posted second quarter revenues of $60.0 million, a 48% increase versus last year. Revenues rose slightly on a sequential basis despite the cold winter, which actually helped GrubHub's business as the second quarter is typically seasonally soft.The company is already profitable and posts great adjusted margins. Adjusted EBITDA jumped by 56% towards $16.9 million with net earnings of $2.7 million nearly tenfolded versus last year. It should be noted that earnings have been understated due to a $6.1 million tax bill to be paid for the quarter.Growth was driven by an increased customers base with some 4.19 million people being active, a 51% jump versus last year. On average these users have been a bit less active with average daily orders increasing by 34% towards 174,500 per day. Total gross food sales rose by 34% to $423 million, suggesting a commission rate of a very fat 14%.Third Quarter GuidanceAt the time the company issued a third quarter guidance which calls for sales of $55.5 million to $57.5 million with adjusted EBITDA seen between $13 and $15 million.Strong Cash Position, Recently FortifiedAt the end of the second quarter, GrubHub held some $207 million in cash and equivalents, not having any debt outstanding.At the start of this month the company announced the sale of nearly 10.5 million shares by the company and some of its selling shareholders. Unfortunately the press release did not specify how many shares were sold by the company, and thereby how much cash ended up in its bank account.At the end of the quarter, there were some 82 million shares outstanding, a number which has risen towards 92.5 million shares following the secondary offering. At $38 per share, equity in the business is valued at $3.5 billion. This values operating assets at around $3.3 billion, or potentially a little less depending on how many shares were sold by the company in the secondary offering.A simple extrapolation of second quarter revenues yields $240 million in annual sales and roughly $10 million in earnings which are depressed by too high income taxes. More normalized earnings, adjusted for the high tax rate, could come in the $20-$30 million range.The multiples based on the current performance remain very high with operating assets trading around 14 times annualized revenues and over a hundred times earnings.A More Detail Look At The BusinessIn June, GrubHub presented itself to its investors outlining its mission to make takeout better by connecting hungry diners with their local restaurants. The company is the largest takeout marketplace having 30,000 restaurants in its base, across some 700 cities.The company which is made up out of brands like GrubHub, Seamless, Menupages and Allmenus posts rapid growth in a still underpenetrated market.The company stresses that there are some 350,000 independent restaurants within the US, with customers spending $67 billion on takeout, which results in a potential $8.5 to $9.5 billion addressable market based on 13-14% commission rates. Just 5% of all these orders are done online with the rest online or being called-in.Restaurants like the company for the ease of orders, new customers gained, higher margin on take-out and insight of order data. Diners like the company given the choice, ease of use and great customer service. Those using the service are big fans and have already largely made the switch towards mobile offerings which generate roughly half of the orders at the moment.Final ThoughtsShares of GrubHub were sold to the general public in April of this year as I had a look at the prospects for the shares at the time.At the time shares were offered for $26 per share as they immediately rose to levels in the mid-thirties, ever since having traded in a $30-$45 trading range.I ended up concluding that GrubHub was already profitable, which was can not be said of every IPO these days. Operating at the intersection of food and technology results in the potential for a transformation in a huge industry. The network effects and brand familiarity could result in a ¨winner-takes-it-all¨ outcome, making the valuation much more appealing. That being said, justifying today's valuation does require some imagination and a few more rounds of success.This continues to be the story as the valuation relies largely on what the company can be, rather than what it already is. At the time I calculated the prospects on the back of a market share of 30% for the $70 billion takeout market. This could result in $2.5-$3.0 billion in revenues based on the commission rates. This could lead to big profits and could allow the shares to multiply by a few times, but obviously more competition might be in the cards by already established and still unknown players.As such Bank of America's analysts are right if the promising trends continue. The company has a lot of cash so it either becomes along term success story, or a niche player being outsmarted by competition which is still way behind at the moment. You get the point, GrubHub is a very promising business, but carries above-average risks and return potential."

Yelp stock rose 14% on Friday and GrubHub shares gained 7% after Priceline agreed to pay a 47% premium on top of OpenTable's market capitalization. Yelp is the most widely predicted takeover target on the crowdsourced M&A predictions platform Mergerize.com, and last week's news has investors betting that an acquisition might be in the near future for Yelp as well.Yelp's stock hasn't performed particularly well in 2014 as the company was adversely affected by the rotation from high momentum growth names to more stable and larger companies. The swing was especially brutal between March and April when Yelp shares tumbled from a high of $101.75 to $54.68 for a loss of nearly 50%.(Click here for chart details)Although Yelp has struggled with profitability over the past two years and has failed to post positive earnings in any single quarter, the company's revenue has been increasing steadily. In March the broad sell-off targeted stocks with high (or negative) price to earnings ratios like Yelp, but consistent revenue growth and the promotion of its 2013 acquisition, SeatMe, leaves plenty of upside in play for Yelp.(Click here for chart details)SeatMe is an online and mobile reservation app designed to go toe to toe with OpenTable which currently dominates the market. Yelp offers similar user generated content (ratings and reviews) compared to OpenTable, but its SeatMe app its poised to become a much cheaper alternative for restaurants to fill available seats than OpenTable. On average OpenTable's combined monthly subscription and per reservation charges add up to a $697 monthly bill to restaurants using the service. Comparatively, SeatMe offers a similar service for only $99 per month, with no additional variable costs.For obvious reasons, SeatMe could quickly become a thorn in OpenTable's side if the platform can gain some traction among diners. The only potential roadblock here is the first mover advantage that OpenTable has. OpenTable already has table hunters on its platform which it offers to users for free. But it's not an impossible problem for Yelp to solve.Yelp has become one of the most well-known and trusted mobile and desktop apps for restaurant reviews. Many OpenTable users go on Yelp first to find which restaurant they would like to eat at before switching back over to OpenTable to book a reservation. Yelp is already dangling its reservation app on its review pages. With more promotion SeatMe may be able to cut OpenTable out of the reservation booking process completely and gain adoption from restaurants and users alike.(Click here for chart details)GrubHub recently had its IPO and unveiled fundamental financial information to investors. GrubHub, which merged with Seamless in 2013, offers online and mobile apps where customers can order and pay for online restaurant deliveries. Like Yelp and OpenTable, much of the value of GrubHub comes from its user generated ratings and reviews. The large premium that Priceline paid to acquire OpenTable is a sign that companies are placing a ton of value in community assets that generate their own content.GrubHub has its own restaurant ratings and reviews, but the company is still somewhat vulnerable to Yelp in a similar fashion to OpenTable. The advantage that GrubHub has over OpenTable is that its platform carries a lower risk of being copied. Reservation search and booking isn't too complicated of a process. There are only three variables involved - the name of the restaurant, party size, and the desired time of the reservation. The real differentiators for reservation booking apps are the quantity and quality of content, and the price point for restaurants, two areas where Yelp may have a leg up on OpenTable. On the other hand, building a platform where restaurants can create their own clickable and customizable online menus including a mobile payments system is a much more difficult undertaking, and that offers some hope of protection for GrubHub.Although GrubHub's revenue has more than doubled on a year over year basis in each of the previous two quarters, Yelp is the king of content and the food-tech company getting all the attention in the rumor mill. On Mergerize 14 predictions have been made that Yelp will be acquired within one year. The mostly commonly predicted acquirer is Yahoo (YHOO) with 7 analysts believing Yahoo will look to acquire Yelp after its windfall from the Alibaba IPO. The average predicted takeover price on Mergerize is $7.81B, and the news of the OpenTable deal just increased Yelp's market capitalization by more than $750M to $5.34B. If Yelp were to be acquired today for the same 47% premium that Priceline paid for OpenTable, the sale price would be around $7.85B. Maybe there is some wisdom in the crowd for M&A after all.Disclosure: None."
2143313,25120,2014-04-15T16:23:10-04:00,"Merger between GrubHub and Seamless results in scale and execution risks.Headline sales results are ""inflated"" as a result of the merger.Yet, the future opportunity is enormous for this market leader.","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) made its public debut at the start of April. Shares of the online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders have seen their fair share of volatility ever since, but are generally trading up following their debut.The company is a market leader through an engineered merger last year, standing to benefit from a huge market opportunity in the coming years. Yet, the current valuation leaves quite some execution risks, and I do not believe that the current levels leave a great entry opportunity for investors, despite aggressive growth and the fact that the company is already profitable.The Public OfferingGrubHub processes takeouts, connecting local restaurants in over 600 US cities with consumers in order to transform the takeout experience. The company focuses on a strong platform, creating a ""direct"" line with the kitchen in order to avoid confusion, inefficiency and inaccuracies, thereby allowing independent restaurants to boost their sales.GrubHub sold 7.4 million shares for $26 a piece, thereby raising $192.5 million in gross proceeds. Note that some 4 million shares are sold by the company itself, raising $104 million in gross proceeds for the business, while the remainder of the shares are offered by selling shareholders.Initially, bankers and the firm set an initial price range of $20-$22 per share, which later got revised upwards toward $23-$25 per share. Strong demand pushed the final offering price another dollar higher than the high end of the already raised range.Some 9% of the total shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. At Monday's closing price of $35.16 per share, the firm is valued at $2.7 billion.The major banks that brought the company public were Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, BMO Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, Raymond James and William Blair.ValuationGrubHub is all about making live easier for both consumers as well as restaurants. Customers can try new restaurants with easy and online ordering, while restaurants can boost sales without adding waiting staff or tables. According to a report prepared by Euromonitor, US consumers spent about $204 billion across 350,000 restaurants back in 2012. GrubHub itself reckons about a third of this amount is spent on takeout.The new GrubHub is the product of a merger which took place in August of last year, when Seamless and GrubHub turned into one company, putting 28,800 restaurants on their combined platform. In total, there are about 3.4 million users making active use of the service, taking out an average of 135,000 Grubs a day in 2013.For the year of 2013, GrubHub generated revenues of $137.1 million, up 66.6% on the year before. Impressively, GrubHub reported earnings of $6.7 million, which was down in the year before on the back of very steep tax provisions. Operating earnings did, however, show a healthy rise.Note that growth was inflated by the merger, of course, and the ""inflation"" of top line revenue growth is discussed in this well-written Forbes article. Note that GrubHub takes an impressive cut. The reported revenues of $137.1 million for last year were achieved on $1.05 billion in actual food sales, implying an average commission rate of 13% by the intermediary.The company operates with $86.5 million in cash on a pre-IPO basis, and the offering will allow it to roughly double its cash balances. GrubHub has no debt outstanding. The current $2.7 billion valuation values operating assets just north of $2.5 billion. This implies a valuation of roughly 18 times annual revenues and a non-meaningful profit multiple.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of GrubHub has been a great success. The company priced the offering at $26 per share, some 23.8% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range. The solid opening day returns of 30.8% have left shares trading some 59.8% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.It should be noted that GrubHub is already profitable at the moment, unlike many IPOs these days. Operating at the intersection of technology and food, it has much growth potential ahead, while the merger of the two prominent takeout companies is boosting its competitive position. This is important given the importance of scalability and network effects, which results in a winner-takes-it-all outcome. As a matter of fact, mobile is no issue as well, with 43% of orders in the final quarter of 2013 being placed from a mobile device.Of course, the current valuation is ridiculous based on the current metrics, even as the current run rate of revenues is approaching $200 million per annum and margins are fat. Yet, the valuation is based on the premise of future growth, taking a bigger share of the estimated $70 billion takeout market.If GrubHub could take a nice market share of, let's say 30%, it would see $20 billion of food being processed through its network, resulting in $2.5-$3.0 billion in revenues per annum. On these revenues, very higher margins could be achieved. Yet, this requires years of growth and fencing off competition from yet unknown competitors, as well as guys like OpenTable (OPEN).As such, GrubHub has a lot to prove, and most important will be to continue to show healthy revenue growth, although headline numbers will undoubtedly decline from the reported rates in 2013. As discussed before, these were inflated because of the merger.Obviously, this could go both ways, but for now, I believe the current valuation is high enough to restrain me from jumping onto the bandwagon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This article will discuss the ramifications of the offering, the recent Q2 earnings announcements, and the short and mid-term futures of the company. This article will make the argument that the offering is a net positive to the company, that the ~$50 million raised will create and contribute to immediate accretive opportunities, and that the company remains in the most fundamentally attractive position for share price appreciation since it held its IPO.Who is GrubHub?GRUB operates an online food ordering platform that allows customers to place ""take-out"" orders from a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device. The company works as a broker of sorts between hungry diners and restaurants and facilitates a market like system that brings value to both parties involved. GRUB also operates a corporate program that helps businesses address inefficiencies in food ordering and associated billing.Recent EventsGrubHub, an online food ordering company, recently announced a secondary offering of 10,033,415 shares to be sold to the public. Of the allotment to be sold, 1,250,000 will be offered by the company and 8,783,415 will be offered by selling shareholders. There are 78,831,644 shares outstanding. The offering will dilute current shareholders by 1.5%.The GrubHub Story 1H/14GRUB has been one of the most impressive IPO stories of 2014 and through two quarters the company's stock has done nothing but reflect positive sentiment and improving fundamentals. The shares are up 50.6% from the IPO price and are up 30% (dilution selling from day-one of announcement inclusive) since I got long shares a few days after the IPO. Prior to the offering announcement, the shares had risen to $45.31, up 74% from the IPO and up 50% from my long position initiation. After taking a 20% haircut on the news if anybody has a right to be upset I think I certainly qualify. I'm here to tell you not only am I not upset, I view this offering quite positively and think that this is yet another reason for the Pain Trade that has become GRUB to continue. Now, would I prefer the company had not diluted me 1.5%? Absolutely. But there are quite a few positives that will come from this.First, a discussion of the recent Q2/14 numbers is in order. We'll start with the income statement:As I've said, GRUB has been impressive. I wanted to use a statement that was inclusive of previous full year results to illustrate the track record of excellence with which GRUB operates. I think this is important because to me it really speaks to the competency of management and their ability to drive ROI over time. The core purpose of this article is to address whether the semi-dilutive offering which will only bring ~50 million to the balance sheet can yield share price appreciation long term. I believe a historic look at how management deploys cash and its history of acquisitions and driving earnings helps lend credibility to circumstances such as the one that just crushed the stock. Looking at the substantial top-line growth and the fact that management has managed the company above break-even at these levels of growth speaks for itself. I am confident management can turn this $50 million into new all-time highs in just one half to one full quarter's time.That said, 1H/14 - before we knew an offering was on the horizon, did a good job at giving us a glimpse as to the next stage of evolution for GRUB. First, GRUB maintained its excellent levels of top-line growth with a 125% expansion of revenue that slightly outpaced expense growth which came in at 122% Y/Y for the 1H.There were several important notes to take from the top-line and expense line growth relationship:The Future of GRUBNow, the net income line historically has shown some variance depending on scale up, and how hard GRUB presses advertising (and with that how effective the advertisement is) but looking at the Adjusted EBITDA of GRUB one can clearly see a trend line at 45 degrees to the right - the numbers are getting better year after year in a big way. In fact, Adjusted EBITDA has set records each year sequentially since 2011 and will set a record in FY14 as well. Even if you're not a fan of Adjusted EBITDA, looking at GRUB's reconciliation, there really isn't anything that sticks out as egregious. This is a solid tracking metric and it, like all the other GRUB metrics, looks good.This brings us to the recent offering and how the offering can help accelerate income statement trends based on what GRUB has done during 1H. I've come to the following conclusions, none have been outright stated by management and should be considered complete speculation, about GRUB's short and mid-term initiatives:How does an extra $50 million help any of this and what about me getting diluted?I want to be clear in saying this, GRUB didn't need the cash from the offering and GRUB didn't need to IPO, it had the FCF to go on forever as public company and be just fine. I've said that before and I'll hold that opinion forever.However, GRUB had to IPO for a few reasons that it couldn't deal with on its own. The primary reason was to create a liquid market for its shares. I know that seems obvious but that matters. It matters to top talent software and technology engineers, it matters to top management, and it matters to reserving FCF at the business - remember, share based comp doesn't hurt cash flows, it improves them. Since its IPO, GRUB has seen a flood of top talent show interest in employment and GRUB has taken advantage, hiring over 30 technology engineers in Q2 alone. Why wouldn't the company see a ton of interest, the stock was up 70% inception to date since the IPO. That's an attractive idea to folks getting share based comp.What did this secondary offering display to current and future employees? There is in fact a liquid market for shares and the shares themselves should be worth much more in the future. This secondary offering is a giant neon sign to the best and brightest in the industry to come work for GRUB and I'm fine with that. I have a feeling GRUB's shares will end the quarter at breakeven or higher net of dilution to where I was prior to the announcement. I also have a feeling that this short-term pain will turn into long-term gains as the talent broad on board as a result of my one time dilution (maybe more in the future) pays dividends for the company into perpetuity.Speaking of not needing the cash from the IPO or the secondary, take a look at the cash flows from the last few years and the recent 1H:With CAPEX trending down and operating cash flows trending up, the FCF at GRUB has always been something for me to brag about. In fact, it was my number one reason to buy at the IPO. That said, this cash combined with the cash from the raise leaves GRUB with a Pro Forma $257.8 million shown in the bottom of the income statement graphic above.GRUB also has a history of smart, accretive acquisitions - Seamless being the marquee acquisition. GRUB now has the fire power to accomplish all three of the initiatives I have speculated it wants to accomplish. It can spend to acquire to further its analytical ecosystem should opportunity present itself, it can spend organically to improve that same ecosystem. It can increase spending on S&M and further saturate its target markets with TV and other ads that it now has the money to test - for clarity, it had the cash before as well but I believe GRUB was sitting on its hands (read: cash pile) hoping for an acquisition scenario to present itself. GRUB can also enter new markets at an accelerated speed and scale with the extra funds, something I know it wants to do and is eager to get going. Like I said above, I think GRUB wouldn't mind seeing a dent in the net income line if it means that it can acquire a significant market share (expenses increasing rapidly in advertising to new markets outpacing revenues derived from those new markets). I happen to think the midterm target for market share prior to a scale up is 10% of independent takeout orders or $6.70 billion in gross food sales. GRUB is now better positioned to do all of these and that is not a net negative to me. I don't mind the short-term dilution, which hasn't even been fully priced into the stock as the stock is only down 10% from the announcement, for the long-term reward. Essentially this offering was the shareholders paying for acceleration. Acceleration of everything that GRUB was already going to accomplish in time but the sooner GRUB can take care of its business the more defensible its position gets. I like that being a long-term holder of the stock.Where's the trade?I wanted to end the article with a graphic that illustrates the improvements made at GRUB and to further justify my idea that those long the stock should trust in management and trust the system.GRUB has historically been able to move metrics in a positive way across the board as a result of many different broad-based strategies: acquisition, organic efficiencies, economies of scale, innovation, etc. I like these consistencies to continue.GRUB can also evidence that every dollar spent, at least historically, has always turned into an acceleration of growth. I mean just take a look at the Key Business Metrics table. Active Diners, Daily Average Grubs, and Gross Food sales have all exponentiated since 2011. Really spend some time looking at that table, it is the reason to get long this stock and to stay long.GRUB's recent offering was just that. It was an offering to initiate a position on a man-made dip that doesn't and won't matter long term. It was an offering to get deeper and further DCA into a position if you were a little underweight. It was an offering to cover your short if you've been riding the Pain Trade all the way up from $26 (if you're silly enough to be short this name you probably will ride the short into the abyss but I'll pray that you take good advice and cover).I recommend a long position in GRUB for anybody looking for a growth name in the Technology/Restaurant Derivative space. I look forward to providing continuing coverage.Good luck to all."
2124503,48411,2014-04-04T11:53:10-04:00,GRUB is a rare chance to own a market leader at IPO.GRUB will look to quickly expand its revenues and footprint with acquisitions in the short term.GRUB has found a recipe for monetizing recent societal and behavioral changes.,"Who is GrubHub?GrubHub Inc. (NYSE:GRUB) is the leading online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders. They processed more than 135,000 combined Daily Average Grubs in 2013 and had approximately $1.3 billion of combined Gross Food Sales on their platforms in 2013. They connect local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 600 cities across the United States and are focused on transforming the takeout experience. They operate a software platform that has several variations available for tailoring to local restaurants and large corporations needs.GrubHub Inc. is participating in an IPO on Friday, April 4th, 2014. They are expected to offer 7.03 million shares at between $23-$25 per share. Citi and Morgan Stanley are the main underwriters handling the offering.What do they do and how do they expect to maintain a competitive advantage going forward?GRUB operates a multi strategy software platform that connects hungry diners with local restaurants. They also operate a corporate program that helps businesses address inefficiencies in food ordering and associated billing. Their target market is primarily independent restaurants broken down to local markets.These independent restaurants, which account for 61% of all U.S. restaurants (according to a 2013 industry report prepared by Euromonitor International), remain local, highly fragmented and are mostly owner-operated businesses. According to Euromonitor, Americans spent $204 billion at these approximately 350,000 independent restaurants in 2012. GRUB believes that Americans spent approximately $67 billion on takeout at these independent restaurants, which sums up their interest in essentially running a social network/dating site/toll road that connects people to food and vice versa. GRUB noticed a need, a developing transition to all things mobile, a behavioral change in society, a hugely fragmented market, and an obvious way to become a value add to both parties involved and they have become the market leader in the services they provide.Normally, a description of the target market, the total, and then potentially capturable market is needed to better explain how the company going public expects to remain in business but I think in this case the above are self explanatory. We've all ordered take out, we've all eaten at establishments where we've paid for food, and I don't think the size of the restaurant industry or how the process of ordering food takes place is in question. GRUB hopes to capture a large portion of the local restaurant market in the US and then internationally, which is a simple explanation but I hope is understandable. It's also their simple business model and the obviousness of their necessity as a partner for local restaurants that helps make them a stock with a very bright future but more on that later.GRUB's platform consists of several different products, all that work together to create a well oiled machine. The GrubHub product, the marquee product in the umbrella, consists of a web and mobile based platform that acts as a search engine for local restaurants that diners can use to place online orders instead of calling in directly to the restaurant. The other products in the umbrella are as follows (from the S-1 filing):Seamless Corporate ProgramOn the Seamless Platform, we provide a corporate program that helps businesses address inefficiencies in food ordering and associated billing. Our corporate program offers employees a wide variety of food and ordering options, including options for individual meals, group ordering and catering, as well as proprietary tools that consolidate all food ordering into a single online account that enables companies to proactively manage food spend by automating the enforcement of budgets and rules. Our corporate tools provide consolidated ordering and invoicing, eliminating the need for employee expense reports and therefore significantly reducing administrative overhead relating to office food ordering.Allmenus and MenuPagesAllmenus.com and MenuPages, both of which were acquired in September 2011 by GrubHub Holdings and Seamless North America, LLC, respectively, provide an aggregated database of approximately 275,000 menus from restaurants across all 50 states. The websites are searchable by cuisine type, restaurant name, menu items and other criteria. For those restaurants whose menus are posted on allmenus.com or MenuPages and who are also part of our restaurant network, we provide a link from their menus to our websites, through which diners can then place their orders, providing us with an efficient customer acquisition channel.OrderHub and BoostRestaurants have historically received orders from GrubHub through a facsimile or email and are required to confirm the order over the phone. Though most of our restaurants still use this traditional method, several thousand restaurants use our tablet solutions, OrderHub and Boost. These tools can electronically receive and display orders at the restaurant, providing operators with the capability to acknowledge receipt of the order and update the estimated completion time and status with an easy-to-use application. OrderHub and Boost allow us to monitor orders through the takeout process (receipt, ready for pickup, on the way, etc.). In turn, we can make that information available to hungry diners who are waiting for their orders, thus providing greater transparency, reducing their frustration and making the takeout experience more enjoyable.As shown, GRUB's products work to position them as the one stop shop of takeout ordering. They have managed by organic innovation or by strategic acquisition to create an incredibly efficient and fluid company that allows any single product under the umbrella to depend on the other products to address any needs or shortfalls. They have also set up a business model that makes their services accessible, capital light, and a low risk for their customers. All which has lead to amazing numbers that we'll discuss in detail.As for the actual restaurants, why exactly would they want to utilize the GRUB platform? First things first, orders. One of the biggest reasons that GRUB has experienced the massive growth and use of services that they have is their huge network. Currently, there are just under 30,000 restaurants that participate in the GRUB platform and 3.4 million active diners that participate as customers. That network effect has driven orders, which has driven restaurant participation, which has driven orders, which has driven...you get the point. GRUB's constant, targeted, and maintained growth of their network has accumulated so much momentum that the network effect they are having is the primary catalyst in all things for the company. It's driven a significant drop in cost per customer, increases in revenue, increases in operating margins, increases in overall commission paid by the restaurants participating (without the prompting of GRUB), and it's helped them grow from the inside out (organically, without investing further into the existing network). So the primary reason restaurants want to do business with GRUB is that it's good for business. Again, simple. Second reason, a targeted reach and marketing effort. For most of the restaurants that GRUB partners with, their ideal market is the folks living within a 15-20 minute drive of their location. GRUB's platform isn't designed to market these local restaurants nationally, they market them to the exact diners they would prefer to have, helping deepen diner loyalty and build long term customers for the restaurant. All huge value adds for both parties. Third, service and efficiency. One of the big problems encountered by smaller scale restaurants, and customers, is the problems that arise when trying to place a take out order. We'll all personally encountered these so I'll keep the explanation short but first there's finding an actual menu whether that be in a drawer or online, long hold times calling, a distracted order taker, difficulty actually communicating the order, difficulty specializing the order, inaccuracies in the actual pricing, and so on and so on. It really can be a nightmare. GRUB's platform helps with all of the above. Customer experience matters to a mom and pop shop that may only have one chance to win your business from a large corporation that you ""know"" will have uniform service at each location. This matters. Finally, maybe just as important as the orders themselves, the low risk high reward potential of using GRUB as a partner. GRUB's platform charges no upfront fees, doesn't force the restaurant to dig into their margins with markdowns on food, and can even allow them to increase margins by leveraging their fixed costs. GRUB charges a toll fee to the diner that at least to this point, the diner is happy to pay. The actual restaurants can contact GRUB and proactively pay an upfront fee and give some of the embedded margin spread back to GRUB for priority listing by GRUB's search algorithm if they would like, but it's not required. This is happening by the way. It's happening a lot.What does the diner get? Well, all of the above also are beneficial to the diner. The diner does want an expansive list of options, the diner does want convenience, they do want a more enjoyable experience, and they still want all this at a good value, which they obviously feel they are getting. Outside of those, the diner also benefits from the ability to discover new options in their immediate environment that they often times didn't know existed. Again, all of this feeds into that powerful networking effect that is driving the profit train at GRUB. Both parties wanting the same thing and knowing they can get it.GRUB's competitive advantage lies in their size, network effect, their metrics confirming that an already huge and growing base of recurring users is forming, their product innovation (both organic and through strategic innovation), and in their monetization of mobile devices and behavioral changes. GRUB's analytics have shown that they are increasingly becoming a mobile company, falling in trend with society and recent behavioral changes, and that they have and will continue to effectively monetize the mobile opportunity.GRUB also has several products in their pilot stages, but finished with CAPEX requirements, that they project (I would agree) will help materially contribute to future revenue. As of 12/31/2013, almost all of GRUB's revenue was derived from their GrubHub product. Their other products listed above have not yet started to materially contribute to their earnings, but the company (and I would agree with them) projects that they soon will. I'm particularly interested in the potential of their Allmenu's product, not necessarily what it is but what it can provide the company. What they have done is use the collection of menu's to act as a very cheap lead generator and prospect identifier for business opportunity. They can see what menu's, even out of network menu's, that their markets are searching for and then proactively deploy sales and marketing to that restaurant to capture the business not currently in hand. It's a very innovative and I don't believe priced in potential opportunity that the company will continue to develop. The other product that I think will contribute to the balance sheet on a more short term basis is the OrderHub and Boost products. These could act as a way for competing in-network restaurants to differentiate themselves without making concessions to margins or commissions and also would help improve the customer experience. For GRUB, if they actively promote this strategy line to existing customers (which they have expressed they will do), this will deepen relationships, increase product saturation, improve retention, and create more revenue. All good things to improve the already defensible leadership position they have.Where's the trade?In the last few days GRUB has increased the offering price of their IPO and I think this is because the market is better understanding the opportunity. On the surface, GRUB's business appears to be one with low barrier to entry and one that will eventually devolve into a commodity based business with lower margins and concessions needing to be made. I think all are valid arguments if GRUB was still in the development stage. I don't think of GRUB in those terms as they are already Adjusted EBITDA positive and have shown positive net income the last 3 years. That's not mentioning their huge cash position and the fact that they are the rare IPO that has the current capability to strategically acquire competitors and/or make concessions, if forced, to squeeze their competition to the point of losing a market. The little guys often can't afford to have a ""loss leader"" on the books just to make sure that competition can't penetrate a market, GRUB has the capability. I'm not saying that's part of the ""growth"" strategy going forward, I'm saying it's possible and that's HUGE from a company developing a new industry. Defensible leadership is hard to value but there is obvious value in it that is visible by all. These guys have it.GRUB's balance sheet looks amazing as well. Everything across the board:Pretty amazing. Especially if you look at GRUB's cash, revenue, and Adjusted EBITDA growth compared to total expenses growth. These guys have so much opportunity for growth with declining expenses going forward that I expect all figures to increase in material amounts, sequentially, for the balance of 2014 and probably much further. I really like the idea that management will make developing existing markets the priority for 2014, unless something strategic opens up that absolutely forces their hand, and that the 2014 growth strategy should significantly lower expenses. I think the focus on product saturation (read: no further capex) and the organic growth coming from their existing network can propel this stock much higher in the coming months. I see a huge IPO for these guys and huge run into the balance of the year. The company has zero debt and the shares have a 180 day lockup, which means the buyer of the IPO can afford to let the shares run into what should be a great quarterly announcement. I really like these guys from a standpoint that they are the big player and have competitive balance sheet advantages that others don't. I also like, and this is complete speculation, that if management wants to acquire a sizeable company that they can take on debt to do the acquisition and not have to resort to dilutive measures. These guys have a great track record of making the right buys, at the right time, in the right ways. Management is always something that gets overlooked until you realize the guys running the show shouldn't be. That's not the case here. I like GRUB at IPO and further into the next 12 months for somebody looking for a mid to long term hold. I think if they get a great day one tomorrow that it could eliminate the buying opportunity for short term buyers but that mid and long term buyers can look forward to big things from GrubHub during the balance of 2014. Good luck to all.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Other metrics grew as well:. Daily average grubs (meals) grew 37%. Gross food sales grew 40% to $370 million. Active diners grew 12% after growing 160% for the Sept quarter vs the June quarter.GRUB is priced about the same price-to-sales as Open Table (NASDAQ:OPEN), and is actually is priced at a discount regarding price-to-book and price-to-tangible book value.The market caps are about the same and GRUB's sales growth is higher, as is the P/E.ValuationGlossaryConclusionBuy Grub on the IPO. 43% of the IPO is going to selling shareholders.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.BusinessGRUB is the leading online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders, which it refers to as takeout.GRUB processed more than 135,000 combined Daily Average Grubs in 2013 and had $1.3 billion of combined Gross Food Sales on its platforms in 2013.GRUB connects local restaurants with hungry diners in more than 600 cities across the United States and is focused on transforming the takeout experience.For restaurants, GRUB generates higher margin takeout orders at full menu prices. GRUB's platform empowers diners with a ""direct line"" into the kitchen, avoiding the inefficiencies, inaccuracies and frustrations associated with paper menus and phone orders. GRUB has a powerful two-sided network that creates additional value for both restaurants and diners as it grows.GRUB's target market is primarily independent restaurants.Restaurant marketThese independent restaurants, which account for 61% of all U.S. restaurants (according to Euromonitor), remain local, highly fragmented and are mostly owner-operated family businesses.According to Euromonitor, Americans spent $204 billion at these 350,000 independent restaurants in 2012. GRUB believes that Americans spent $67 billion on takeout at these independent restaurants.For restaurants, takeout enables them to grow their business without adding seating capacity or wait staff. Advertising for takeout, typically done through the distribution of menus to local households or advertisements in local publications, is often inefficient and requires upfront payment with no certainty of success.In contrast, GRUB provides the 28,800 restaurants on its platform (as of December 31, 2013) with an efficient way to generate more takeout orders. GRUB enables restaurants to access local diners at the moment when those diners are hungry and ready to purchase takeout.GRUB only gets paid for orders producedIn addition, GRUB does not charge the restaurants in its network any upfront or subscription fees, GRUB does not require any discounts from their full price menus and it only gets paid for the orders it generates for them, providing restaurants with a low-risk, high-return solution. GRUB charges restaurants a per-order commission that is primarily percentage-based.SeasonalIn metropolitan markets, GRUB generally experiences a relative increase in diner activity from September to April and a relative decrease in diner activity from May to August.In addition, GRUB benefits from increased order volume in campus markets when school is in session and experiences a decrease in order volume when school is not in session, during summer breaks and other vacation periods.Diner activity can also be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which typically increases order volume, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases order volume.Dividend PolicyNo dividends are planned.Intellectual PropertyAs of January 31, 2014, GRUB had more than 40 trademarks registered in the United States, including: ""GrubHub,"" ""happy eating,"" ""Seamless,"" ""OrderHub"" and ""Your food is here.""GRUB also has filed other trademark applications in the United States and abroad and may pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent it believes it will be beneficial and cost-effective.As of January 31, 2014, GRUB had three patents issued in the United States and 15 patent applications pending in the United States, which seeks to cover proprietary inventions relevant to its products and services. GRUB may pursue additional patent protection to the extent it believes it will be beneficial and cost effective.GRUB is the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include the terms ""GrubHub,"" ""Seamless,"" ""Allmenus,"" ""MenuPages"" and certain of its other trademarks and similar variations of such terms.CompetitionGRUB primarily competes with the traditional offline ordering process used by the vast majority of restaurants and diners involving paper menus that restaurants distribute to diners, as well as advertising that restaurants place in local publications to attract diners.For diners, GRUB competes with the traditional ordering process by aggregating restaurant and menu information in one place online, so that it is easier and more convenient to find a desirable restaurant option and place a customized order without having to interact directly with the restaurants.5% stockholdersJ.

2262353,64043,2014-06-10T18:20:25-04:00,Growth is slowing down significantly with a high valuation.Minimal barriers to entry and new competitors getting larger and larger.Significant lockup expiration and other catalysts in the next six months.,"GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) operates in a competitive space of online food transactions. After their merger with Seamless in 2013, they became the biggest player in the space. I think this is an unattractive business model that will be disintermediated overtime and given that the company currently trades at 13x 2014 sales, I am recommending investors short the stock. Below is a summary of the business model and the reasons why I think the stock should be sold short.The company operates a website that allows consumers to order food online from independent restaurants. A consumer orders off the website and provides payment, and then GRUB routes the order to the restaurant, which in turn delivers the food. At the end of the month, the restaurant is paid the money that GRUB collected, minus a commission. The company also acquired Allmenus and Menupages in the past, but these contribute minimally to the company.In my opinion, here are some reasons I don't like the model:1. Growth is slowing down significantly2. No barriers to entry3. No pricing power4. Significant upcoming catalysts that can push the stock lowerThe company's investment bankers were successful in building the hype and getting investors to pay an absurd multiple for shares when the company went public in April, which the sell-side justified given the large addressable market. However, the company is only expected to grow organically 25% in 2015 and is quickly losing its lead due to larger players entering the space. GRUB is reliant on sales and marketing spend in order to increase orders, and although they are profitable, they do not possess the operating leverage that many other fast growing online companies exhibit. GRUB reminds me more of Groupon rather than Yelp, and I believe that the stock can fall by up to 50% as the hype subsides and insiders get out after the lockup.(Lack of) Growth DriversGRUB discloses that its total addressable market is about $67 billion in gross food sales. Given the current commission rates, it comes out to about $9 billion dollars in revenue. Even in the most optimistic scenario, I don't believe GRUB will get anywhere close to this figure.First, this figure is dependent on growing the restaurant base. The company grew from 7,500 to 10,000 restaurant relationships in 2012, and to an estimated 13-14,000 organically in 2014. They ended the year with 29,000 restaurants (the rest through acquisition), but as of their June 4th, 2014 press release, only listed approximately 30,000 restaurants (on the last earnings call in May, they were under 30,000). So for the first five months on 2014, they added ~1,500 restaurants. Extrapolating this over the full year, the company would be growing their restaurant base in the low teens range. Some argument could be made if this will accelerate or decelerate on an absolute basis (being that they already picked the low hanging fruit vs faster technological adoption), but it's safe to say the opportunity in the next 3-5 years is closer to 50,000 restaurants than it is to 100,000, let alone 350,000.So if restaurants aren't growing very fast, how about the orders? It's hard to conclude a meaningful trend because Seamless had a lot more corporate accounts than GrubHub, but from what I can see, the orders are flat to negative. Pre-merger, orders per diner per quarter were falling and order size was flat to slightly up so net, each diner was spending about the same in absolute dollars. Post-merger, there seems to be a meaningful decline in overall sales per customer as GrubHub customers tend to order less frequently. Again, the data is still new and there is seasonality involved, but average revenue per customer is not going up.Something has to be driving GRUB's growth, but it's also not newer markets. I was very surprised on the last call when the CEO said that they are not seeking out new markets. They mentioned that their growth will result from penetrating existing markets, but given the lack of restaurant growth this year, these existing markets may already be saturated.The last factor I can look at is number of diners. GRUB increased the number of diners by 250% last quarter y/y (primarily through acquisition), but only grew revenues 127%. What's more worrisome is that while management states that they are generating significant operating leverage, they are comparing post-merger to pre-merger numbers. Looking closely at the numbers reveals that sales and marketing as a % of revenue has actually increased over the last three quarters. In the last call, management stated that they won't be showing leverage in the sales and marketing line nor the operations line. These are over 50% of total expenses. The only leverage they are getting is G&A and technology, which has already come down significantly and is about a quarter of total expenses. The company is really just buying their subscription base through sales and marketing spend, implying that they aren't seeing significant network effects that exist in other companies such as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). If they really had the great brand and outreach, I would expect revenues to either accelerate or operating margins to decrease across the board.CompetitionGRUB is the largest player in the food delivery space, but it's pretty obvious to most that there are very minimal barriers to entry here. If I just do a quick search on Google, I see:Grubhub/SeamlessEat24Delivery.comFoodlerEatStreetChowNowAlong with various regional/local options as well.GRUB was the first to market and became the clear market leader after merging with Seamless. However, like we've seen from other internet names such as Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), being the first big player in the space doesn't necessarily lead to success.Eat24 is probably the most significant competitor once it partnered with Yelp last year. This is an industry changing partnership that could significantly hurt GRUB. Eat24 mentioned that they were expecting to quadruple in 2013 due to Yelp, and as of July 2013, they had 25,000 restaurants. Eat24 is private, so there is no updated information, but I estimate that Yelp has about 150k total restaurants (based on total business + restaurant review mix), which gives Eat24 a significant runway as well.Delivery.com also partnered with Yelp, but is slightly different because they offer groceries, liquor, and home products as well. Although I haven't gotten performance metrics, it's obvious that Yelp is committed to building out an all in one platform where you can get restaurant reviews, reservations, menus, and ordering, as opposed to GRUB and Opentable (NASDAQ:OPEN), which only fill specific roles.Facebook also recently announced a new menu product that directly competes with GRUB's Allmenus and MenuPages. While this is a small part of GRUB's overall business, it's another bad sign when the really large players begin to build out products using their existing platforms.GRUB estimates that it does 10x more traffic than its next closest competitor, but if I take a look at the website traffic estimates, I think the actual race is a lot closer. GRUB did about 3.8m in visits combined for May (based off trafficestimate.com), while Eat24 (through eat24hours.com) did about 2.6m and Delivery.com had about 900k. I'm not sure if these numbers include the Yelp or not, because an order through Yelp never leaves their website:There is an ""Ordering by Eat24"" at the bottom, but the traffic may not be picked up by one of the internet tracking sites. If the traffic numbers don't include contributions from Yelp, it's reasonable to assume that GRUB has already been surpassed.Another good way to look at traffic is to see how everything is trending. Alexa gives only relative rankings, but the chart paints a good picture.For GrubHub:And Seamless:Eat24 (no secondary chart)As you can see, Eat24hours.com is rapidly growing and has already overtaken the Seamless.com as the most popular single URL. As a side note, Eat24 was able to do this without venture funding, as well as without acquiring other companies.Personally, I believe that the market is also not considering the smaller players in the space. There are numerous regional food delivery companies that could provide a much higher touch solution to local restaurants. Also, many new delivery services are beginning to gain traction, such as Postmates or TaskRabbit, which provide actual delivery services (as opposed to just a transactional portal). If restaurants ever decide to outsource the entire delivery portion out, they would be looking for these types of players in the field that have actual vehicles.Another issue is that I believe that GRUB will face pricing pressure. The company saw an uptick in commission rates in the most recent quarter and most likely this quarter as well because they are shifting Seamless to an auction pricing platform (restaurants bid to be placed higher in search listings). However, management has stated that this is a short term impact, and if I look at the last two years, commission rates have declined from ~15% to 13% pretty quickly. I believe this trend will continue as the market becomes more and more competitive. EatStreet charges restaurants 10% (I don't have data on the other competitors) and I believe that as the industry grows, rates will fall near this level and be closer to parity.Short-term forecastThere were two idiosyncratic events that occurred in Q1 14 that made the company perform above expectations. Most significantly, bad weather gave a large boost to the business as people were more hesitant to leave their homes. While this caused the entire industry to outperform, GRUB benefited more due to their top markets in Chicago and New York. The other impact was the Seamless auction transition that I mentioned before. It's hard to determine the exact revenue impact, but I estimate that they would have done $54.5m for Q1 instead of $58.5m without weather and auction pricing.I'm using sequential numbers primarily because the company has not yet anniversaried the acquisition, so year over year comparisons are not really helpful. I continue this analysis by looking at Q2 and Q3 in the past. In a normalized environment, the summer months will result in negative sequential growth, as school is out and people go out more. I believe that the company will end up closer towards the low end or below guidance for Q2 (and trend the same for Q3), as the overall growth slows and seasonality becomes more prevalent. This is in disagreement with the sell-side, whom expect results at the top end of guidance.Additionally, GRUB is a recent IPO with shares that are locked up until early October. Only 7m shares were sold at the IPO, and so there will be ~71m of shares coming out of lockup. The top two holders of GRUB are private equity funds that will be looking to get out of their investment. I believe that given the significant amount of shares coming out of lockup, there will be significant selling pressure in a few months. We just saw Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) trade a quarter of all its shares on the day of the lockup and fall nearly 20% throughout the day.ValuationWe're halfway through 2014 already, so looking out to 2015, I see an overvalued stock based off a company that is just treading with the rest of the market. The company is currently valued at 10x 2015 Sales, 35x 2015 EBITDA, and 90x 2015 P/E. These are consensus estimates that assume 25% growth in 2015 and 22% growth in 2016, along with significant operating leverage. Management has EBITDA target margins of 35% in the long term, but the sell-side is assuming that GRUB exceeds this by 2017. Even using 2017 numbers, the company is trading at 7.5x sales, 20x EBITDA, and 45x P/E. The company also really only has half the amount of cash on the balance sheet, because there is ~100m of cash owed to restaurants that they haven't paid yet (they pay the restaurants the net sales every 30 days). If I exclude this timing effect, they aren't generating much cash as well. If I look 3 years out, this company is going to be more expensive than FB and TWTR with much slower growth and more competition. Once the hype dies down, I would expect that GRUB trades at a more normalized EBITDA valuation of 15x. At 2014 estimates, GRUB is a $15/share stock, or 60% downside from today's price.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2206203,21791,2014-05-10T08:26:22-04:00,"First-quarter results prove strong growth momentum, but shares overpriced and prone for a pullback.On October 1st, 2014, up to 70,980,172 shares become unlocked and eligible for sale out of a total of approximately 77,635,000 shares opening up a potential wave of heavy selling.Business model is open to potentially fierce competition as local entrepreneurs enter the business of online food order and delivery services.Going public may have been to gain exposure to liquid market for initial investors to cash out.","GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is an online and mobile platform for restaurant pick-up and delivery orders. It recently IPO'd at $26 a share, and began trading on April 4th. On the first day of trading, shares opened up at $40.00, traded as high as 40.80 and closed at the low of the day at $34.00.Source of the IPO data and other data used throughout this article are from its prospectus found here.On May 8th, 2014, GrubHub reported 1st-quarter earnings results of 6 cents per share vs. estimates of 3 cents per share. Revenue was also ahead of expectations, coming in at $58.6 million vs. a $53.42 million estimate.Shares are trading at $33.00 as of the time of this writing.Here is a chart of the share price since GRUB started trading.Some background, GrubHub was founded in 2004 by Matthew Maloney (age 38), the current CEO, and Michael Evans (age 36), who is the current COO but will be leaving by the end of this coming June to pursue other opportunities. They were 28 and 26 years old when the founded the company, respectively.GrubHub went through five rounds of fundraising since its founding, and from the current balance sheet ended March 31st, 2014, a total of $486,782,000 was listed as paid-in capital.Because GrubHub has been a profitable company, it listed retained earnings of $61,233,000 on its balance sheet as of March 31st, 2014. Combined, that makes up the approximate shareholders' equity of $548 million.Mr. Maloney and Mr. Evens have created a wonderful business model in the enterprise they founded.The platform for ordering food is quite brilliant, I believe. That a customer can go to grubhub.com, enter his or her zip code and be made aware of multiple restaurant choices for food delivery or pick is highly convenient.When the customer pre-pays for the food, the driver can simply hand off the food to the paid customer without any delay. This makes delivery drivers highly efficient as well.In essence, ordering food and pre-paying online via the online platform is very efficient, and that increased the productivity of both the restaurant and their drivers as well. Everybody is winning, from the customer to the restaurant to the delivery driver.When GrubHub enters a market, it'll want to sign up as many restaurants as it can. I live near Ithaca, NY. Cornell University is in Ithaca, NY. I can see that I can order food for delivery from 38 restaurants in Ithaca at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday night and pick-up from 42 restaurants via GrubHub's platform. So, 38 of 42 restaurants offer delivery of the food that can be ordered via GrubHub's platform.Restaurants that sign up to be on GrubHub's platform, based on a conversation I had with a manager at one of the restaurants in Ithaca, GrubHub receives 15% of the total order, not including tax, tip and delivery charge.In essence, GrubHub is a 15% coupon for this restaurant to sign up with it and use its platform. That does not sound unreasonable at all.GrubHub reported 1st-quarter revenue of $58.6 million and also noted that gross food sales were $433 million, which makes its revenue 13.53% of gross food sales. So the revenue grab of food sales should be looked at as 13.53% in the aggregate.GrubHub should be noted as being just the platform for ordering food, and not the actual deliverer of the food.Potentially Fierce CompetitionThis is where another local business in Ithaca, NY comes in. Founded just 3 years ago, a company called Ithaca-To-Go makes for a perfect example of the competition a company like GrubHub faces in densely populated cities it operates in. Local entrepreneurs, like Vanessa Isaacs, who started Ithaca-To-Go 3 years ago with just 5 restaurants signed up, now has 40, which is about the same amount as GrubHub. Ithaca-To-Go is an online food ordering platform, just like GrubHub, but Ithaca-To-Go has its own drivers that deliver the food. That's the big difference!So long that the entrepreneurial spirit is strong in America, competition from companies starting up like Ithaca-To-Go may well prove to become fierce competition for GrubHub, which does not offer delivery drivers, but just the online ordering platform.That's a big question mark in the model going forward. Should restaurants want to simply outsource both the online ordering and delivery drivers, GrubHub's model won't work, because it doesn't have drivers. Business models like Ithaca-To-Go's will be the platforms that work in that regard.The important point to note is that any restaurant can be on multiple platforms, and hence, that's going to dilute revenue for each platform as more and more platforms go online. Many restaurants in Ithaca use both the Ithaca-To-Go and GrubHub platforms.Going Public To Simply Access Markets To Sell SharesAfter the IPO of 4 million shares that sold for $26 a share, gross proceeds after fees and expenses were $95.5 million.In the prospectus for the offering, GrubHub noted that the use of the proceeds would be as follows:This more or less tells me that the point of going public was to simply gain exposure to liquid markets for initial investors. Again, it went through 5 rounds of fundraising and has a total of $486 million in paid-in capital. Thus, the need for raising capital to fund operations is not there, and nor was there a need to raise funds in the capital markets at the time of the IPO to make a specific acquisition.This is why I'd be wary of the date October 1st, 2014, approximately 181 days after the initial public offering on April 4th, at which time the lock-up period ends. There could very well be a wave of selling.The current market price of $33.00 a share and an estimated share count post the IPO of 78,385,786 makes the current market capitalization of $2.586 billion. That's at least 5x as much as the initial paid-in capital of $486 million listed on the balance sheet. Clearly a high reward for backing a wonderful business model. Of course, it depends on who invested how much and when.I don't believe GrubHub is worth $2.586 billion.Aggregate revenue for GrubHub can grow 20% per year, as per average analyst estimates. This is simply on account of market expansion, which is very likely and will probably be exceeded.This recent quarter showed us tremendous improvement in the expense of sales and marketing as a percent of revenue. This is based on combined revenue of any mergers, to give a more accurate compare.Net income came in at 7.43%.Revenue for 2014 is expected to be $221 million before today's earnings results. They'll likely get bumped up to $230 million or so. From $230 million, growing 20% a year, in 5 years time by fiscal year 2019, revenue can be around $572 million, and at a net profit margin of 8% per year, 2019 earnings could be $45.78 million.So even in 2019, or 5 full years from today, if the same number of shares are outstanding, earnings of $45.78 million is just 58 cents per share. At $33.00 a share, the P/E is 57.GrubHub most definitely needs to grow its net profit margins far higher than 8%, and/or needs to grow revenue faster than 20% per year to justify its current $2.58 billion market cap.With this said, I expect see shares of GrubHub fall in anticipation of the unlocking period on October 1st, where close to 71 million shares out of the total 78 million outstanding become eligible for sale. At the same time, investors should allow for a few more quarters of earnings results to gauge this business model's margin capacity.I believe shares can quite easily drift down to $20 before the end of the year, which is a decline of 40% from $33 a share. Longer term, GrubHub is early in the game and can prove to become the dominant player in a business model that is what the future calls for: Online food ordering platforms.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2291173,48411,2014-06-29T21:53:02-04:00,One look at GRUB's cash flow statements and you will be ready to order in some shares.GRUB's existing portfolio of penetrated markets should be reaching a level of maturation now or soon that will drive margins and efficiency.GRUB benefited from the harsh winter and should benefit from higher petroleum and food costs in Q2/Q3.,"When I first came across the GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) opportunity in early April I was a little shocked this company was going public. I mean, I just didn't see the need for a company generating absurd levels of cash flow, that had no anchoring debt obligations or interest expense that it needed new investors to subsidize, and that was showing growth across the board at exponential levels to open itself up to the challenges that come with being a public company. I saw this company as one of the best fundamental IPO's of the year, quite possibly the last few years, and was bullish the name from the outset. That bullishness has only grown stronger and more resolved after the company's first quarter results. This continuing coverage article will discuss the high visibility of long-term viability and success of GRUB based on the cash flow generation of the company, the chronological developments of markets in aggregate and the improvements within those markets with extended duration, and overall dynamics of the markets GRUB serves.A Brief HistoryIf you are unfamiliar with the business of GRUB I would recommend reading any number of the articles tethered to the ticker at SA. This article will not discuss in detail what GRUB does outside of the underlying operations affecting the financials being reported. I highly recommend reading the reports prepared by Don Dion and Jason Tillberg for a bullish and bearish comparison.Historically speaking, GRUB has been an absolute gem. We'll start with by taking a look at operations for the last three full years:The income statement at GRUB doesn't tell the full story but even knowing that, which we'll explain later, the income statement is more than acceptable for a young company. Showing profitability dating as far back as FY2011, although it appears becoming less profitable, is something that surely contributed to the frothy IPO demand that GRUB experienced in April. Top-line growth has been excellent, posting growth of 35.7% FY11-FY12 and 66.6% FY12-FY13.This level of growth can be attributed to two factors. The first being that GRUB has increased its operating expenses in an effort to drive growth on a consistent FY basis, increasing them 45.3% FY11-FY12 and 66.2% FY12-FY13. Naturally, as a result of those increased expenses you would expect the top-line to grow as well and it has, which is positive.Second, there exists some level of organic expansion of the top-line from previous new markets (expenses to enter into these new markets were reflected in the prior year) as the newly entered markets mature. GRUB has a well-developed history of showing increases in all performance metrics in markets, regardless of size or geographical location, as the market matures. The company has not provided specificity on this progression, but assures the analyst community that it has the analytics to prove this statistical trend beyond doubt. The progression has been seen in all GRUB's grouped markets including and dating back to its original markets of Chicago and New York City.This particular regularity becomes important to note and remember when considering a long position in GRUB because it further underlines one key fact: that GRUB is never less efficient on a cost adjusted basis than just after entry into new markets, with the inefficiency decreasing as duration increases. That being said, GRUB is a relatively young company with most of its development taking place beginning in late 2010. It would stand to reason, and management said as much on the GRUB Q1/14 earnings call, that efficiency and margins would improve in existing markets going forward and on a companywide basis in proportion to the amount of new markets (driving efficiency and margins down) entered and existing markets maturing (offsetting new market decreases in efficiency and margin contraction). GRUB does not plan to enter into any new markets for the balance of 2014 or in 2015. This to me is the second largest reason to own GRUB over the next 24 months if considering a long position, to take advantage of the aggregate maturation of the markets within the GRUB portfolio and the above said benefits.Now, when comparing those two FY growth increases on a percentage basis one could conclude, and some have in the comments sections of my previous article, that the top-line is growing slower than expenses - which still wouldn't be the end of the world for a company of this maturity but regardless, that is not entirely true. Both non-cash stock-based compensation, which is spread across several line items within total expenses (important), and dividends on preferred stock are not true expenses of the underlying business and both have been remedied as of the IPO or eliminated entirely. For clarity, GRUB paid dividends on its preferred stock from 2011-2013 but plans to retain all earnings for the foreseeable future, as all preferred stock was converted just prior to the IPO. This line item will have no further effect on the financials going forward. The stock based expense, while real and important, I am not willing to price into the profitability of the company. It has nothing to do with the actual operations at the company and the ""expense"" of it will vary with the performance of the actual share price because the GAAP requires that performance based equity awards be marked to market, meaning a better share price performance will equal a higher expense. That being said, for me, I don't punish a company for its share price doing what I would hope it would do.Finally, take into account a $13 million swing in provision for income taxes over the last three years, which significantly hit the bottom line, and you have a very solid 36 months of operations. I have no complaints and see no line items historically that would be indicative of any issues that may pop-up in the future.Cash flow at the company has been far more impressive:This is one of the cleanest cash flow statements I have ever seen. Operationally GRUB is exceptional. Not a single line item is unusual. No large amounts of deferred taxes, no unearned revenues, and no spikes in accounts payable (relative to the net) to skew the amount of cash being provided by operations. Quite to the contrary actually: GRUB showed a large negative growth in the total accounts receivable (a good thing) which means that the positive cash flow from FY13 that was not taken in has to come presumably in FY14, which should provide some padding to the upside for the year. This is real cash flow we're talking about here, not made up accounting cash that composes the net income number. This is actual dollars being made by the underlying business which is hugely profitable, obviously. Cash from operations has a positive slope-line and has grown 27% over the last three full years, something that is not easy to do and that is not usual of companies in this stage of development.Moving on from the operational level, the company carried out normal investments into the growth of the business via CAPEX and acquisitions as well. Outside of some notes receivables transactions that balanced out between FY11-FY12, which had no net effect on cash flow on the two year basis and were one-time in nature, there were no unusual additions to the net cash flow from investments. Actual CAPEX did fluctuate but at a three year average run-rate of $4.75 million I'm confident that the growth from CAPEX will remain relatively constant (driving top-line growth) in FY14. This sentiment is also reflected by management in full year guidance which will be discussed later.A few pieces are important to note here historically and with more recent relevance: first, GRUB did acquire ~$13 million in cash from acquisition in 2013 which skewed net cash from investing activities to the positive for the year. That said, that cash came from the company's own good due diligence in which they came across that nest egg so I'm leaving it in place when providing the average cash flow provided from this section. When thinking in terms of the above mentioned average CAPEX run-rate, management did mention on the Q1/14 earnings call that they expect a slightly higher rate of CAPEX in FY14 than usual. Finally, removing the notes receivables transactions (in an effort to give a more accurate picture of net cash flows) net cash flows would have been ~ -$20 million in FY11, ~-$6 million in FY12, and ~$7 million in FY13 (~-$1 million removing the cash provided from acquisition which was one-time and non-recurring). Looking at it from this perspective, free from abnormal activities, we can see that what appeared to be a large draw down on cash is actual trending positively or breakeven at worst on a three year basis.Cash flow from financing historically has been littered with abnormalities as well. Just about every line item on a three year basis will no longer be reflected going forward with emphasis being on the distributions to shareholders and the buybacks. Outside of the proceeds from the IPO, these sections should be relatively flat during the next quarter when the IPO is reflected. The one thing an investor can take from this portion is that outside of FY11 the net change in C&CE wasn't heavily influenced one direction or the other from this portion, so our FY net change doesn't need to be adjusted to get an accurate figure.The actual cash flows provided have been nothing short of incredible: ~$2.5 million in FY11, ~$37.6 million in FY12, and ~$45.2 million in FY13. That type of cash flow allows GRUB the flexibility to do just about anything they want from a growth strategy standpoint and insures those long the stock that a debt raise and/or an equity raise should be out of the question. Those levels of C&CE also will turn heads from an acquisition standpoint. The acquisition of OPEN will have some speculating about potential suitors here as well, and should help to drive borrowing costs down if GRUB wants to acquire another company but use debt for acquisition - which is not at all the same thing as using debt for working capital.All factors considered, the historic and recent cash flows at GRUB are for me the biggest risk to the bear thesis that's circulating that GRUB is ""over-valued"" because of its P/E, price to revenues, price to trailing sales, etc. Everybody bearish, at least from what I've read, is spending too much time looking at the income statement and not the cash generation, which is fine because they'll either be chasing the stock down the road or getting pancaked on the short side (more on this later).The recent income statement and cash flows are more of the same, which is a good thing:GRUB showed big improvements in net income growth Y/Y, partially driven by the harsh winter domestically which GRUB believes was a one-time tailwind that drove orders, even in the face of large upticks in expenses. GRUB is scaling up what they were already doing well and this has secondary and tertiary benefits that we'll break down shortly. The Q1 income statement speaks for itself. One thing to keep in mind here, notice the absence of the dividends on preferred stock line - that should help to provide a bit of padding on a quarterly and FY basis.The cash flow statement mirrors what it has historically with a few changes. GRUB did show a marked increase in deferred income taxes, which skews operational cash flows to the positive, but that was largely offset by the one-time item increase in stock based compensation. We still see a healthy accounts receivable deficit and in Q1 we saw a decrease in accounts payable - both of these reflect an indication that we're getting as close to a true representation of cash from as possible with the added bonus of accounts receivable cash flow padding to come down the road. All told, cash flow from operations put on a smoke show Y/Y and the number was legitimate.The investing activities and financing activities were in-line with historical norms and showed no abnormalities which mean no adjustments made for an accurate picture of net change in C&CE. Also, for clarity, this is how these two lines should look going forward - very vanilla with none of the silliness that cluttered these areas before. Net increase in C&CE more than doubled Y/Y (which speaks to the scaling- up of the company) putting GRUB well on pace to set all-time marks for cash flow. GRUB should generate cash of ~$100 million in FY14 by my models which are bullish leaning but I don't think they are unrealistic in the least. For clarity, my cash flow figure does not include cash provided by the IPO.Where are we today? Is there still room in this trade?GRUB gave the following Q2 guidance on its Q1 conference call:I'm more bullish than management is for Q2 and have modeled GRUB to hit a revenue mark of $56-$57 million, which would put them on pace with revenue during Q1. If they can hit this number, and I think they will, they stock would react very positively as that would skew many of the models on The Street - which already happened Q1 (at least for the analysts on the Q1 call who admitted as much). I'm expecting GRUB's existing markets to produce at slightly higher rates than management is as a result of higher average Q2 petroleum costs driving down seasonal travel (more people at home for a duration of time not currently modeled) and as a result of food costs in aggregate being up 23% YTD (SOURCE: CRB Food Index), putting restaurant order costs closer in-line with the cost of eating home cooked meals. These may seem like reaches, but I think they will move the needle.In conclusion, I don't think the GRUB trade is crowded at this point and I think the stock is sitting in the range of $37-$38/share range by Q2 earnings. That's roughly a 10% increase from today's close at $34.20. While the majority of that move would be technically based, I do think there will be a few banks that come to the upgrade table prior to the Q2 announcement.I like the shares here on all durations and think that the bear cases made based on ""value"" are half-baked and not relevant for the frothy markets we are in or the future cash flow generation potential at GRUB. I especially pay no mind to the ""there are no barriers to entry"" argument as GRUB has the first to market advantage and for a select few opportunities, this one included, barrier to entry are not important. The barriers to entry for becoming a search engine are incredibly low when compared to the potential top-end opportunity and I rarely see that argument being made by Google bears. The bear cases to date have been lazy and they've been wrong. Now, if we see an absolute market collapse on something fundamental (not likely) GRUB could get swept down in some negative beta, but outside of that happening I think GRUB continues to be a pain trade for anybody unlucky enough to be short.I really think GRUB is a great long-term opportunity for the growth investor looking for some downside protection to come from cash flow at the company. GRUB stands to get more and more efficient as its portfolio matures and it should be able to drive margins over the long haul as they have historically. Q1 showed the Y/Y trend of incremental improvements in tact:GRUB showed improvements in every major line item that matters, including total expenses, net income, and adjusted EBITDA.I look forward to tracking GRUB's progress throughout the year and into the future and will be providing updates periodically. As always, good luck to all.Disclosure: The author is long GRUB. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2124513,21820,2014-04-03T11:54:57-04:00,Full integration of Seamless and GrubHub merger creating strong market leader.Huge opportunity in highly fragmented market with current base of 600 U.S. cities.Potential for international expansion via acquisitions.,"Later this week when GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) hits the open market with an initial price offering (S-1), investors will likely pour into this growth company. Unfortunately, due to high demand and a small chunk of the overall company, shares will likely soar to unattainable levels. The result could see early shareholders get burned as the stock falls and IPO buyers cash out. Despite this likely scenario, I believe investors should try and get in on the IPO from their broker or wait for several weeks and buy into this growing story.GrubHub is offering over 7 million shares in its IPO. Four million come from the company itself, with an additional three million coming from existing shareholders. After setting an initial pricing range of $20 to $22, the company has raised that level to the $23 to $25 range and is reportedly seeing strong demand.GrubHub is the resulting company from a merger between Seamless and GrubHub in August of 2013 that created the leading online and mobile platform for ordering food. The company is ""connecting hungry diners with local restaurants across the country."" The company's targeted market is independent restaurants, which represent 61% of the United States market. By utilizing GrubHub, small restaurants gain an instant online and mobile presence with no upfront costs. In fact, one of the company's key market opportunities is listed as ""large and fragmented market.""The company's key competitive advantages from the filing:· Market leader· Powerful two-sided network effect· Growing and recurring diner base· Product innovation· Mobile engagement and monetization· Attractive business modelGrubHub's growth strategy:· Grow our two-sided network· Enhance our platform· Deliver excellent customer service· Pursue strategic acquisitionsIn 2013, GrubHub had 135,000 daily average Grubs, or what it considers members. The company was responsible for $1.3 billion in gross food sales during the 2013 year. As of December 31st, the company had 28,800 restaurants on its platform.There is plenty of room for expansion for GrubHub, which is one of the biggest reason I believe investors should get in after the subsequent fall of the stock. The company has a presence in 600 U.S. cities and London. There is room for many new cities and the addition of restaurants within existing cities.Another key area of growth for GrubHub is mobile utilization. Back in 2011, when both GrubHub and Seamless were beginning entry into mobile with dedicated applications, mobile sales represented only 20% of total sales. Now in 2013, that number has grown to 43%.In 2013, GrubHub reported revenue of $137.1 million, an increase of 67%. Net income was $6.7 million for the full year. These numbers were powered by growth in cities, restaurants, and customers, with the combination of the two companies integrated together. Here is a look at recent financials and key figures:Revenue continues to climb and in 2013, the company saw quarterly increases. Here is a look at all four quarters from 2013.After the IPO, GrubHub will have over 78 million shares outstanding. With around 7 million shares being sold, less than 10% of the company's shares will be available on the open market. This will create strong demand with limited supply. I would not be surprised to see shares hit the $40 level on their first day of trading. This is the reason why I recommend getting in early on the IPO. With that being said, I believe investors will take profits and sell shares within the first week. I would be a buyer at around the $25 to $30 range for the long-term opportunity both in the United States and international markets, likely via acquisitions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GRUB over the next 72 hours.

We penned that piece when shares were trading around the $7.30 mark and debated whether we wanted to take on this momentum trade or not. As the technical chart shows below, shares went on a significant bull run during the past 12 months. Share price gains have recently come to a halt though despite some encouraging numbers in the recent fourth quarter as well as 2019 as a whole. The question now is whether the stock can get its mojo back. We clearly are dealing with an excellently run firm here.For example, Robert Alpert (the newly appointed CEO) was upbeat on the recently announced fourth-quarter and 2019 annual numbers. The successful fiscal year was really cemented by the fact that management declared a whopping $3.35 special dividend at the back end of the year. Considering that shares are currently trading at $8.89 per share, that special dividend really exemplified how strongly operations are being run at present.Top-line sales hit $3.6 million in the fourth quarter, which meant 2019 sales rose to $40.3 million. Top-line growth actually slowed below average in Q4 (13%) as full-year sales grew by 17% in 2019.The real story though was GlobalSCAPE's growth in net profit in 2019. Net profit came in at a whopping $13.3 million compared to $3.7 million in the previous year. Management was quick to cite that net profit would have been even bigger if costs (such as the dividend and employee bonus) were taken out of the equation.Suffice it to say, this massive growth in net profit (as well as recent sluggish share price action) has brought down the reported price to earnings ratio to just above the 13 mark. For a company growing this fast, this earnings multiple looks really attractive on the surface. Is there more to meet the eye here? Let's discuss.Companies growing their sales at almost a 20% clip will always attract attention especially if earnings are pretty cheap. The managed file transfer industry is obviously a hot sector right now and GlobalSCAPE is taking full advantage.The question is how long it will stay this way. Our concern would be if earnings were to drop from this level (perfectly feasible given the run-up). For example, annual net profit dropped multiple times this decade, primarily in 2012, 2014, 2016 as well as 2017. Yes, the underlying trend has been upward (confirmed by 2019 numbers), but the market doesn't seem convinced at this stage that this type of growth will continue.The issue we would have with respect to buying GlobalSCAPE at its current earnings multiple is that we have already seen how volatile the firm's earnings can be. Just two short years ago remember, the firm reported only $1.4 million in net profit.Therefore, we see this volatility, we like to specifically turn to the sales multiple as well as the book multiple to see if the firm's sales and assets are as cheap as the firm's earnings. Why? Because assets and sales don't tend to be as volatile as earnings. Suffice it to say, when we see companies with low assets, sales and earnings, we always double down on our research.GlobalSCAPE shares are presently trading with a book multiple of 8.4 and a sales multiple of 3.95. These numbers are well ahead of the averages in this sector (3.28 and 2.75) as well as GlobalSCAPE's five-year averages (4.44 and 3.00) respectively.Suffice it to say, when a company has a low P/E (relative to its averages) and high P/S, it could potentially mean that all we have seen is a temporary boost in profit margins. We state this because sales increased by 17% in 2019 whereas earnings increased by 259%. Management stated in the fourth-quarter announcement that the firm is well positioned for more growth in 2020. The first quarter should give us some insights on how much growth there really will be this year.To sum up, GlobalSCAPE announced an impressive set of numbers in the fourth quarter which resulted in a bumper 2019 for the firm. The jury though is still out in this company with respect to future growth. Earnings may look cheap at present but the firm's sales and assets are priced well above the sector's averages at present. Let's see what the first quarter brings."
4295518,105275,2019-10-07T20:39:02-04:00,"GlobalSCAPE’s new management took some bold actions in 2018 to create shareholder value, and the stock is up ~3x as a result.Growth has increased despite a huge decrease in operating expenses and substantial margin improvement.The stock is still cheap around <13x projected 2019 FCF.","GlobalSCAPE (GSB) is a small, undervalued player in the managed file transfer (MFT) market. The company has executed perfectly on their goals since new management has taken over, which is why the stock has run-up in price over the last year. They have a solid niche product with a very sticky customer base, a newly aligned cost structure and high free cash flow generation. They've learned from the mistakes of the previous management team and refocused on the main product, which has improved the business dramatically. These factors, combined with an excellent capital allocator at the helm, make GSB a great investment at current levels. GSB is one of the only pure MFT companies, as many larger software companies offer the service as one of many enterprise software solutions. MFT is software that allows companies to share data in a safer and cheaper way than the typical file transfer protocols, and provides an interface which makes their data easily accessible in one place. MFT services have been around for a while, however the market has been shifting from on premise software to cloud services, as cloud offerings have improved in recent years. Despite the shift in the larger market, GlobalSCAPE still primarily sells on premise software through one time licenses, and charges 20-30% of the initial licensing cost as an annual maintenance service, which most customers buy. This creates a subscription-like model with a large initial cash payment.GSB has undergone some serious changes in the last year, after an investigation that ultimately showed that a former employee had improperly recognized revenue to inflate sales numbers. The changes made in the last year, however, have created substantial shareholder value and positioned the company well for the future. Last August, Robert Alpert and Clark Webb were added to the board, and Alpert assumed the position of chairman after they both purchased substantial stakes in the company. Alpert runs an investment fund and is involved in several other businesses, but has also assumed the role of CEO for GSB after incumbent Matthew Goulet passed away earlier this year. Last August, the company changed its strategy with their new Chairman. They explained this in the most recent shareholder letter, and the strategy mostly revolved around refocusing on their core EFT(enhanced file transfer) platform and shrinking their operating costs significantly. They also took a bold approach to both capital allocation and cost structure, laying off a significant portion of their employees to lower operating expenses, and repurchasing 19% of outstanding shares in a tender offer last year. They also paid a $.50 special dividend earlier this year, which represents over $30m returned to shareholders in about a year.In the first half of 2019, opex has fallen ~33% compared to 2018. Since Alpert took over in June of 2018, the stock is up around 3x. Let’s take a closer look at the effects of the changes they made.They went from 54 to 43 sales and marketing employees, and also decreased from 27 engineering employees to 9. The following explanation is from the most recent 10-Q: Before Alpert took over the company had tried to expand into a product called Kenetix, which provided an “integration platform as a service” for business to use all of their cloud applications, databases, and tools on one platform. For whatever reason, this was not working well and the product never took off. The new plan has produced great results, granted it has only been about a year. Instead of trying to force the cloud SaaS offering on customers, or expand into new products, they’ve continued pushing MFT licenses and focusing on renewals of M&S(maintenance and support) contracts, which are the only recurring portion of their revenue. This led to a 12% increase in new licenses, and a 22% increase in M&S revenues in the first half of 2019, even after significantly reducing their sales and marketing expenses. It’s worth noting that some of that growth is due to M&S price increases. We’ll have to wait longer to see if the higher prices result in less renewals over time, but as of now it hasn’t happened. This is dependent on how strong the company’s moat, or competitive advantage is.As with many software companies, GlobalScape has a sticky product which allows them to be able to raise prices slowly and retain customers. While many software moats are strong due to the SaaS model, GlobalScape primarily has customers that buy a license and pay a yearly maintenance and support fee. The moat around this business model can be just as strong, if not stronger than the subscription model. While it may be tougher to attract new customers with the large upfront expenses, the licensing model is better for customer retention. When customers buy that license, they’re basically anchored to Globalscape’s software, unless they’d prefer to go without MFT altogether or pay again for a different MFT product. At that point, they have to decide whether or not maintenance and support, which also includes any updates they make to the software, is worth the yearly fee. The company claims that a large majority of customers renew, and this makes sense because data safety is a really sensitive issue that can be a huge headache for companies. Said otherwise, making sure that they can reach a customer service rep at any time, and that they have constant access to updates, seems critically important to any company that deemed their data to be sensitive and important enough to even buy MFT in the first place. In addition, the on premise option often requires companies to make investments in additional hardware/infrastructure to support the on premise software, so they are even more anchored to the license they purchased. These aren’t very unique observations, but in a world where software companies are switching to SaaS more and more, it’s worth observing the merits of the licensing model.Why is it that GlobalScape seems to be bringing in more perpetual licenses while the SaaS offering, EFT Arcus, hasn’t taken off? First, it stands to reason that they view EFT as a long term investment in their company infrastructure. Companies would be more hesitant to make a large upfront investment if they wanted the flexibility to leave for a competing product, in which case SaaS would make much more sense. It would not be a more economic decision to purchase an upfront license with a maintenance fee unless you planned on staying with that product for a sufficient time period for the total cost of ownership to be lower. This makes me believe that GlobalScape’s customers are recognizing the quality and utility of the product, and feel that they will use it over a long time period, further proving that they do indeed have a moat around their current level of M&S revenues.While many companies are trying to move to only subscription offerings, customers who prefer the cloud can still purchase the license offering through GlobalScape. They allow customers to purchase their one time licenses and deploy them in the cloud, which is called BYOL(bring your own license). GlobalScape has a nice niche product that can be offered in either environment, or as a hybrid of on premises and cloud. The benefits of having several options are that the product appeals to a wide range of companies with very different needs and preferences. For instance, many of their customers deal with sensitive medical or personal data about customers and employees, and an on premise MFT product makes more sense because they’re becoming more and more worried about data safety. Many companies need to be compliant with HIPAA or other data protection standards and transferring large chunks of data through other file transfer protocols is not only much more risky, it’s tedious and more expensive in the long run.The utility of their product and quality of GlobalScape’s customer service are evident through a quick internet search, where the large majority of reviews are positive and praise both the product and their support team, and rankings of MFT services consistently list them near the top. New management did reduce the number of customer service employees by 4, but they haven’t stopped focusing on providing excellent customer service. In their shareholder letter, they cited a customer satisfaction rating of 94%, and an NPS (net promoter score) rating of 75, which is considered “world class.”(2018 Annual Report) The combination of all of these factors gives GlobalScape a solid moat around their current level of business, and should give them the ability to slowly raise prices over time.Since we’ve established that GlobalScape has a solid moat around their current run rate of business, at least in the M&S category(~65%), let’s look at their growth prospects. They obviously weren’t growing enough to justify their past level of investment in sales & marketing. Growth comes primarily in the form of new licenses, which are recorded as revenue in the year purchased, and also increase their M&S revenues over time as new licensees purchase M&S. As we’ve noted, software companies often have switching costs which make their product very sticky, so it is unlikely that GlobalScape will poach customers who’ve already chosen a different MFT option. Their growth will have to come through customers new to the market, and if they can improve renewal rates, M&S should grow at a faster clip over time.M&S growth can also be driven by upselling, which seems to be part of the strategy. The recent 10-Q mentions “expansion within the current customer base” as a key reason for license growth this year. This would mostly mean pushing extra features added onto the core EFT product, improving renewal rates to drive M&S growth over time, and upgrading customers to the Platinum M&S contract, which offers 24/7 service. Focusing their efforts here has worked so far, and time will tell if they can continue to grow within their current customer base.GSB’s growth will also be largely impacted by the growth of the MFT market as a whole. They captured about $38m of revenue in 2018, which was about 3.3% of the global MFT software and service market. The market is expected to grow at a 6.9% CAGR until 2025 (Global Newswire). It’s not surprising to note that GSB is a relatively small player in this market. It’s a very competitive market with lots of players, big and small. While some would argue that they won’t be able to keep up with the larger players, especially under a smaller marketing budget, I believe their renewed focus on the core EFT platform gives them an advantage over others. It may seem like they’ve decreased their investment in new customer acquisition, but it’s quite possible that since they’ve stopped trying to market all of their other products, EFT is actually being marketed more now than ever.Huge companies like Oracle or IBM have MFT products, and will likely capture the largest customers that use their other software products. MFT is not by any means a new product, though, so most huge companies who need MFT already have it. The growth in MFT is about making small and medium sized companies aware of the product, and emphasizing its importance, which GlobalScape is in a prime position to do as a small, pure play MFT company. They have a strong internet presence for such a small company, with tons of informational marketing material on their website. They’re ranked a top 5 MFT product by G2 & addictive tips, which are the top results for the google search “best mft product.” With that in mind, and sales efforts more focused on the core EFT product, the company is in a prime position to capture lots of new business as the market grows.An interesting change that largely flew under the radar was the fact that during their layoffs, they actually increased their professional services employees from 5 to 6, and professional services revenue has increased from $.9m to $1.53 year over year in the first half of 2019. Professional services include help with implementation, automation, training, and more for their customers. This fits with the strategy of marketing to smaller companies which would need help setting up the product, and it appears to be working to this point. In the same period new licenses grew from $4.9m last year to $5.5m. In addition, M&S revenues grew 22% year over year due to higher renewal rates and a price increase. It is clear that they are much more focused on their core EFT product, improving the customer experience, and marketing to the right customers, and the results have already been reflected in the company’s financials.In addition to those realizations, the company also seems to have realized they have a moat, as evidenced by the recent price increases. I expect to see gradual price increases for M&S over time. The combination of those factors gives me confidence in their growth prospects moving forward. It’s hard to say if we’ll see continue to see the level of revenue growth as this year so far, but around 10% or more should be very achievable for the longer term future. The company’s costs are more fixed than variable, so free cash flow should grow faster than revenue.GlobalScape currently trades around $11.65 per share, or about a $200m market cap. Since they’ve undergone such dramatic changes in the last year, the first 6 months of 2019 are the best representation of the current state of the business. They generated ~$20m in revenue with an 85% gross margin and a 39% operating margin. After adjusting for the accelerated vesting of stock options for their late CEO, it would’ve been about 42%, or $8.2m. The beauty of this business is that they made all of that and more in cash, generating about $10.2m in operating cash flow, with only <$500k in capital expenditures. Before changes in working capital, operating cash flow would’ve been $8.3m.It’s nice that they can collect cash upfront for M&S contracts, but we can only expect FCF to outpace net income in periods which the amount of new licenses & M&S contract values exceed recognition of revenue for contracts already paid for. Therefore, free cash flow exceeding net income is a pretty good indication of the ongoing health of the business, and provides the company with cash to deploy quicker than their accounting earnings would indicate. While ideally the business' positive momentum continues, and FCF outpaces net income, we should look at normalized cash flows for valuation purposes. In this case, we can define that as cash flows before changes in working capital.Full year normalized operating cash flow at this point for the business would be about $16.5m. With $1m of capex per year, the company can generate about $15.5m in annual free cash flow in its current form. Although margins are already extremely high, they don’t have many costs that vary heavily with revenue, so they will have continuing operating leverage as they grow. We’ve also seen that the current management team has no tolerance for unnecessary expenses, which is always a good sign. At <13x expected 2019 normalized free cash flow, and no debt on the balance sheet, the stock is inexpensive. It doesn’t necessarily deserve the ultra high multiples that many SaaS businesses get, because those companies invest much heavier in customer acquisition and their revenue is spread out over subscription terms, as opposed to received via upfront license fees. It is, however, attractive at current levels because the underlying business is very stable and durable, providing a margin of safety, and the potential for sustained growth with little capital investment and minimal cost is there. The company was investigated and it was found that the misreported revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company described the incident as the following:(Source: 2018 Company Statement)The company has since settled a class action lawsuit brought on by shareholders, and the CFO at the time has since retired. As stated earlier, the company brought on new Chairman Robert Alpert last year, and the CEO at the time passed away earlier this year, so Alpert is also serving as the current CEO. This is obviously a black mark on the company’s history, but it is indicative of the mismanagement that was happening under the previous leadership. I don’t worry about this sort of thing in the future, considering the fact that the company has since implemented more financial controls to prevent this behavior in the future.Although the class action lawsuit has been settled, and the criminal charges are likely finished, there is an ongoing SEC investigation that could be an issue. It’s really not clear what the results will be of this, but significant time has passed and the incident seems to have been an isolated issue. If the SEC were to uncover some new information that reveals the company didn’t handle the internal investigation correctly, withheld information, or transgressed worse than initially indicated, there’s a risk that the company could face fines or other punishments. If the incident was restricted to just a few former employees, as the company has repeatedly stated, this is unlikely to cause any huge problems in the future, other than maybe a fine. It gives me confidence that the new board members purchased huge stakes and took over the company when all of this information was already disclosed, so they obviously did not worry too much about the potential SEC fine. It cannot go without mention, but I believe that even with this risk considered, the investment case is still strong for GlobalScape.Aside from this, there is also the risk that the large layoffs will have a negative impact on the company’s culture. They company said the following in their shareholder letter to address this potential issue:Obviously, the fact that they said these things really proves nothing. It’s encouraging that they are considering these factors, and making changes to ensure that the layoffs don’t ruin the culture, but more time will be needed to see the effects on employee retention and culture. On the bright side, the business has clearly improved due to the changes, and it’s clear that it was previously mismanaged. This is an unquantifiable risk, but I feel that the success of the business financially, and the execution of a clearly articulated strategy could help mitigate the loss of a huge number of employees.GlobalScape has all the makings of a solid business at a fair price. For investors with a long term perspective, GlobalScape represents an opportunity for above market returns with relatively low risk. The company seems to have always had the right technology, but mismanagement and misallocation of resources has held them back. GlobalScape has what some would call a “legacy moat” around their current customer base, however they don’t have quite the same reinvestment opportunities as other software companies. They only have one actual product line, and their attempts to add other products have been unsuccessful in the past. We will see if management can find other, more efficient ways to invest in customer acquisition over time.Even if they don’t, they’ve already improved the state of the business with initiatives discussed earlier, primarily the focus on the core EFT product and generating M&S renewals. More importantly, we can trust that the current capital allocator, Robert Alpert, will have no tolerance for unnecessary expenses, and return capital to shareholders when the internal reinvestment opportunities are lacking. Through their huge 2018 repurchase, and special dividends, they’ve returned around $30m to shareholders in a little over a year. It’s clear through their shareholder letter and their capital allocation strategy that the company is prioritizing cash generation over reported earnings, and allocating the cash they generate intelligently. It’s not often that you find a solid business with intelligent capital allocators and an inexpensive valuation in the microcap universe, but GlobalScape seems to be one of them. With their renewed focus and a management team that has done everything they set out to do so far, investors can feel safe betting on GlobalScape at current levels."
4141161,103988,2018-01-30T07:59:05-05:00,EFT Cloud Services ranked among the best MFT services in the industry.MFT market is expected to grow for several years consecutively.Globalscape has achieved consistent operating results in recent years and the trend is expected to continue.,"Globalscape (GSB) was recently named a 2017 Top Workplace by the San Antonio Express News. This is the seventh time the company has won the award and it is indicative of the degree to which they invest in their employees in terms of salary, benefits, and continuing education. Also, the company recently achieved a Standard Tier Technology Partner status in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) Partner Network. This should give Globalscape more opportunity to develop future products and services on the cloud platform. Additionally, they should have greater access to organizations that use AWS.MFT is favorable to person-to-person file transfer tools or file storage and sync tools because it allows administrators: to track where files went and who opened them, define the type of access each user is granted, and set expiration dates for files. Because the files don't leave the organization's work space until the recipient downloads them, there are no duplicates circulating the Internet.Globalscape Enhanced File Transfer (EFT) Cloud Services offers its users advanced features and excellent user management tools for $495 per month for the Basic package. The basic package has bandwidth and storage limits of 100GB. The Standard tier has a 200GB limit for $1,495 and the Platinum tier has a 400GB limit for $2,995 per month. A unique feature to all three tiers is that teams are able to share files securely right away, without the need to disrupt existing workflow.The EFT Cloud Services also delivers on ease of use. You simply select the files you need and package them for the recipient. The notification email to the recipient is easy to understand and provides clear instructions on how to access the file. There are no apparent roadblocks to the file transfers as the interface integrates with the user workflow.PC Mag rates EFT Cloud Services as the best overall MFT service. When compared to the competition, EFT Cloud Services supports active directory and has multi-factor authentication which the others don't. Given that MFT is growing and Globalscape offers one of the best products on the market, it is fair to speculate that they can make some market share gains.Globalscape's market share has fluctuated between 2.45% and 3.09% since 2012. With the positive outlook on the company going forward, it is appropriate to forecast an increase from 2.72% market share in 2016 to 3.00% market share by 2020. This will signify CAGR in revenues of 8.62% over the next 4 years.Sources:MFT software revenue worldwide 2009-2013 | StatisticManaged File Transfer (NYSE:MFT) Software & Service Market - Global Industry Analysis and Forecast 2017-2025The outlook when it comes to expenses in similar. Software licenses, maintenance and support, and professional services are expected to grow roughly in line with the associated revenues. The remaining expenses are calculated with relation to their weighting in the total expenses.The end result is EBITDA, based on recurring items, that could potentially grow 22.05% per year. With virtually no publicly traded competitors of a similar size, it is difficult to calculate a justified EV/EBITDA ratio. Their EV/EBITDA ratio is currently 9.58x. It will be assumed to be 10x going forward. The financial model is as follows:GSB_Model.pdfThe intrinsic share price given by the model is $4.53. This represents a 21.16% undervaluation at the current market price of $3.57.Note: I view the recent internal investigation and subsequent $1.06M in professional fees as a one-time event for the company. I do not expect that these types of expenses will occur in the future.The discussion has, thus far, ignored Globalscape's Integrated Platform as a Service (IpaaS) product (Kenetix) which was released in June 2017. Kenetix is designed to integrate all of an organization's applications to combine simplicity and security to offer an optimal user experience. While it is still too early to tell what kind of impact Kenetix will have on Globalscape's value, the IpaaS market is expected to grow to at 41.5% from 2016-2021. If Kenetix revenues can grow at a similar rate, Globalscape goes from being a solid investment to being quite lucrative.Given the undervaluation and Globalscape's strong product offering, I believe that the stock is a buy. However, being that the company only has a $77.01M market cap, liquidity could be a problem for investors. This should not be too much of a deterrent as the company has already established a strong brand and a strong demand for their product with steady growth forecasted for the foreseeable future."
4254835,67113,2019-04-16T23:04:02-04:00,Shares have been on a tear.There looks to be more upside.May initiate a momentum trade only.,"From more or less the beginning of March, shares of GlobalSCAPE, Inc. (GSB) have been on a tear. GSB is a tech firm out of San Antonio which develops and distributes software as well as delivers hosted solutions. Shares are up close to 90% over that period. In all likelihood, the breakaway gap which basically launched the sizable move we have seen thus far will not get filled at this point. The question at present is whether we should ride this momentum trade for all that it is worth.We ponder this because a breakaway gap normally takes place at the beginning of a significant trending move. Potentially, this up-move still had plenty of legs left in it. Up to March of this year, shares had been locked in a basing pattern that lasted more than 18 months. The multi-year rounded bottom provided the fuel for the explosive rally over the past 6 weeks.Heavy volume as mentioned confirmed that breakaway gap. Investors who are long this stock with excellent entry prices can now move their stops up to the upper end of that gap at around $5 per share. This area should now act as strong support for shares of GSB. Suffice it to say, if the price was to close below this level, we would see it a sign of weakness considering the rally shares have enjoyed up to now.We do not use stop losses all the time, but would definitely use one here if we had long exposure in GlobalSCAPE. Why? Well, just look at the company's valuation. At the end of fiscal 2018, the company reported $16 million of equity on the balance sheet. Currently, its market cap is just under $130 million. This gives us a price-to-book ratio of just over 8.1. Tech stocks, as we know, do not usually hold a lot of plant and equipment on their balance sheet. In fact, GlobalSCAPE reported $16 million of goodwill and intangibles in their annual report last year. Incidentally, this is the same number as the firm's shareholder equity.Goodwill ($13 million), for example, is almost 40% of its assets, which is high. The risk here is if something like an acquisition does not produce what was originally envisioned. If this was to take place, the goodwill line item would have to be written down, which obviously would affect the net worth of the company.However, including goodwill and intangibles, GlobalSCAPE's book multiple comes in at just over 8. This means one would be getting around $0.12 of assets for every dollar invested in shares of the company. Now, if those assets keep on delivering as expected with respect to generating sales and earnings, then the book multiple comes in a distant second to earnings growth in terms of importance.But what if they don't? We always aim to size up the downside risk as well as upside gain before making an informed investment. GSB's book multiple has expanded pretty meaningfully over the past few years, which brings risk to the table with respect to sustained earnings growth.The company's sales multiple looks more attractive at 4.5. This number is well below the 7.4 average in this sector, although it is about double the sales multiple of the S&P 500. Sales growth came in at 5.7% last quarter for the company, but top line growth as a whole has been much slower over the past 5 years than from 2009 to 2014, for example. GlobalSCAPE's 5-year average sales multiple is 2.4. The danger here for the bulls would be for top line growth to remain sluggish, which would most likely result in the company's current sales multiple reverting to its longer-term mean. This would most likely mean a fall in the share price over time.Therefore, to sum up, although GSB presents an attractive momentum trade at present, we would definitely deploy stop losses here due to the valuation of this stock. Although probably not overvalued in the sector in which it operates, GSB is an expensive stock for us to hold over the long term. May update concerning the momentum trade promptly."

(NYSEMKT:GSB) offers a long-term growth opportunity to the patient investor. GSB is a pure play in the managed file transfer segment of the SaaS market. It is an underfollowed microcap with a market capitalization of ~$151 million and sales of ~$36.1 million. According to a new market report published by Credence Research, Inc. “Managed File Transfer Market”, the global managed file transfer market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 6% from 2016 to 2023. GSB’s revenue growth rate is in line with industry projections. At this rate, sales may grow from $36.1 million to $75.7 million over the next several years.No analysts follow GSB, and there are no estimates for earnings or sales available. There are no analyst target prices either. This lack of analyst coverage offers a great opportunity as the company grows and subsequently gathers analyst coverage.Sales for the twelve-month period ending March 2019 were ~$36.2 million or about 9.0% higher than the prior year period. From 12/2014 to 12/2018, sales grew, on average, 7.2% from $26.8 million to $34.4 million.Over the years, net income has been rather erratic. For the trailing twelve-month period, net income totaled $7.0 million. In the previous five years, net income was as low as $1.4 million. During this same period, earnings per share (diluted continuing) reflected this same pattern. In FY14, earnings per share were $0.15 and subsequently decreased to $0.08 in FY17. Earnings doubled in FY18 to $0.17. The past twelve months were even better, and earnings more than doubled to $0.38. Each quarter of the past twelve months saw better earnings than in the comparable quarter in the prior year.The company’s gross margins have been relatively consistent over the years, which suggests that GSB has the potential to increase earnings in the near future. Gross margins have ranged from a low of 80.7% to a high of 82.1%. In the most recent twelve-month period, gross margins expanded to 83.2%. Research by Professor Novy-Marx suggests that gross profits scaled by total assets are a good predictor of future share price.GSB’s high, scaled gross profits strongly suggest that the company will experience share price appreciation. The market recognized the company’s strong profitability in 2Q19 and bid the share price up to double its trading price in the previous quarter. As of 1Q19, scaled gross profit was 78.8%.Operating margins have fluctuated over the years and were as low as 7.7% in FY17 and as high as 20.8% in FY14. The operating margin doubled to 13.9% in FY18 as compared to 7.7% in FY17. In the past twelve-month period, the operating margin expanded to 25.6%.We see the same pattern when examining net margins. The net margin in FY15 was a high of 14.9%, and the FY17 margin was 4.0%. The net margin rebounded in FY18 to 10.6% and is now at 19.4%.The balance sheet provides the information we need to measure the financial strength of a company and the company’s ability to manage the vicissitudes of the market. There is no one metric that adequately measures financial strength, so several metrics are used. Taken together, these metrics give us a picture of the company’s strength.GSB carries no debt that by itself is a positive sign.The working capital to total assets ratio measures a company's ability to cover its short-term financial obligations (total current liabilities) by comparing its total current assets to its total assets.During this period, current liabilities remained constant ranging from $14.1 million to $16.9 million. Current liabilities averaged $15.78 million. Conversely, current assets ranged from $17.4 million to $26.1 million. Current assets averaged $20.85 million. There were significant changes in total assets. Total assets ranged from $52.5 million to $34.5 million and averaged $42.94 million. The big changes came in FY16 and FY17 when the company held long-term investments and subsequently removed these from the balance sheet.Retained earnings to total assets tells us how efficient the company manages its assets. Retained earnings is that portion of net income that remains with the company after paying out dividends.Return on total assets is a ratio that measures a company's earnings before interest and taxes relative to its total assets. We consider this ratio an indicator of how effectively a company is using its assets to generate earnings.As we see from the above graph, in 2017, GSB reversed a downward trend that began in 2015.Market capitalization to total assets tells us how much of the market cap is backed up by total assets. In other words, it is the premium the market places on a company’s assets that is related to how well the company utilizes its assets to generate profits.What we see here is that the market is expressing increasing confidence that GSB is able to generate profits in excess of the value of its underlying assets.Sales to total assets is a measure of a company's efficiency in managing its assets in relation to the revenue generated. The higher this ratio, the smaller the investment required to generate sales revenue and, therefore, the higher the profitability of the company.Since 2017, GSB has made strides in increasing its asset turnover. The asset turnover for the industry is about 70.0%, whereas for GSB, it is about 94.5%.Return on assets (ROA) is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA is an idea as to how efficient a company's management is at using its assets to generate earnings.We continue to see the effects of the turnaround that started in 2017. ROA bottomed at 2.7% and has rebounded to 17.2%. The median ROA value for the software industry -7.4%.ROE is a measure of how effectively management is using a company’s assets to create profits. GSB’s pattern of returns on equity is consistent with the other patterns seen in the above graphs. The low point is 2017, and the rebound exceeds past returns.The industry median return on equity is a paltry 2.5% whereas GSB generates a return of 33.4%.GSB started paying a dividend of $0.045 per share in 2015. The dividend increased to $0.06 per share in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The company issued a special dividend of $0.50 per share that was payable on May 28, 2019.In 2018, the company initiated a “Dutch Auction” tender offer to purchase up to $15,000,000 at purchase prices from $4.00 to $4.50 per share. The company accepted for purchase 4,011,013 shares at a purchase price of $4.20 per share at the aggregate cost of $16.8 million. The shares purchased represent approximately 18.2% of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of September 24, 2018.The dividend yield is 0.7%, and the buyback yield is 21.1%, providing a total shareholder yield for the twelve-month period of 21.1%.The current price-earnings ratio of 24.3x seems rich for a company with no analyst coverage and forward earnings estimates. Using a no-growth model of economic earnings, I estimate GlobalSCAPE’s value to be ~$8.80. GSB is growing NOPAT at the rate of 7.0% per year that indicates to me that GSB has significant upside in the coming years.GlobalSCAPE is an underfollowed microcap company with great prospects for the future. Several institutional investors already own shares. When the company grows to a size that attracts analyst attention, the company will attract a larger following. The share price has already doubled, and I would expect it to double again in the coming year."
4000660,21604,2016-08-18T13:25:18-04:00,"GlobalSCAPE provides secure information exchange capabilities for enterprises and consumers. Its customers range from individuals using CuteFTP to healthcare organizations leveraging its EFT solutions to securely send medical records.The company is debt-free, pays a 1.7% dividend and has more than $20 million in cash on its books – representing more than a quarter of its market capitalization.The company's stock has been held back by declining new licensing revenue, but management outlined plans to address these issues.","GlobalSCAPE, Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSB) provides secure information exchange capabilities to both enterprises and consumers. While it offers a number of different solutions, the company's Enhanced File Transfer™ (""EFT"") produces over 90% of its revenue and yields the largest contribution margin. EFT is an advanced and powerful managed file transfer solution that replaces insecure legacy FTP servers and other home-grown solutions.From an investor standpoint, the company's financial performance has been quite compelling over the past three years with growing revenue and net income. The company's robust $20 million cash stockpile, strong free cash flow generation and modest price-earnings multiple make it an even better bargain. The only hiccup has been declining new licensing revenue, but management outlined plans to address these issues in its second-quarter conference call.Refocusing on What WorksGlobalSCAPE reported second-quarter revenue that increased 5% to $8.3 million and net income of $954,000. Despite its seemingly solid growth, the company's license revenue has been a cause for concern for investors. New product license sales fell 11.8% during the second quarter, while overall licensing revenue fell from $3.3 million last year to $3 million this year. These declines were offset - and obscured - by higher maintenance and services revenue.Newly appointed President and CEO Matt Goulet highlighted this weakness during the company's second-quarter conference call:Mr. Goulet noted that the company has spent far too much time and resources on its non-EFT product lines that contribute less than 10% of its revenue. In order to turn around licensing revenue trends, the company will shift its focus to introducing new EFT features and functions that equip its sales and marketing teams with technologies needed to sustain and increase its revenue growth at desired levels - but without increasing overall expenditures.These efforts could help turn around new licensing revenue and address many of the concerns that have led the stock to languish over the past year.A Compelling ValuationGlobalSCAPE trades at a compelling valuation with no long-term debt and a large cash position that exceeds $20 million. In addition, the company generated more than $850,000 in free cash flow during the second quarter alone, with gross margins of nearly 80%. The company's stock also trades with a price-earnings ratio of less than 20x and a forward P/E ratio of just 12.5x, according to Morningstar, which is significantly below its peers' and the S&P 500.A major draw for value investors has been the company's $20 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. While it pays a 1.7% dividend yield, management indicated that the company plans on using the capital to invest in new products, sales efforts and potentially complementary solutions. This may be good news for growth-orientated investors, but may be a turn-off for some value investors that would have preferred a buyback or enhanced dividend.According to CFO Jim Albrecht in the company's second-quarter conference call:Management also seems to be very invested in the stock with a 43.6% ownership stake that exceeds the 28.3% owned by institutions.The Bottom LineGlobalSCAPE's stock has languished over the past year due to concerns over its licensing revenue growth and perhaps a lack of attention. With plans to refocus on its EFT platform, the company's newly appointed President and CEO could quickly turn around these problems and jumpstart its growth. This potential turnaround, combined with an attractive fundamental profile, makes the stock worthy of consideration by investors.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3704986,54942,2015-11-24T07:00:00-05:00,"Unfollowed secure file transfer company that is set to benefit from product launch ramp, improved sales force, SaaS business model, and security threats obviating old tech.Management is attempting to improve the visibility of the shares by creating an investor relations department and presenting at investor conference and road shows.The strong recurring revenue generation and very high incremental margins above 90%, along with pristine balance sheet make it a target for private equity.","We typically do not look at companies with market caps below $100 million but stumbled across a little-followed gem in the information security software development space. GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB) operated in a niche space for a number of years and investors ignored the shares. But we think the shares are approaching an inflection point whereby sustainable, recurring revenue is growing rapidly, which should further expand the multiple.The company is the leader in enhanced file transfer technology which allows the exchange of files that need to be transmitted outside of firewalls or between firewalls within the same company with minimized threat of interception. These are server-side solutions that provide a managed file transfer platform for small and medium sized businesses. Businesses and governments, including the US Army, are increasingly relying on MFT technology to encrypt and send mission-critical information in this cyber threat environment.Poised To Steal From FTP and EMail ProtocolsThe company has been around for a number of years but is only just starting to roll out their new products and drive recurring revenue. In late 2013 and early 2014, the company began selling but solely through customer inquiries with no sales or marketing division to drive awareness. Most of this awareness stemmed from when they were in the consumer FTP business which was sold under the CuteFTP brand name.During 2014, the new CEO built out their sales force and starting marketing their products, especially their MTF business which has started to inflect sales. Growth has accelerated to over 20% per year on a run-rate going into 2015 as they've moved into the channel relationship space. They have worked diligently to bring on key solution providers into their channel program in order to drive new sales.In the third quarter, one of their distribution partners has passed the 10% threshold and is producing strong sales for the company. We think as more of these new large distributor relationships come up to speed, it should produce a ramp to revenue generation. They announced a new partnership with MX Group, which, along with their existing channel relationships, will allow them to grow new accounts including with the federal government, at a much faster rate.There is an underpinning of change within the industry that is likely to help them bring about awareness of their product. Data protection concerns have been rising exponentially with each new data breach and the stealing of millions of credit card and social security numbers, and other personal information. A potential security breach could have profoundly negative effects on a company and their customers, thus trusted collaboration is becoming an essential part of any business relationship. As cloud computing takes off and the preponderance of corporate information no longer resides on an internal server, the need for more secure methods of information exchange will drive value towards MTF.On the Verge Of Accelerated Product RolloutEarlier this year, the company launched scConnect, a new file transfer protocol for enterprise clients that would work as an ""on-premise"" file synchronization and share product. It gives users secure content mobility allowing the sharing and access to data anytime on any device, something many of their competitor products do not allow. The product is geared towards the new environment with a replicated cloud experience, though it is not cloud-based, but without the risk or even reliability issues related to share infrastructures. Management is attempting to integrate the product with their BMC gateway functionality to improve the ability with which customers can deploy the product while advancing the security of the enterprise architecture.The competitive advantage which we think will drive adoption with enterprises is that it gives the company IT administrators oversight and control to monitor the usage and transfer of data. For the IT department, it gives users greater control of information without using third-party tools or security software. The software is revolutionary because it offers fully encrypted file transfer and role-based access under a centralized user management system and granular dashboard with detailed audit trails. Essentially, it allows greater mobility of data within an increased risk environment.The company purchased Tappin for $9 million in cash in 2011. The technology they acquired was an important one in getting them the capability for secure file transfer software on mobile devices. In the third quarter, they continued to expand their software to service offering with the launch of EFT Cloud Service. They also launched new releases of existing products including version 7.2 of EFT, and version 5 of WAFS, which introduces a new communications mechanism that will improve the speed and reliability of the product.The company is nearing an inflection point where they have a full suite of updated and new products that are functionally complete and can meet the business needs of their clients. We think this is evident in the growth of demand along with their improved marketing efforts which helped increase new bookings by 34% in the latest quarter versus the year before.(Source: Investor Presentation)Balance Sheet And Business Model Provide ProtectionThe company is shifting towards a software-as-a-service business model through their new cloud and cloud-like offerings. Over half of all revenue is derived not from new sales but recurring maintenance and support contracts which have almost a 100% attach rate to license sales. These contracts are valued at approximately one-quarter of license sales annually.The company has nearly $16 million in cash on the balance sheet with positive operating cash flow of $7.5 million. They have no debt on the books today which creates a solid and very clean balance sheet. The company is already free cash flow positive with a yield of nearly 6%. The financial resources available to them will allow the company to invest in new product development and grow inorganically.Lastly, given the very strong balance sheet and the amount of recurring revenue, we think there is a high likelihood of a private equity buyout. A smaller private equity firm (the company is too small for the larger firms) could come in and use the recurring, sustainable revenue generation and lever up the balance sheet to greatly grow their top line.ValuationThis micro-cap company has a management team that is clearly not experienced in dealing with investors, sell-side analysts, or communicating efficiency. The Street has zero analysts covering the name for obvious reasons which is likely a result of the lack of proper shareholder communications. The company does not give formal guidance figures and tends to be extremely conservative. As we've progressed through the year, they have not updated their guidance for the increased margins and better-than-expected top line growth. Thus, due to the lack of sell-side research, investors could be assuming a contraction in performance in the fourth quarter and beyond.In the most recent quarter, management noted that starting in November, they would become more proactive with respect to investor outreach, including participation in Mondale road shows and investor conferences. We think this should help expand their company awareness along with eventually garnering some sell-side research to eliminate the mispricing. These events are the primary area where micro-cap companies can achieve broader investor audience and earn high-quality institutional investors that will drive the shares.With over 16.5% of the market cap in net cash and a conservative management team not willing to overpay for acquisitions, we think the free cash flow generation and dividend payouts support the shares at the current price. Management and the board hold a significant amount of shares and the failure of the Tappin and Core Trace acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 are likely to make them more prudent in future acquisitions.Due to the recurring revenue business model, top-line growth visibility is very high. We modeled out reasonable growth along with ancillary revenue generation along with some EBITDA generation. We think these figures are all fairly conservative given the scalability of the business model. The model also ignores the potential for a share buyback which we think is high given the share price weakness (and they've conducted them in the past).The downside is not only protected by the strong recurring revenue stream but also due to dividend yield which on a forward rate is over 1.60%. We think this mispricing will be rectified over the next several quarters as they improve the visibility of their shares while ramping up their new products. We also think a private equity buyout or acquisition by a strategic acquirer in the cloud space is also a strong probability.ConclusionGlobalSCAPE is a micro-cap company on the verge of breaking out as they launch new products and modernize their business model. The company is set to benefit from their new products that are being launched in conjunction with a sales force and marketing budget along with IR improvements to enhance the visibility of the shares. The downside to the thesis is muted given the pristine balance sheet, dividend yield, and prudent management team set to grow conservatively.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3856036,60091,2016-02-02T10:36:26-05:00,"GlobalSCAPE is in an industry experiencing secular growth from industry wide and governmental regulations.Secular growth has translated into high single digit topline growth, coupled with a strong bottom line and attractive FCF generating abilities.The company appears to be fairly valued on an absolute basis, yet is undervalued on a relative basis.When taking into consideration the multiples paid for the buyouts of its peers, the company is significantly undervalued.With 27% of its market cap in cash and zero long-term debt, the downside is minimal.","GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB) is a microcap company in the growth stage of its business cycle, selling for a reasonable price. Demand for the services/products is secular, with no signs of slowing down in the near to med-term. Furthermore, downside is limited due to the company's strong balance sheet and FCF generating abilities. I believe that GSB is a great example of a microcap company that can continue compounding its business model going forward.SummaryGSB provides its customers with service information exchange capabilities. Moreover, they simplify the transmission of critical information (financial data, medical records, customer files, vendor files, personal files, transaction activity, and other documents). Furthermore, GSB's products and services help customers monitor and audit the file transfers between networks. Finally, GSB serves more than one million individual consumers (many of which are Fortune 100 companies) in over 150 countries.Secular DemandThe products and services that GSB serves to customers is currently in growth mode. As the internet becomes more intertwined in business and even personal life, GSB will continue to thrive. Furthermore, GSB's products are valuable for their customers for they allow their customers to meet government and industry standards/regulations. Not only do their products help their users meet these ever increasing standards/regulations, but variable cost is reduced via lower IT costs, and there is an increase in efficiency and productivity.What is interesting to me, and makes for a unique business model is that the need to transfer information across diverse geographical areas is ever increasing. Furthermore, the need to protect this information has allowed companies like GSB to experience significant growth. Moreover, there are a few key regulations that are driving secular demand for GSB's products/services…Not to mention, data breaches at big time retailers (think of the recent Target breach) in the most recent years has led to continual demand for products/services that GSB offers.Since the industry that GSB operates in is in growth mode with low barriers to entry, there is a significant amount of competitors. Not only is there a significant amount of competitors in the industry, but there has been a vast amount of consolidation, which may hinder GSB's pricing ability. However, despite the significant amount of competition, I believe that GSB has created great customer recognition for their products/services, which will help to continue growing demand. Take a look at the multiple awards the company has won in 2014 and 2013…Source: 2014 Annual ReportSource: 2014 Annual ReportWith the worldwide industry needs for compatibility, scalability and privacy, GSB has stepped in to offer a cost-effective solution. GSB has a sticky and scalable business model that they can leverage to produce top and bottom line growth for shareholders. The company has sold their products/services to some of the world's largest manufacturers, distributors, banks, insurance companies, healthcare providers, automakers, film companies and other technology providers.As long as businesses and individuals continue to utilize the internet and more importantly, value the need of transferability/privacy, secular demand for GSB's products will continue.ValuationIn the last quarter (Q4), GSB posted the highest quarterly revenue ever, in the company's history. On a YOY basis, revenue increased 8%. Furthermore, annual revenue came in at $30.8mm, which was the highest annualized revenue ever in the company's history. Moreover, on a YOY basis, annual revenue increased by a strong 15%.On a historical standpoint, GSB has grown their topline at an attractive rate…In millionsTo avoid cherry picking data, revenues in the past ten, five and three years (from the TTM), have increased at an annualized CAGR rate of 10.55%, 7.39% and 7.72%, respectively. Interestingly, GSB has been able to grow its topline at a decent rate in the past, with little shareholder dilution…In millionsWhat is also remarkable is how the company has stayed relatively profitable throughout the past decade.GSB's high gross margins suggest that the company is very efficient at utilizing their labor efforts and/or supplies in the overall production process. High gross margins also allow companies like GSB to spend money on things such as R&D (which is a much needed expense for GSB).My thesis for an investment in GSB is based upon high single to low double digit revenue growth and coupled with correspondingly strong margin generation. As the company continues to growth their business, I believe that the market will eventually award the company with a higher multiple. Below, I have provided a few techniques the company plans on using going forward to increase their topline.One strategy the company has to leverage its topline, while also influencing the bottom line is the use of third-party sellers. In the most recent years, GSB has outsourced the majority of their selling efforts to third-party contractors. Outsourcing sales to third-party contractors allows the company to focus its efforts on developing and enhancing new products, while at the same time, not forgoing the opportunity cost of getting into the field and selling the products themselves.The use of third-party contracts has reduced marketing and selling expenses and increased the topline. In fact, without the use of third-party contractors, it would take GSB several years to accomplish what third-party contractors have done. Furthermore, GSB's plan to continue driving their topline going forward is to expand their relationships with more third-part resellers.The use of tablets and smart phones in the industry workplace is also a significant future demand driver. For an example, in 2011 GSB acquired TappIn Solutions. This acquisition allows the company to help its customers safely, easily and securely share data and information via tablet and/or smartphone. Furthermore, the acquisition of TappIn Solutions will allow the company to play the ever increasing user growth in tablets and smartphones, in the business industry. Finally, in fiscal year of 2014 TappIn Solution's revenue growth increased 44%, further strengthening my thesis on continual industry demand via tablets and smartphones.Also, GSB's product, Enhanced File Transfer is much needed in the industry, scalable and cost efficient for users. In terms of scalability, the company releases new add-ons frequently, which provides businesses with an increased security feature, automation and performance. In short, the company can continue to upsell new add-on modules to existing customers, thus increasing topline growth. Not to mention, GSB's products help reduce their customers upfront costs, which allows them to become more profitable and efficient.Finally, the company's SaaS subscription solutions may become more valuable in the future. This subscription solution gives GSB recurring revenue and provides customers with low upfront costs. Comparing the SaaS subscription solution to on premise software licenses, we can see that the latter must be reconstituted almost every period unlike the former solution. Furthermore, the SaaS subscription solutions may become a much bigger part of the overall consolidated sales in the future.Secular demand for the company's core product offering will help grow the topline and marginally increase the bottom line. I have provided two case scenarios that may transpire in the near-termIn millionsThe bull case is based off of 10% topline growth from the TTM revenue, with a 26% EBITDA margin (the TTM margin) and a multiple expansion to 8.00x. I believe that this is a conservative case for the FY of 2016. For the base case, revenues are hypothesized to growth at a 7.5% rate, with an EBITDA margin of 22% (average EBITDA margin for the past three years), and while keeping the current multiple. This case is more conservative and goes to show that GSB may be fairly priced.As for the downside, I believe that downside is relatively limited. First the company's cash position equals 27.2% of the market cap. Furthermore, the cash position grew 32% during 2015, which supports the company's FCF generating ability. Also the zero debt on the balance sheet, allows the company to have very low fixed costs, which helps to offset downside. Finally, I believe that if the company can continue to grow its topline at high single digit rates, with incremental bottom line expansions, the market will continue to value the company higher, instead of lower.Catalysts for Further UpsideRisksCompetition in the industry is rampant and filled with companies that are much larger than GSB. Also continual consolidation may put pricing pressures on GSB's products.GSB has to continually spend money on R&D due to rapid tech changes in the industry. An improper use of R&D spending may hinder the company's ability to innovate properly and compete in the market.The industry is filled with governmental regulations. Further regulations may hinder GSB's business model going forward. However, as of recently, regulations have provided the company with secular demand.The company derives a decent amount of their revenues from maintenance and support. Any adverse decreases in maintenance and support revenues will hinder the company's topline. Furthermore, if the company does not sell more licenses of its product, revenues may decrease.The sales cycle for the company's products is long and can be unpredictable. Thus, sales may be lumpy going forward due to the significant amount of time it takes to sell the company's core offerings. Overall, operating results may be bumpy and unpredictable down the road due to the long sales cycle.ConclusionCurrently, not many individuals are following the GSB story. However, that can change if the company continues to post record breaking results. Moreover, based on the secular demand for GSB's products, I have high confidence that high single digit revenue growth will continue going forward. With a current EB/EBITDA multiple of 7.80x, GSB is fairly priced. However, the company has a significant amount of ability to continue compounding their business model for long-term shareholders without dilution. I believe that more analysts will start to recognize GSB in the future, which will act as a catalyst. In fact, I would be surprised if GSB is not a >$100mm market cap company in the next 3-4 years.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(NYSEMKT:GSB) is currently offering investors an opportunity to buy portions of the company at about $3.60/share. The stock has come down since the beginning of the year, putting in a solid base in the mid-$3s, and may now provide a good entry point. Right now, GSB is about fifteen percent off the 52-week low hit this summer at about $3.15 per ownership interest. This multi-month base provides long-term investors with a good opportunity to initiate a position.GlobalSCAPE has a business model that is simple and sustainable. According to its website, the company ""ensures the reliability of mission-critical operations by securing sensitive data and intellectual property."" Also according to the website, GlobalSCAPE's ""primary commercial vertical markets include finance, health care, energy, retail, manufacturing, and engineering. We also have a customer base in the local, state, and federal government spaces."" According to its most recent annual report, revenue actually grew over 15% year over year. Earnings per share grew over 45% over the same year. The company is able to increase its revenue at a rate that crushes inflation, passing along the devastating effects of inflation on to its customers, not its shareholders.Despite the growth, I believe the company trades at a discount to its true valuation. GSB currently trades at 12 times forward earnings, under 4 times cash, and under 20 times free cash flow. It appears to be heading in the right direction as a company, and I am content to accumulate shares at this perceived discount. EPS has grown at an average of 35% annually for the past 5 years, and is expected to grow over 25% next year. Even if future EPS remains flat, you're still only paying 12 times earnings. That's half of the P/E of many of its competitors in the Application Software industry. GSB is the type of company that I want to own for the long haul, and this appears to be an opportune time to initiate my position.GlobalSCAPE also has a decent yield for a growth company: you get paid to wait, while revenue growth and EPS growth take your investment higher over the years. GSB has a current yield of 2%. Is the dividend sustainable? Absolutely. The company's payout ratio is under 30%, giving it ample room to continue paying and possibly increase its dividend. Additionally, GSB is sitting on $0.91 of cash per share. That's about 60 quarters, or 15 years' worth of dividend payments at the current rate.Despite the above positive factors, the main attractive quality here is to buy a highly profitable, quality company at 12 times forward earnings. Even if profits were to stagnate or regress from here, it's still trading at less than 4 times cash on hand and under 20 times free cash flow. Additionally, and this point can be overlooked, the company has no debt whatsoever. You read that correctly. Zip. Zero. Zilch. None. This is a profitable cash cow of a company with solid free cash flow, high margins, no debt, and trading at a low earnings multiple.As always, this article represents my opinions at the time of writing. You should do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. However, I believe GlobalSCAPE represents a quality company that is trading hands at a discount.

Company assets have become ideas and processes verses machines and equipment.Globalscape is a pioneer in Managed File Transfer (MFT) with its history going back over twenty years with the introduction of their first consumer file transfer product. As the need for a more robust, more secure, hardened solution emerged in the enterprise environment, the MFT product was introduced. This encompassed stronger encryption algorithms for greater security, data protocol implementations to meet regulatory requirements and data sharing functionality to building trusted partner networks.The MFT market is approximately 1B and is characterized as mature (6% ACGR) with IBM dominating market share at 35%. The market is highly fragmented with numerous smaller competitors. Globalscape has a 4% market share and has distinguished itself as a leader in security and compliance. The company has blue chip roster of customers with names like Wal-Mart, JP Morgan Chase and the US Army which is a testament to the company’s product strength.New Product Offering IPaaS:The Integrated Platform as a Service (IpaaS) was released in June 2017 and is the company’s foray into a market contiguous to the MFT market. The product is in response the explosion of both structured and unstructured data. In the past, most data resided in the company's ERP system. The enterprise resource planning system included your payable and receivable modules, accounting functionality and HR, etc. This data is considered structured because a relational database provided the data record when called up. For example, when you looked up a customer balance, the link was to a common database.As the market for ERP became more sophisticated, best of breed providers began offering richer individual modules like CRM from different vendors than the ERP provider. In Addition, with the advent of the internet, email, texts, videos, etc, a new massive data set was created (unstructured data). How do I aggregate all this disparate data? This is essentially what IPaaS was created to do. Create the required data pool and then build queries and reports as an end user without the need for IT.The market size for IPaaS is rapidly approaching 1B which basically doubles the addressable market for Globalscape. Since it is a SaaS offering, you can turn on the services rapidly without any initial investment.Strong Cash Flow and Financial Position:Globalscape has a PE of approximately 26 with trailing EPS of .19 cents per share. The company has 26M in cash and no debt. Excluding cash, the company has a PE of 19.6. The balance sheet is pristine with high liquidity and modest short term liabilities. Shares outstanding are 23M.Globalscape only needs modest sales from IpaaS to offset the incremental costs related to Sales and Marketing. Therefore this would create a significant amount of operating leverage in the event the product gets a foothold. This, in concert with the continued growth & development for the MFT product and possible acquisition targets, make me optimistic the future looks bright.Risks:Micro-cap – The company has a market cap of just over $100M. While market liquidity has improved, there are days when volume is low. This can contribute to beta movements that are higher than the overall market.New product uptake – While sounding promising, only the future will determine the success of any new product and its magnitude. In addition, there will be some incremental opex expense to support the product roll-out.Overall (macro) Market is fully priced and may correct.3.5M stock options plan has been approved going forward. Approximately 15% dilution over the next 3 years. This was deemed necessary to attract and retain talent.Competitors both established and emerging are rife in the market. Large and emerging competitors can access larger resource pools. Market is rapidly changing which will require companies to continually add functionality to compete.Acquisitions & integrationThe company may attempt to acquire companies in the same space to gain market share. Targets would have bought at a favorable price and successfully integrated.Conclusion:Globalscape represents an attractive investment opportunity for a patient investor with a regimented approach to investing. The company has done an extraordinary job in adhering to fundamental investing principles. The company has grown steadily and profitably while investing for the future. The Company several years ago implemented a dividend of 1.5% which underscores management’s recognition that a return of capital or on capital beyond capital appreciation is important. This has meant you got paid to wait in periods when the stock traded sideways.In stark contrast to the type of companies I see today, this is reassuring to me. When I look at the private market with companies like Uber and recent company IPOs like Box, the red ink runs as far as the eye can see. Of course when you sell a product that cost $1.50 for a $1 you will have long lines. I admit to having often been spotted in these lines myself. I think the problem is that many of these companies are headed for real trouble. When that happens new management will enter. They won’t be dyslexic. It will be obvious to them that you have to sell a product for a $1.50 that cost a $1 not the other way around.Globalscape cost structure can be summed up in one word – lean. The company has a very low percentage of body fat. With high gross margins and SG&A costs that are right sized, they have achieved profitability while investing for the future. Globalscape, keep up the good work and don’t get flabby."

GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB) is a provider of software for secure data transfers encompassing the full spectrum of partners, customers, and machine to machine data exchanges. They offer an award winning solution and have a Blue Chip clientele including the Fortune 500 and the US Army. After successfully building an ironclad reputation around product security in core MFT (Managed File Transfer) segment, the company is rolling out products that promote information sharing within a controlled environment.The company has recently released a workplaces module that offers flexibility to their core EFT product. The traditional mentality in the software industry has been insular with a fortress mentality. The primary objective was to prevent a penetration of the company network. Companies achieved this objective by building a walled garden which established a muscular perimeter around company data. However, with relentless pricing pressure, companies began to embrace the idea of open, cooperative partnerships. As a result, companies need to embrace data sharing while still controlling access to the network. This would entail policies which define who can have access, enforcing restrictions post access, and providing detailed auditing capabilities. GlobalSCAPE will be introducing a product which addresses the emerging BYOD (Bring you own device) trend which is in essence, mobile computing in the workplace, shortly. This product, tentatively called Tappin Enterprise or scConnect will compete head to head will Box in this space. One distinct advantage for GlobalSCAPE, will be an on premise deployment versus the cloud. There is a reticence by CTO's with respect to ceding sensitive data storage offsite. For GlobalSCAPE, this product is really a natural outgrowth for EFT since many of the essential underpinning are the same for file sharing or ECM (Enterprise Content Management). The market size and growth rate for the ECM is significant and has attracted many suitors like bees to honey. However, GlobalSCAPE's has been successful against large competitors like IBM (NYSE:IBM) in MFT, and should be in the collaboration space as well. From an investor's standpoint, any new revenue from their foray into collaboration will be immediately accretive to earnings and should drive the share price forward.Valuation Matters:A fundamental concept on investing centers around price acquisition. Ultimately, if you don't overpay, you chances of get hurt are reduced. So, if you are going to dangle out of the window, you should do it out the first floor and not the fortieth floor. This is why GlobalSCAPE looks attractive on the both an absolute and relative basis versus Box.GlobalSCAPE - Rational Valuation - Market Cap 70MTrailing PE 22 EPS .15Forward PE 14 (Annualize Q4 .06 EPS and you get .24 EPS) Ex future growth.Forward PE Ex Cash 11 ($3.27-.67= $2.60/.24=11PEG Ratio = .67 Q4 Growth 33%/PE 22=.67 Can be indicative of going forward Price/Earnings compression which increases price attractiveness.Box - Lofty Valuation - Market Cap 2BRevenue growth of 70%Loss of 182MRisks:MacroRisk factors include GlobalSCAPE is Micro-cap which tend to be have less liquidity and higher beta price movements relative to the broader market.MicroMFT/File Collaboration markets are fiercely competitive with a myriad of players some of which have more capital resources.Conclusion:GlobalSCAPE has the right mix of solid profitability, lean cost structure, and product innovation. Box, by contrast is a worthy competitor with ambitions of becoming a software juggernaut. I don't think anyone questions that Aaron Levie is bright and has built a enviable company, but in the real world only Wimpy was able to pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today. Box, like many of the IPOs making their way to market today, may have a rude awakening if investors start extrapolating losses out into the future and decide to head for the exits. Investors are exactly like vendors, you can only pay with IOUs for so long.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
3514176,93006,2015-09-16T11:19:01-04:00,"GSB is leveraging its position as the market leader in managed file transfer.Expansion into adjacent markets is now in place.Clean balance sheet, recognized brand quality and small size make GSB a takeover play.","GlobalSCAPE Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSB) provides software solutions and related products for enterprises, government agencies and consumers. Last year the company changed its game plan and began transitioning away from dependency on direct sales by escalating their channel partners as well as broadening their product line into new markets. In this article, I'm going to break down what GSB does, their addressable market, their competition and their valuation.GSB was spun off from American TeleSource in 1994 and completed its IPO in 2000. The company origins were in managed file transfers, a market worth about $800 million and expected to grow according to IDC research, fueled by legal requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability Act (HIPA) and the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act.GSB's original product was CuteFTP, file transfer protocol (FTP) software that the company continues selling today. GSB has been expanding into adjacent markets. Mail Express was added to enter the secure email gateway market worth $996 million, according to Gartner. scConnect launched this spring is a product that addresses the need to provide security in mobile devices fueled by the BYOD trend. scConnect is as a secure on-premises alternative to public cloud mobility tools. This market segment, synchronization and sharing, is worth about $500 million, according to Gartner. In secure email the majority of market share is divided among Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).GSB has an elite list of customers which include most of the Fortune 500 companies as well as the U.S. military. The company has established its mark in the quality of its products and in being the market leader in managed file transfer. I won't go into all of the awards and press coverage but will mention two that I think are notable. GSB was given an Editor's Choice and highest ranking by PC for best secured managed file services for 2015. And for the second consecutive year GSB was named Champion by InfoTech Research in the Managed File Transfer Landscape.I cited the recognition that GBS has received because the company is attempting to leverage its leadership in managed file transfer into gaining market share in the WAN Optimization market, worth over a billion dollars according to Gartner. Later this year their version 5 product will be released with additional capabilities such as access for remote users. Increased sales from penetration into WAN Optimization and the synchronization arenas are where this stock could become very interesting. There's major competition in each market segment. In WAN it competes against Cisco, Riverbed and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), among many others. In synchronization the major competitors are Citrix, Box (NYSE:BOX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and a host of others. The secure email market is dominated by Proofpoint, Microsoft and Cisco. The overall managed file transfer industry is fragmented and while there are many players GSB is the market leader and major players include IBM (NYSE:IBM), Box and Citrix.Last year, GSB began its business plan transformation with key hirings and expanded its sales program into a multi-tiered reward system with over 150 partners. Just last week they added another key component to their sales channel with the addition of immixGroup which will provide sales in the federal and public sectors.The company doled out special dividend payments in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and initiated a regular quarterly dividend of .015 per share earlier this year. Some highlights from the Q1 2015 earnings report include revenue increased 20% from Q1 2014. Maintenance and support exceeded $4M for the first time in its history while new license bookings grew 41% YoY from Q1 2014.GBS has no debt and about $15 million in cash. The company has been consistently growing revenues, EPS, operating margin and book value per share.GSB Book Value (Quarterly) data by YChartsThere is no analyst coverage on this company and management has not given any guidance on future expectations. Insiders have skin in the game with over 40% of the float. The stock valuation is relatively cheap on historical comparisons. With a trailing PE of 16, it's selling at about a 50% discount to it historic PE and its selling at discount to its established growth rate of over 70%.The company attracted investor interest when it kicked off its new strategic plan in 2014 as the stock spiked up, doubling in price.GSB data by YChartsGSB is a small cap that has an established market niche and is tackling much larger competitors in an attempt to expand its market niche. I think this company will be bought out as it is a small bite for a larger player just because it's a quality name with a clean balance sheet. If it does not get bought out, any advances it makes into penetrating new markets is a plus. I see much more upside than downside and took an entry position. My bet is that I won't have to worry about adding or not since this company will be bought out.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4008071,102102,2016-09-24T09:42:54-04:00,"GlobalSCAPE is a growing and profitable micro-cap company with 0 debt and over 25% of its market cap in cash.The company grew revenues 8% in 2013, 10% in 2014, and 15% in 2015. It also operates in an industry projected to grow 10% through 2020.It has struggled the last 3 quarters, and its stock price has traded sideways since 2015, but a CEO transition and refocusing on its core technology platform could re-accelerate growth.Deferred revenue trends lend credence to the turnaround story.Base case valuation gives a 40% return through 2018, or 16% annualized; bull/bear cases are positively skewed 1.7x.","Company and industry overview:GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB), headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, services the Managed File Transfer (MFT) market. MFT is the management and transfer of secure data files between servers, people, or platforms(source)An easy example is a personal health record accessed across different departments in a hospital; each access point must be secure, and the data must be accurately maintained at all times.MFT is necessary for many types of enterprises: as mentioned, hospitals, but other examples include healthcare firms (for transferring and accessing drug trial results and patient data, etc.), government contractors (engineering plan collaboration, personnel records, security software, etc.), and financial institutions (trade requests and records, portfolio tracking, etc.). Nearly every industry is increasingly using data to drive business - and thus need MFT to secure and access their data.GlobalSCAPE's primary customer base is in the finance, health care, energy, retail, and entertainment sectors. Some of their largest and big-name customers are shown below:(Company Presentation, July 2016)Quick Business Segment OverviewIn order to understand the investment opportunity in GSB, we need to understand how it operates, earns revenues, and converts revenues to profit. Its important business segments are as follows:MFT Market Growth:As previously stated, nearly all businesses are becoming more connected and creating more data which require secure transfer and management services. As a result, the MFT industry is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR through 2020, and at an 8% CAGR through 2024 (according to industry research reports, see links here and here). GSB's CEO Matt Goulet mentioned to me that GSB's own industry analysis indicated the market will grow around 10% for the foreseeable future.MFT Industry PlayersThe MFT market is dominated by IBM with a 37% market share (according to a 2015 report on year-end 2014). Behind IBM, the industry is very fragmented. As a result, the industry is very top- and bottom-heavy:This makes the market ripe for consolidation for mid-size players such as GlobalSCAPE. According to Mr. Goulet, this is precisely what has occurred - the company has taken market share for 3 years in a row. In 2014, the industry revenue growth breakdown was as follows:As mentioned, in 2015 GlobalSCAPE grew revenues 15% (and its core MFT product line 17%), consolidating share from the market growing ~10%.GlobalSCAPE's Business and Products are Award-Winning:For what these are worth, GlobalSCAPE is a highly-awarded company with highly-awarded products. In 2016, its EFT platform has earned several honors in the following categories:Its employees also seem to love the company: in 2016, GlobalSCAPE has been named a ""Best Place to Work in IT,"" an ""Employer of the Year,"" and a ""Best Place to Work in Texas,"" - based off of anonymous employee surveys. These honors follow similar awards from the past several years.GSB's last 3 quarters have been a struggle:Not all is rosy at GlobalSCAPE, however. In the last 3 quarters (beginning in Q4'15), GlobalSCAPE has seen its primary license business revenues decline by -2% y/y, -6% y/y, and -12% y/y. These declines seem to be a worrying trend for GSB's primary product division which also drives all maintenance and support contracts.Strong performance in M&S contracts and Professional Services have offset the poor licensing performance, but margins have declined significantly and net income has decreased by -50% and -28% y/y in the last two quarters:Revenue Deceleration(Finsight Funds GSB Model)Margin Impact, Net Income DeclinesAs a result, the stock price, which has more than doubled since late 2013, has languished since the beginning of 2015 and is down 12% YTD.(Marketwatch and Finsight Funds)We need to understand clearly why the company is suddenly struggling while its industry is growing.Story, Part 1: CEO TurnoverGSB appointed a new CEO on May 16 of this year, tapping Mr. Matt Goulet to replace Mr. James Bindseil to ""usher in GlobalSCAPE's next phase of growth.""This is GlobalSCAPE's third CEO in the last four years. Unfortunately, a tragic story lies behind the turnover at GSB's helm.Story, Part 2: Non-Core Business Focus led to ""Technical Debt"":Upon his hiring as full-time CEO, Mr. Bindseil (GSB's previous CEO) said:While new growth is desirable for any business, it often requires large upfront investments. According to Mr. Goulet (GSB's new CEO), over the last two years roughly 50% of GSB's research and development costs went into product lines tangential to the company's core EFT platform. As a result, GlobalSCAPE's EFT platform capabilities began to fall behind competitors - what Mr. Goulet termed ""technical debt.""This technical debt has caused GSB to miss out on contracts it otherwise expected to win, leading to revenue deceleration.Story, Part 3: Investments, Seasonality, Shift to Cloud:Other factors have also contributed to GSB's deteriorating fundamentals over the last 3 quarters.As costs have been incurred but sales have yet to materialize, margin erosion has occurred. GlobalSCAPE's Sales and Marketing as % of revenue since the beginning of 2015 show leveraging followed by a spike in 4Q'15 and 1Q'16:As these costs begin to lever again, GSB should see margin traction.Re-focusing on core technology to drive growth:Readers will recall that the core EFT platform directly and indirectly accounted for 93% of revenue in 2015. After his appointment as CEO, Mr. Goulet reviewed GlobalSCAPE's business segments and R&D budget, and committed to refocusing on GlobalSCAPE's core EFT platform. A few quotes from the latest earnings release which I believe are important to understanding the GSB story:Focusing on the core business segment as well as its core target market seems like a wise and prudent move.Management is Reiterating 2016 Company Targets:Strategy shifts require time and often, arduous operational execution; however, GlobalSCAPE's core EFT platform is still a competitive and award-winning product, and Mr. Goulet believes his company is already making up its technical debt.Through speaking with Mr. Goulet, I learned that the start to Q3 has been positive, that the company's sales pipeline is the biggest in history, and that the new sales and marketing initiatives are working and inspiring confidence.At the beginning of 2016, management issued growth and profitability targets for the year - 15% revenue growth and a 15% net margin. After the poor start to the year, hitting these targets will require impeccable execution, but management is convinced these are still achievable.In the 2Q earnings release, the company stated:Mr. Goulet again affirmed to me a couple weeks ago that these targets are still reachable, which means that 3Q and 4Q are likely to show a dramatic return to growth and high levels of profitability.Deferred Revenue TrendsIn order to gain more insight into the company's 2H'2016, we can look to the company's deferred revenue on its balance sheet. GSB's deferred revenue comes from M&S contracts as well as from cloud SaaS services. To be clear, these are revenues which are already agreed upon, but due to the matching principle of accounting, have yet to be realized in the income statement.GlobalSCAPE's Deferred Revenue is as follows:We can see a downward trend from 1Q'15-3Q'15 that preceded GSB's deteriorating revenues. The last two quarters, however, have seen deferred revenue again trending upward.Over the last two years, GlobalSCAPE's deferred revenue growth and its realized revenue growth in the next quarter has a 54% correlation.This all suggests that GSB's refocusing on the core technology, sales and marketing investments, and its cloud SaaS business will indeed yield a return to strong financial performance in 2H'2016.Valuation - How Much is this Story Worth?:Valuing GlobalSCAPE depends on how much one believes the turnaround story.Base Case:In my base case valuation scenario, I assume that for the remainder of 2016, EFT license growth recovers to 14%, maintenance & support contracts steadily grow at 13% (supported by healthy deferred revenue trends), and Professional Services continues to grow quickly from a low base.The result is 12% revenue growth for all of 2016 (recall management's 15% target):I assume that gross margins improve from the first half of the year to 83% as the core EFT products and M&S revenues should again elevate gross margin. I project operating expenses as % of revenue to remain the same as 2015 and 2Q'16, resulting in EBIT and net margin acceleration. Net margin for the year of 11.6% remains well below management's 15% target, as it seems doubtful GSB can reach this lofty goal with such a poor first half.For 2017 and 2018, I assume revenue growth of 14% driven as follows:Because of the growth of Professional Services, I project gross margins will stabilize at 82%, in line with GlobalSCAPE's 2015 gross margin but below 2014's gross margin of 86%.I believe EBIT margins can stabilize at 19%, as the company's investments in sales and marketing begin to lever and pay off. This leads to net margins in the mid-12% range. While management is targeting 15%, it seems this would take impeccable execution. Additionally, I think that GlobalSCAPE will need to make continued investments to maintain growth and hold off competitors.Net income, therefore, grows 23% and 14% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.Finally, I assume continued small share count dilution (for all scenarios):Through all these figures, I arrive at EPS estimates of $0.18, $0.22, and $0.24 for 2016-2018.GSB's current trailing P/E multiple of 20x seems fair for a company with its growth prospects but also with its recent troubles. Applying this multiple to GSB's 2018 projected earnings results in a target price of $4.79. This represents a return of 40% to investors over the next two and a half years:As a result, I recommend GSB as a long to medium-term investors with a medium risk tolerance. My 2018 PT of $4.79 implies 16% annualized gains.Other scenarios:GlobalSCAPE is at an important inflection point. It will either return to growth through focusing on its core business, or it will be unable to make up the technical debt it has accumulated. While my base case assumes the story plays out more toward the former, I also explore the bear and bull case scenarios below.Bearish scenario:In my bearish scenario, GlobalSCAPE's revenue deceleration turns out to be permanent. It is only able to grow its EFT product at 5% p.a., half the rate of the market. Its maintenance and support contracts follow the license revenue deceleration, growing by 6% p.a., and its professional services contracts quickly decelerate:Due to deleveraging and higher costs under the bearish scenario, margins would compress quickly; gross margins would stabilize at 80%, the lowest in recent company history. Deleveraging would cause EBIT margins to compress to 10%, and net margin would fall to under 7%:In this bearish scenario, GSB would likely be afforded a much lower multiple; 15x could be appropriate given the company's much slower growth as well as lower earnings profile. In this scenario, the 2018 target price of $1.58 implies downside of ~50%, or -27% annualized through 2018:While I don't think this is likely, this is a very bad, yet plausible scenario if GSB is unable to turn around its business.Bullish scenario:In an equally unlikely but plausible bullish scenario, GlobalSCAPE's strategy shift could pay off quickly.I assume that in this case, GSB's EFT product line returns to dramatic growth, which also drives maintenance and support contracts. I model its Professional Services division to continue to rapidly expand, although at a decelerating pace as the revenue base gets larger.Total revenue growth for 2016 is still below management's target, but 2017 and 2018 register 18% growth:In this bullish scenario, expenses would become levered by the increase in revenues. Gross profit margin would stabilize at 84%, reflecting strong pricing but continued growth of Professional Services. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative leverage would drive EBIT margins to register at a very high 25%. This flows to a 16.3% net margin:Due to its strong financial performance in this scenario, GSB stock could see its trailing P/E expand. Applying a 24x multiple, appropriate for a company growing revenue and earnings at a torrid pace, results in a target price of $8.21. Upside in the bullish scenario is roughly 135%, or 46% annually through 2018.These scenarios are useful to imagine the cone of outcomes for GSB stock. The upside is 1.7x the downside, representing a positively skewed risk/reward profile.Peer ComparisonAs an additional valuation metric, I compared GSB with its competitors. This turned out to be somewhat difficult, as its primary competitors are either private, unprofitable, or much larger.However, the analysis is still likely useful:(Please note that FY0 means the last completed fiscal year)Looking at the comp set, we can see that GSB is growing revenue and earnings much quicker than its competitors. However, it trades at a discount to its competitors' average P/S and P/E multiples. In this instance, I think the average is more useful than the median, as it accounts for both the unprofitable competitors as well as the previous acquisitions, whereas the median seems skewed to the 40% of the data set that is unprofitable.Applying these average multiples to GlobalSCAPE, we again find that the company may be slightly undervalued:Conclusion:In my view, GlobalSCAPE's refocusing on its core business, CEO transition, deferred revenue, and positive risk/reward profile make now a compelling entry point for medium-term investors.I recommend investors enter into a small position before 3Q, and if financial metrics are solid, build up a position from there. While some returns may be taken off the table, the story (risk) should get much clearer, as well.Other Factors to Consider/Things to Watch:Supporting DocumentsEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2695435,76695,2014-11-19T11:54:51-05:00,"GSB was recently trading at $2.47, with deferred revenue up 30%.The company's cash flow per share annualized is around 25 cents. Its P/FCF per share is 10.It has no debt, 90% GM, and 67 cents cash per share.","GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB) is the purveyor of a secure information exchange platform for transferring mission-critical data, both intra-company and externally with partners. They have a 20-year history and provide military-grade encryption to the U.S. Army and most of the Fortune 500. In addition to the security element, the company meets the many compliance requirements in highly regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and retail as dictated by the likes of HIPPA, SOX, and PCI. They are ranked as ""Champion"" by Info-Tech for managed file transfer, which is the highest-ranking category.Product Metamorphosis and EvolutionOriginally, EFT (enhanced file transfer) was a dedicated server and software stack for addressing the rigid security standards for information transfers that were deficient in standard FTP (file transfer protocols) software. The enhancements entailed a library of encryption options, user credential validations, DMZ Gateway transit architecture (minimized data exposure on Web) as well as others, and continue to expand in scope. In response to sensitive data sharing ingressing and egressing the company, the quest to monitor employees' use of data became paramount. As a consequence, an outlook email plug was developed and the conceptualization of the product as a company-wide platform emerged.CatalystThe next evolution in the product will focus on collaboration and file sharing. This module, tentatively called Workspaces (due out at year-end), can be layered on top of the existing platform to create an open environment to facilitate information exchange in a more frictionless environment. By leveraging the company's heritage in robust security and compliance, they will be able to create a safe place for multi-person project/task management.Enter the mobile workforce: Companies today want to enable their employees' productivity, desiring them to be accessible anytime, anywhere (BYOD). The company recently introduced mobile apps that integrate into the EFT platform. In concert with Workspaces, the mobility module should provide sought after functionality being requested by existing clients to enhance employee productivity. A parallel initiative called Tappin Enterprise is also scheduled to be released in Q1 2015 and will be a free-standing product. It is unclear what the difference in feature sets will be. It would seem to be more of an attempt to capture the existing installed base with Workspaces, and greenfield opportunities with Tappin Enterprise.Financial MetricsThe company's Q3 2014 GAAP is $0.04, and the trailing is P/E 20. A more insightful earnings power calculation: Take free cash flow nine-month YTD 4M and annualize it -- you get 5.3M. When you divide that by 21M shares outstanding, you get a P/FCF per share of 10, which will ultimately become the future P/E. The deferred revenue, which grew at 30%, will be recognized as revenue going forward even though the cash has already been collected, giving rise to the attractive P/FCF per share calculation.Other MetricsCompetitive LandscapeThe competitive landscape is formidable, with multiple competitors in the traditional EFT market including Axway, Attunity (NASDAQ:ATTU), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and others. However, GlobalSCAPE is considered the leader by Info-Tech.In the file sharing and collaboration market, its competitors are Box, Dropbox, Sharefile by Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), Accellion, Hightail and others. GlobalSCAPE will be entering into this multibillion-dollar market with some distinct advantages to traditional cloud providers (Box/Dropbox). Their solution will offered on premise for greater control by retaining critical data behind the company firewalls and not in the cloud. They have a proven legacy of trust via EFT product among the Fortune 500. In addition, they have demonstrated that they build world-class software and are a bonafide leader in the EFT market.At closer look at Box reveals both promise and peril. The company has filed an S-1, which revealed some enlightening facts. The company delivered $124M in sales and has a high growth rate. The company has a private value in excess of $2B. What alarmed investors was that heavy spending on marketing and customer acquisition yielded a net loss of $168M. Box serves as both a validation of the collaboration market's size and growth rate.From a product standpoint, there is some consternation by CIOs of having data reside in the cloud where it is more vulnerable to being breached. This would have implications for Dropbox and other cloud players as well. Another criticism of Box has been the perception that revenue is derived from storage. This premise is flawed. The company is in the business of productivity enhancement and back office automation. The big question for Box hinges on stopping the red ink and fending off competitors. For obvious reasons, customers prefer vendors that are financially stable with reliable roadmaps.The competitive landscape will coalesce around several factors. There's the decision of whether to deploy in the cloud, on premise or some hybrid model. There's ease of use and deployment; companies want intuitive software that requires little employee training. There's the effectiveness of the vendors at capitalizing on their installed customer bases. Lastly, there's the developer's responsiveness to customer's desire for product feature augmentation.RisksGlobalSCAPE is a micro-cap with a market capitalization of approximately $50M. Some caveats would include lower trading volumes and higher beta movements with respect to price.SummaryGlobalSCAPE is a world-class software company embarking on expansionary market opportunities. This, in addition to existing profitability, a strong business in core EFT, and compelling value metrics, yields a enticing value proposition. While the marketplace in general is competitive, the company has a proven track record of excellence with over 10,000 customers including most of the Fortune 500. The recent addition of over 150 distributors to its channel program and 30% growth in deferred revenue speaks to the recognition that the company's products are in demand. The company could be poised for rapid share price growth if they can capture some of the new opportunities from entering the adjacent markets in collaboration/productivity, given the leverage in the model and existing profitability. The risk/reward here is favorable.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

That's a top line increase of 44% over last year.  Cash  and short term investments grew to $9.1 million, or about $.51 per  share.CEO Jim Morris expects even better performance in the second half of  the year:While GlobalScape is known among consumers for its CuteFTP software,  enterprise products drive most sales by dollar volume and account for  virtually all of GlobalScape's revenue growth:A $1.30 stock with $.51/share in cash and securities, growing and  profitable businesses, and a reasonable PE multiple sounds great.  Let  me be clear — I am long, having purchased  GlobalScape in smallish quantities back in March between $1.46 and  $1.49, and having added to that position today at $1.30 ahead of  earnings.   But like any investment thesis there are risks: (1)  GlobalScape has made a $2.3M investment in CoreTrace.  Early indications  are positive but if CoreTrace flops then this will have to be written  down; (2) the chart is not great.  There is an overhang of sellers, but I  don't know how much.   Yesterday's news might shake them out, but if there  is another block to go then any pop could easily fade.  Watch for a  sustained move above $1.55, which would flip the technical picture to  positive; (3) if the positive guidance doesn't pan out, shares could  trade down substantially, even from here.

2305935,68095,2014-07-09T10:49:44-04:00,"GSB has strong and growing recurring revenues.There are questions about the future of managed file transfer and GlobalSCAPE.It's hard to back a software company where its key product is a rated as a feature, not a solution.The SaaS products have yet to contribute.It would likely be better strategically in someone else's hands.","GlobalSCAPE (NYSEMKT:GSB) was founded in 1996 and has products and domain expertise around managed file transfer (MFT) over the Internet. The diagram below outlines the functionality in the company's lead software product, Enhanced File Transfer (EFT), which accounts for 79 percent of sales. These capabilities ensure electronic files are moving nationally and globally in compliance with government and corporate security policies as well as privacy regulations.Source: Globalscape.com.The San Antonio, Texas, headquartered company has just 103 full-time employees, yet an impressive 10,000 business customers. The company generated $24.3 million in revenues in 2013 with 79% being EFT product revenues, indicating an average sale value of under $2,000 per year. This lowly average sale value explains the company's greater focus on resellers and away from direct sales.The value in GlobalSCAPE sits firmly in the company's growing level of recurring revenues. The company generated $13.7 million in support and maintenance revenue in the 2013 financial year, up 11 percent in 2012. The strength of the business model is highlighted by support and maintenance revenue growing 20 percent per year over the last three years, and now accounting for 56% of sales against 42% in 2010.The $700-$800 million Managed File Transfer market is rated as ""mature"" by IT industry analysts and open to innovation. The industry appears extremely competitive but fragmented, with GlobalSCAPE as a leading vendor in the file transfer space accounting for just a 3 percent market share. I can't quite figure out if the managed file transfer industry will eventually be owned by networking type companies, or whether GlobalSCAPE has the deep domain knowledge and engineering know-how to enable to grow as an independent file transfer company.The company actually acknowledge this in their 2013 Annual Report: ""We continue to believe the market will shift toward consideration of traditional MFT as more of a 'feature' than a solution."" The company is responding to this dilemma by moving deeper into collaboration, cloud as well as greater integration with other systems.GlobalSCAPE boasts that its leading vendor status is partially attributable to its TappIn product. The consumer focused TappIn product provides the capability to access data stored on the user's personal computer or network from a remote location using a tablet or smartphone. The company plans to integrate the TappIn technology into its core EFT product creating an enterprise solution.Also on the more innovative end of GlobalSCAPE'S products is the company's software-as-a-service, file transfer applications (MIX, Hosted Mail Express, and Hosted ETF). The cloud based products which are hosted by the likes of Rackspace have yet to make a material contribution to sales or profits. These products are undoubtedly losing money, so any sales turnaround here will quickly flow to the bottom line. There is little evidence, however, of success from its acquisitions nor success from organically developed products.GlobalSCAPE should continue to benefit on the back of the massive growth in data being propelled globally. Managed File Transfer providers may also benefit as the security weaknesses of traditional internet sole transfer technologies (FTP, HTTP and SMTP) are exposed. The company has been growing its core MFT revenues over recent years, so there feels little reason to doubt GlobalSCAPE won't continue doing so in the next few years.The 2013 investment metrics look reasonable with the highlights including the attractive enterprise value/revenue multiple of 1.6 times as well as the healthy enterprise value/maintenance revenue multiple of 2.9 times. I like to see companies investing into research and development with GlobalSCAPE spending a respectable 19% of sales (this figure includes research and development being capitalized) in 2013. The future share price growth is dependent on continued growth in support and maintenance revenues from the core Enhanced File Transfer products, in addition to GlobalSCAPE gaining real traction in its newer SaaS products.This company feels like it would be more valuable in someone else's hands as GlobalSCAPE'S acquisition and organic growth strategies have not amounted to much, to date. It's also difficult to recommend a software company that openly acknowledges its core technology is more of a feature than a solution. I will watch this one as it has some attractive investment metrics, particularly around recurring revenues; however, it's difficult to get too excited about GlobalSCAPE.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2190683,59321,2014-05-05T09:34:37-04:00,GSB is 90% undervalued on an EV/EBITDA and DCF basis.GSB has been generating ROIC that dwarfs its WACC by 2x.GSB will likely generate FCF of ~15% in 5 years.GSB will compound revenue at even faster rates as its new third-party distributor model begins to take hold.GSB has a fortress balance sheet.,"Company: GlobalSCAPESymbol: GSBRecent Price: $2.37GlobalSCAPE (GSB) is what I believe to be a GAAAP (Growth at an amazing price) stock! It's not every day that one comes across a company that has a pristine balance sheet (debt/equity of just ~20%), and continues to grow revenue and free cash flow as steadily as a violinist's bow hand. GSB will continue to compound recurring revenue, EBITDA (op. profit + D&A), and free cash flow as it executes upon its strategy of focusing on expanding its domestic distributor and partner network. On a DCF and EBITDA basis, GSB is worth between $4.57 and $4.60, respectively, implying ~90% upside.Business OverviewGSB is a leader in the Managed-File-Transfer industry (MFT). Simply put, GSB offers the solution to an ever-increasing problem: transferring confidential information from one computer to another (or with the recent launching of the company's mobile app, from one smartphone to another-or smartphone to computer). The company breaks it revenue down into 4 categories: software licenses (33% of revenue); maintenance and service (M&S) (56% of revenue); professional services (6% of revenue); and other (5% of revenue).In 1996, GSB launched CuteFTP, its first file-transfer product that was aimed at smaller businesses. CuteFTP was and continues to be a success (4/5 stars on TopTenReviews, and 3.5/5 stars on Download.com). Since then, the company has expanded its product breadth to meet the needs of larger enterprises. As per its recent investor's presentation, some of GSB's customers include Xerox, J.P. Morgan, Hewlett Packard, Virgin Atlantic, Microsoft, and the U.S. Army. One of the largest of GSB's customers is the U.S. Army, which in June of 2013 exercised a first year contract option (out of a 2 year contract) to extend the contract to July of this year. GSB will receive $1.45 million of M&S revenue during this period, and if the U.S. Army exercises the second option, GSB will receive $4.4 million over 3 years, potentially making this the largest contract win of the company to date. It is also very important to note the importance that has been placed on GSB by the U.S. Army: out of 3 different vendors, GlobalSCAPE was the only one that could meet the government's list of requirements (view them here), and according to GlobalSCAPE (emphasis added), ""no other product meets, or can be modified to meet, the government's needs without a substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays.""Much of GSB's revenue streams are recurring and are expected to compound substantially as the company executes upon its strategy (more on this later). Recurring revenue, for the most part, includes M&S revenue and subscription revenue for its SAAS offerings. The company believes that due to the compounding effect that will-and has-taken place, operating margins will continue along in accretive fashion.Beginning in 2007, it is clear to see just how successful the company has been at growing its revenue and margins. Barring 2012 and 2008 for non-recurring events (abnormally large operating expenses in 2012 which have since reverted, and the financial crisis in 2008), the company's average Gross margin has been sitting at 96%, and its average EBIT margin has been sitting at ~14%. It is also well-worth pointing out that the company has almost no debt, and for the years between 2007 and 2010 the company operated with no debt at all. A detailed income statement is presented below.GSB has also been able achieve a 7 year average ROIC, calculated as NOPAT/debt + equity (while barring the black swan years) of ~14%, which dwarfs its 3 year average WACC of ~7% (I assume a cost of equity of 9%).StrategyGSB outlines its current strategy as the following:· Developing new solutions and enhancing our existing products.· Increasing sales through expanded third-party distributor channels.· Growing recurring revenue.· Establishing leadership in broader markets.· Extending presence in the secure content mobility market.· Growing enterprise and government sales.· Developing corporate brand.Historically, GSB has derived most of its revenue from direct sales, but that is largely about to change. The company has been rapidly adding third-party dealers to distribute more of its products and services. This diversification will allow the company to quicken the growth of its M&S and license revenues, as well as allowing the company to keep its operating expenses much lower than if the company attempted to penetrate new markets with its own employees. A growing customer base equals a more rapid revenue compounding effect, and because of the company's ability to compound annual revenue since 2005 at a rate of ~19% through direct sales, it seems logical that with the build-up of third party distributors, revenue will likely grow at a faster pace going forward.According to the CEO (emphasis added): ""Channel sales can help us establish a lower test delivery model through which we train and position the partners to sell industry solutions. We will leverage this approach to reduce our overall cost of marketing and selling our solutions in a direct fashion. Additionally, channel partner supplemented our demand generation efforts and provide access to client bases that previously would not have been available to us.""With GSB generating substantial value over its cost of doing so, and along with an average 90% renewal rate within its customer base, I believe this adequately shows that GSB's business is rather ""sticky"" and that the costs of switching MFT service providers is high.Free Cash FlowGSB is asset light and currently generates ~10% unlevered FCF yield. With management hinting at focusing on growing the company more organically in its most recent 10-K, I believe the company could achieve yields of ~15% (using the current market cap) in 5 years. A back-of-the-envelope valuation, assuming GSB can achieve $.335 per share in FCF, values the company at ~$3.50 per share if I place a 10x multiple on FCF (lower than its current 15x multiple). On this basis, the company is undervalued by ~40%.ValuationThe crux of my valuation thesis rests upon my DCF model and a 15x multiple of forward EV/EBITDA. I will present my DCF model first.I believe I used a conservative revenue growth estimate, as I only assumed the company would be able to grow revenue incrementally by 50 basis points annually. Keep in mind, also, that I discounted the FCFs by 11%, which I believe may be a bit too conservative, considering that the company's estimated WACC is only 7%. If I had discounted the FCFs using WACC, the stock would be undervalued by almost ~200%!To explain the multiple I applied on my estimate of forward EBITDA (I believe the company can achieve ~$5.5 million in a conservative calculation of EBITDA-on an adj. basis, EBITDA will be much larger), I looked at other software companies (GSB derives revenue from multiple sources, but I felt software companies provided decent comps), and generally I found said companies trading at 15x EV/EBITDA [2 such companies include Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS)]. Currently GSB's EV/EBITDA sits at a meager 8.4x, and forward EV/EBITDA sits at ~7.3x-I believe these multiples are far too low for such a profitable company.The company's net cash currently stands at ~11% of the total market cap, and I believe that with such a large cash balance and along with the company's current stance of pursuing growth organically, going forward it seems likely that special dividends will be distributed to shareholders, as they have been distributed for the past 2 years. While more speculative, I also believe GSB provides a good acquisition target.ConclusionI believe GSB is an attractive investment, and at its current financial trajectory I think the stock is worth at least 90% more than where it stands currently. With a strong history of generating consistent revenue growth, along with generating a ROIC that is 2x its WACC, and a FCF yield that will likely hit 15% within five years, I think GSB is an obvious GAAAP stock.Disclosure: I am long GSB.

193478,20101,2010-03-14T05:02:10-04:00,,"My latest purchase was microcap stock GlobalScape (NYSEMKT:GSB), a file transfer software and managed services company. Computer users know it best for its low end FTP products, CuteFTP and CuteFTP Pro. But that’s just a small fraction of its business. The revenues are mostly from the more advanced, server-based file transfer programs like EFT Server and EFT Server Enterprise. Managed file transfer services are also growing.OK, so the business is pretty boring. For a tech company it's difficult to find something more mundane than file transfers. As a stock, however, GlobalScape has a lot to offer. I bought GSB over the last several days at $1.46 to $1.49. Here are three reasons why:1. Fundamental turnaround. After several periods of growth, GlobalScape posted both a sharp decrease in revenues and a GAAP loss in 2008. The poor results hit shares hard, sending them down below $.60. While the full year 2009 results are not out – and won’t be until the end of March – it looks like GlobalScape has returned to both profitability and revenue growth. For the first third quarter of 2009, GlobalScape posted revenues of $4.296 million, or 14.83% more than last year, and earned over $575k. There is always event risk going into an annual report, but GlobalScape faces easy comps.2. Positive newsflow. A series of positive press releases in the beginning of March, especially this one regarding new deployment of the high end EFT Server products at AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), helped spike the stock intraday to $1.75. Though it quickly retreated, I like to see the stock influenced positively by the newsflow.3. Technical setup. See that 15% jump, now fully retraced, in early March? That spike and retreat formation has always served me well in microcaps. It defines the risk — 10% down from here, and the pattern has failed. But if it holds, it's usually just a matter of time before the spike high is taken out and 52-week highs get challenged. The longer-term picture is also bright. After gaining over 300% in just 5 months, shares have had a healthy pullback and consolidation. Anything can happen here but the path of least resistance appears to be facing north.DISCLOSURE: Long GSB."
2099153,46171,2014-03-21T05:00:00-04:00,GSB has missed the market run-up in recent years and remains one of the few companies remaining with compelling valuations.Secular tailwinds and incentivized insiders should help yield at least 72% upside in next two years.Fortress balance sheet provides substantial downside protection and minimizes risk of permanent loss of capital.,"IntroductionWith the market near all-time highs, I've begun to dig into the small-cap space to look for pockets of value that still have yet to be tapped. One particular company that I've found recently, GlobalScape (NYSEMKT:GSB) has many of the characteristics of my favorite investments: strong financial position, aligned insider incentives, secular tailwinds, and cheap valuation. From here I think that even using conservative assumptions shares have 72% upside within the next two years (a 31% IRR) with minimal risk of permanent capital impairment.Company BackgroundGlobalScape develops and distributes software and hosted solutions, and also provides a variety of services associated with these products. Their main business line is personal file transfer products, which are sold over the internet to enterprise customers located around the world. These solutions allow customers to deliver and share critical information related to sensitive subjects, such as financial data, medical records, and customer files. Using a variety of information protection approaches, GSB provides a secure platform for business units or company employees to share data in a secured environment. Enhanced file transfer products currently comprise about 78% of revenues. GSB also provides a variety of related solutions such as data replication and information backup and recovery, and also maintains a professional services division. Combined, these supplemental offerings represent the remaining 22% of sales.Like many software-as-a-service (SAAS) providers, GlobalScape has an attractive business model. Capital expenditure needs are minimal, and 90+% gross margins give the business substantial operating leverage as sales grow. It's then perhaps not surprising that the company get returns on equity north of 25%. These numbers should actually continue to improve over time as a higher percent of total revenue is derived from Maintenance & Support sales (M&S), which is generally recurring. Not only does recurring revenue lead to great visibility that can often lead investors to assign higher multiples to the stock, but it also is generally higher-margin. GSB increased its M&S as a percent of total revenue from 50% in 2012 to 54% in 2013; with renewal rates described as 'high' in the company's SEC filings, we think M&S will continue to increase its share of revenue in the years ahead.GlobalScape's security solutions are employed by many multinational corporations who need a way to securely share information across a massive interconnected network (Microsoft, IBM, and Verizon are just a few examples). Notably, they're also the provider of choice for the US Army, which one could argue holds perhaps some of the most sensitive information in the world. Indeed, the software is used by the Army to move large amounts of logistical data around the world to support thousands of troops and numerous military operations, actions for which information security is nonnegotiable.The success of its products hasn't always had the same results on the company's stock however. After getting as high as $7 a share in 2007 after a multi-year run on the basis of strong earnings growth, the stock collapsed along with the rest during the financial crisis and has more or less treaded water since then despite business growth (see chart below). The result we have today is a company trading much more cheaply on most relevant metrics than it has in recent years. This is especially true after the stock sold off in February following the release of their 4Q2013 earnings report, in which they reported flat sales and missed EPS estimates by 2 cents. The results were somewhat disappointing but not disastrous, and certainly didn't warrant the stock losing a third of its market value. (Source: Google Finance)Why Attractive as an Investment?As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, there are a variety of reasons why GlobalScape is an attractive investment opportunity at current levels. We think the business is nearing an inflection point and could be poised to begin another upswing as investors catch on to at least some of the points below:Consistent History of Growth: GlobalScape has grown revenue and gross profits at a steady pace over the last five years. EBITDA and net income have been lumpier, but we think that operating leverage should begin to kick in as revenues continue to grow. Keep in mind that this was done in a more challenging economic environment than the one today; GSB now also has the benefit of the industry tailwinds discussed below.Secular Tailwinds: How many times have you heard about prominent companies having their data breached in recent months? Here are just a few noteworthy examples from the past year:-Target-Neiman Marcus-Adobe-SnapChatNot only do these breaches generate a wealth of negative publicity for companies and potentially tarnish their brand image, they're also extremely expensive. To illustrate, here's a graphic from the Ponemon Institute on the cost per person of breaches in various nations. The US is second, only behind Germany:(Source: Ponemon Institute)Target's latest quarterly results also provide a stark warning, as their net profit for the fourth quarter fell 46% year-over-year as a result of the breach. A recently released survey provides some color into this, and suggests that customers have altered their buying habits when it comes to the retailer.Thus, when viewed from a short-run or lifetime customer value perspective, a data breach can certainly impact a firm's bottom line. As stories about these breaches continue to pile up, and as hackers continue to get more sophisticated, companies will be more inclined than ever to invest in systems that will prevent them from becoming the next victim and object of consumer scorn. This graphic summarizes the rise in popular interest of security solutions; I believe this increased interest has not gone unnoticed by corporate leaders, and should drive meaningful demand growth for the entire industry. As a leader in the field, this should be a substantial positive for GlobalScape going forward. 9% growth in year-over-year deferred revenue provides evidence that this is indeed beginning to occur. (Source: Google Trends)Strong Financial Position: GlobalScape has $9.4 M in cash, which is over 20% of its current market cap, and only about $3 M in debt. As a result they have a net cash position and a debt/equity ratio of just 18%. What's more, the business has only modest capital expenditure needs, which has allowed GSB to produce prodigious free cash flow on a consistent basis. This gives them plenty of flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions or to return capital to shareholders. In both 2012 and 2013 they paid a special dividend, and we think at today's depressed valuation it would make sense for them to implement a large share repurchase program. On the conference calls, management has indicated that capital return is currently being prioritized over additional M&A. The announcement of another special dividend or a buyback could serve as a strong catalyst and cause shares to rerate.Aligned Insider Incentives: Determining whether insiders have the same interest in the stock appreciating as you do is always an important investment consideration, and is especially vital for smaller companies that generally have fewer eyes on them to monitor their behavior. GlobalScape is 43% owned by insiders, which gives them strong incentive to pursue shareholder-friendly policies. Nearly 31% of this is by Thomas Brown, who serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, executive compensation is a good mix of salary and long-term incentives tied to stock price performance. Insider activity has been neutral as of late, with no record of any buying or selling.Cheap Valuation: GlobalScape appears substantially undervalued using a variety of valuation metrics:GSB also throws off a substantial amount of free cash flow, and is currently trading at just over 10x that figure. By comparison, its closest peers currently have an average EV/FCF of 22.8. I think this is more than a fair price to pay for a business that generates 90+% gross margins, consistent revenue growth and cash flow, and high returns on invested capital.Potential Buyout?Software has historically been a very active space for M&A, so it's important to evaluate the likely outcomes should GSB become a target. Though I have not seen or heard anything indicating that such transaction may be on the horizon, GSB's strong position in an attractive niche, high levels of recurring revenue, and relatively small size would make it a potentially interesting target for a lot of companies.Past deals for companies similar to GSB have generally been done in the range of 2-3x EV/Sales, while GlobalScape currently trades at 1.6x. Applying the midpoint of the range at 2.5x, a takeout offer would value GSB at ~$3.60, which is nearly 60% above the current quote.ValuationBoth a comparables analysis and a more robust model suggest substantial upside for GSB equity in upcoming years.ComparablesFirst I want to expand a bit on the info provided in the ""Cheap Valuation"" section above. Using a group of companies that have a product line similar to GSB's SaaS offerings, I found the median values for each of the metrics above, then used those values to determine what GlobalScape would be worth if given market multiples. Here are the results:Model AssumptionsThough GSB does not provide explicit guidance, our research indicates that it seems likely the business grows in both 2014 and 2015. We think based on GSB's strong competitive position it's fair, and probably even conservative, to model the growth rate of being equal to that of the industry. The latest projections call for 10-15% growth, so we'll use 12.5% here. I also assume modest operating margin expansion as a result of increased recurring revenue and the effect of greater operating leverage. GSB debt has a low interest rate that reduces the risk of prepayment, so I've assumed minor interest expenses for both 2014 and 2015. The company's effective tax rate has varied wildly in recent years and quarters; I've set it at 15% (which is in line with the 2013 figure). I conservatively model no share buybacks and P/E ratios below both industry and GSB averages to arrive at a target price.Thus, while the single sell-side analyst covering GSB projects earnings to decline slightly in 2014 we see them remaining flat, with cash flow generation remaining strong as well. Using a normalized free cash flow calculation yields similar results:All in all I expect GSB to be worth at least $4 a share by 2015, which represents a 72% premium over current prices and equates to a 31% IRR. With conservative inputs for both multiples and margins, there could be some optionality to the upside as well. To illustrate, if we were to assume GSB were to get back to its ten-year average multiple by 2015, shares would be worth $7. Alternatively, if they managed to hit a mid-twenties operating margin that year (like several peer companies), the new price target (~$5.80) would be about 46% higher than the estimate provided in the model even if the EPS multiple remained constant at 17x.Downside protectionFurthermore, we think the company's large pile of cash and strong balance sheet provide downside protection, as GSB should have the dry powder needed to opportunistically return capital to shareholders. And, with a high percentage of insider ownership, any material decline in the stock's price should stir a strong reaction from the company.RisksAs with all investments, there are a few notable risks to the thesis that are worth discussion:Fairly new management team: In September 2013, CEO Craig Robinson tragically passed away from complications during a surgical procedure. The new CEO, James Bindseil, has been with the company since 2010 and previously served as the senior vice president of client operations. He hasn't been on the job long, but so far we have been impressed with the work he's done and expect him to continue the business momentum Robinson initiated.Spotty capital allocation: Past management made two acquisitions (TappIn and Core Trace) that have not panned out and whose future prospects appear questionable at best. Additional ill-advised acquisitions could mitigate the benefits of the company's strong FCF generation. That said, management has indicated that M&A is not a priority or necessity for GSB in the foreseeable future, which eases our concern here.Competitiveness of sector: Technology is a notoriously competitive industry where participants are forced to choose between continuing to innovate or risk falling behind. GSB currently has a strong competitive position, but this may erode over time if they don't continue to improve their systems on a regular basis.Possibility of GSB Customer being hacked: this would obviously be a large negative public relations hit and damage the firm's reputation. There isn't much of a way to handicap this, but thus far GlobalScape's track record has been great.Lack of explicit guidance makes financial projections subject to greater error: management does not provide specific financial guidance, so making assumptions about GSB's future performance requires a bit more guesswork and is thus subject to a larger degree of error. However, I believe my conservative model assumptions will prevent this from playing a large role.ConclusionIn a market where most stocks seem to be offering a less-than-compelling margin of safety at current levels, GlobalScape appears to have flown under the radar. We think it has a potent combination of features that often lead to investment success, and expect shares to begin to trade materially higher once Wall Street catches on to the story. Though GSB has a fairly small market cap, it's still large and liquid enough to be suitable for nearly all personal accounts and small funds. And, with upside of at least 72% within the next couple years, I think it's worthy of a close look.Disclosure: I am long GSB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

36324,20545,2007-05-23T14:59:17-04:00,,"Globescape (GSCP.OB) announced yesterday that it would repurchase $3 million in stock, or just over 6% of the total shares outstanding. Essentially, management just said, “We are going to take the stock to $3 and get an AMEX listing.” Anyone who listened to the conference call understands that management is really targeting an AMEX listing and that they are going to do what it takes to get there.  This was one of my recent additions when the stock price dipped to $2.25, and the stock has already had a nice 17% bounce since then. Yesterday’s news comes as a bit of a surprise, given that microcap companies seldom buy back their own stock, but those who listened to the GSCP conference call for the first quarter probably picked up on the fact that management was looking to enhance the share price in order to achieve an AMEX listing. It was obvious to everyone that management was frustrated by what they perceived to be an excessively low multiple for a company growing 30%+ per year, and yesterday’s action indicates that they are going to take matters into their own hands and move the stock up above the $3 level for an AMEX listing. The buyback is certainly a step in this direction, and I still believe GSCP has significant further upside here as a result. Although I’m sitting on a very nice short term gain, I still believe there is more upside left here, and I’m not selling because I believe that I would be leaving a lot on the table. This is a nice vote of confidence in GSCP shares, and it should put a nice bottom under the stock over the next few months. I still believe this company has big upside if they can procure another big contract with the DoD, and the business seems to be gaining momentum in the last few quarters. GSCP 1-yr chart"
40882,20691,2007-07-12T08:52:13-04:00,,"GlobalSCAPE (GSCP.OB), a provider of Global Managed File Transfer [MFT] solutions and wide-area file services [WAFS] technologies, delivers a modular approach to solving the enterprise challenges of security, bandwidth, latency and regulatory compliance. GlobalSCAPE’s products securely and efficiently move files such as financial data, medical records, customer files, intellectual property, and other sensitive documents of any size between supply chain partners and branch offices. GlobalSCAPE’s products are used by mid-sized and large enterprise companies, including virtually all of the Fortune 100, leading technology, banking, healthcare, and public sector organizations. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, GlobalSCAPE is also the developer of CuteFTP, the most popular file transfer protocol application on the market. Fundamental Analysis: GSCP has experienced a large amount of growth from 2004 - 2006, with an 800% increase in net income over the course of those two years, which explains why its share price has increased from a slim .15 cents/share in early 2005 to yesterday's close of 4.19, equating to a staggering 2700% gain. Currently, GSCP is trading at a 37.08x earnings multiple, compared to the software programming industry average of 27.5x, making its current valuation extended. Though given a low forward P/E of just 12.32x, less than 1/2 the industry average, investors and traders aren’t hesitant to continue to drive price action in favor of the bulls. For the current year 07′, GSCP is expected to report revenues of 20.34m on .3 eps, which entails an 85% increase in revs and 87% increase in eps from the prior year 06′. As we head into 2008, the high growth story is expected to slow to down to around 16% annual change. Though given the future growth into 07′ and 08′, and GSCP currently just a small company at $72m cap, I think price will continue to trend up, especially given the current technical setup. As GSPC expects to report eps of .34 in 2008, we could hypothetically say that GSPC should be trading around $8 - $9/share in the coming months to be fairly valued in the software programming industry. As the industry average P/E is currently trading around 27x earnings and GSPC is expecting .34eps in 2008 (.34 x 27) ,GSCP should be trading around 9.18/share in the future to be fairly valued in the software programming industry. Being that software companies usually have very high margins, their ability to maximize income as revenue increases is staggering. In 2006, GSCP had a profit margin of 95% while their net margin was just 17%. But as revenues increase dramatically(85%), their profit margins will likely remain similar, while net inc margins increase significantly. This is because SGA and RD aren’t increasing nearly as much as revenues, which in turn causes the increased revenues go straight to income. This is why earnings for 07′ are increasing 87% when revenues have increased 85%. As revenues grow in the future, the majority of the increase in revs will go strait into net income. Technical Analysis: Looking at the 3 year weekly chart GSCP looks extremely bullish as price first broke out of its descending wedge pattern on heavy volume. Since then it has consolidated and now has broken out to its all time high close as we are in midweek.  Looking at the shorter term chart, GSCP has had a huge momentum run from a low near $2/share to over $4/share as of todays closing price. Price formed a small symmetrical triangle pattern which had an upside breakout today on above average volume confirmation suggesting a continuation north. Currently price is down to around 4.12 AH, i would like to pick up some shares near the midpoint of todays candle and breakout point around $4/share.  Over all this looks like a great stock to speculate on as its technical setup looking at the longer term weekly chart is extremely bullish, along with a strong fundamental backing to supply buyers along the run.

1859251,48781,2013-11-23T17:54:38-05:00,,"Investment thesisGlobalscape (NYSEMKT:GSB) trades at a mid single-digit multiple despite strong growth prospects, a high free cash flow yield and a ""valuation multiple"" enhancing business model transition. The net cash position and rising cash flow limit downside risk while the significant discount to private startup valuations provides upside potential.Company overviewGSB and its wholly-owned subsidiary TappIn provide secure information exchange solutions for enterprises and consumers. GSB serves clients primarily in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia in the finance, healthcare, energy, retail, manufacturing and engineering markets.Revenue is generated from software licenses, maintenance and support (M&S), professional services and SaaS subscriptions.Strong growth + margin expansion + high free cash flowThe seemingly modest revenue growth of 3% in the mrq should be taken in context. For example, the high operating leverage inherent in the software industry drove a ~73% increase in EBITDA. Moreover, management said on the 3Q13 conference call that YTD revenue is the highest in company history and predicted faster revenue growth going forward.Moreover, a high percentage of incremental revenue growth translates into cash flow as a result of aggressive cost control (e.g. lower spending on online paid advertising in favor of search-engine optimization), effective capital allocation (e.g. withdrawing from endpoint security market after it matured) and low capex requirements. This cash flow provided the ability to reward shareholders with special dividends this month and in December 2012 as well as reduce debt from the TappIn acquisition from $7 million to $4.7 million.The ability to efficiently manage growth should not be taken for granted as many tech companies experiencing strong growth such as Twitter struggle with expenses rising faster than revenue.Despite being at the intersection of multiple growth trends (e.g. increasing use of mobile devices and the cloud, SaaS, increased regulation regarding data, information security, exponential increase in information sharing), GSB still trades at a low multiple more appropriate for a print newspaper facing a secular decline in demand.Source: Company presentationTappIn (acquired in December 2011) is one of the largest (and most overlooked) growth drivers. TappIn allows users to instantly access and securely share files stored on an office or home computer from any web browser or mobile device. This eliminates the need for uploading, syncing or paying for cloud storage.The increasing worker mobility, multiple content storage locations and exponential rise in data creation/sharing creates a large and growing demand for TappIn's services. For example, according to Cisco, mobile data traffic in 2012 was ~12x the size of the entire global Internet in 2000 and is projected to increase 13x from 2012-2017. Although the trend of ""bring your own device"" should continue, there is a significant concern for employers that creates an opportunity for TappIn. For example, according to a Harris Interactive Poll one-third of respondents using a personal device for work admit the data is not encrypted.Investors are ignoring the successful business model transitionThe multiple for GSB is backward looking and more reflective of where the company has been rather than where it is currently or going in the future. GSB deserves a higher multiple as the following three factors should provide a more diversified stream of fast growing and high-margin recurring revenue.Moving up the value chain. GSB has come a long way from being a consumer products company with one primary product (e.g. CuteFTP) in the mid 90s to a diversified enterprise solutions provider. GSB now has more than 15,000 enterprise customers that provide more than 90% of its revenue while its CuteFTP consumer products provide less than 5%.GSB continues to move up the value chain through product enhancements (e.g. add-on modules*, merging TappIn technology with EFT editions), which should drive revenue growth from new customers as well as by upselling to existing customers.Moreover, the numerous product awards and partnerships with larger companies such as Rackspace and ESET allow GSB to ""punch above its weight"" in a competitive industry. For example, GSB recently gained one of the largest domestic pharmas as an EFT enterprise customer.*Mail Express allows users to securely send files of unlimited size instead of using insecure and unapproved methods such as USB drives.Geographic expansion. A recent expansion into Latin America and Asia should drive a larger non-U.S. revenue contribution than the current 26%. The use of channel partners should result in lower marketing expenses while receiving revenue in USD virtually eliminates foreign currency risk.Growing high margin, recurring revenue. The significant growth in M&S contracts driven by high renewal rates provides GSB with a growing high margin, recurring revenue stream. Moreover, management noted a ""compounding effect"" as higher license sales drive higher M&S renewals.Investors should focus on the long term benefits of the subscription model (e.g. steady revenue stream, increased visibility) and not on the short term side effects (e.g. lower upfront license sales). An excellent example of a software company that successfully made this transition is Adobe.Valuation disconnect creates attractive entry pointEven ignoring the previously mentioned positive fundamentals, GSB is attractive on an absolute and relative basis as well as to past M&A multiples. For example, PE firm Thoma Bravo paid $1.3 billion for internet security company Blue Coat Systems or ~19x EBITDA.Insiders (that own almost half of the company) can be forgiven if they fail to understand how a private startup such as Dropbox that provides a tangential service is valued at $8 billion while GSB has an EV of $32 million. This is even more remarkable given that private market valuations are typically lower than public market valuations.While an argument can be made that the current valuation for Dropbox is too high, an even stronger argument can be made that the valuation for GSB is too low.Moreover, the current valuation for GSB implies little to no value for early stage growth initiatives such as the cloud-based MFT product or TappIn integration with Seagate. There would be no value disconnect if the market implied little value for every company with growth initiatives currently contributing little revenue. However startup valuations (e.g. Snapchat, Pinterest) and even public company valuations (e.g. Twitter) imply massive growth driven by the exact same trend that should benefit GSB - mobile.Furthermore, the persistent ""microcap discount"" is even greater in sub-$100 million market cap stocks. Unfortunately for GSB, it will most likely not receive any significant analyst or media attention until the market cap rises at least 10x. In the interim, forward thinking investors willing to go ""off the beaten path"" should be rewarded with this alpha rich opportunity.RisksThe software industry is subject to rapid technological change, low barriers to entry and intense competition.A decline in economic activity would most likely result in lower IT spending. GSB is relatively insulated from overall lower spending as its products significantly reduce customer expenses (e.g. moving to the cloud eliminates hardware/software spending) and provide ""high priority"" benefits such as data security and transfer.A decline in defense spending would negatively affect GSB as a portion of its revenue is generated from U.S. government contracts. This risk is mitigated after the U.S. Army extended the current contract to July 2014.ConclusionThe price target is based on a 8x EBITDA multiple. This is conservative given the previously mentioned factors as well as the fact that the EBITDA used is backward looking and assumes no growth.A stop loss should be placed below $2 or ~6% below. The time frame is 12-18 months given the time required for recent efforts by management to gain investor attention to produce tangible results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
